"now , i have been stressed with fixing this laptop since every day has been something new that i need to fix with it .",0
"now i ' m just down to some gripes that are probably here to stay : the bluetooth on this thing is really fussy , the non - functional video output ( using usb - c video out through an hdmi cable sends just a blank desktop background and no audio , even if i am playing a movie or youtube visibly on the c302 screen ) , and that it can ' t hold a vpn connection without dropping it every 20 - 30 minutes .",0
"on it ' s own , it performance great !",2
on the other hand my least favorite feature is the track pad .,0
one day it just would not power up .,0

price was very good and met my expectations also shipping was very quick .,2
pros : lightweight and looks nice .,2
"quality is excellent so far , and the software / hardware combination works like they were made for each other ( which is what you want : ) )",2
returned because had it less than a month and it decided to go crazy and start typing by its self ect .,0
returning it after one day,0
screen is amazing,2
screen is good .,2
"seems unlikely but whatever , i ' ll go with it .",1
set up is take out of box and open cover .,2
"setup was fast and easy , but then again i ' ve been a gmail / gcal / gdocs purist for a while now .",2
should not of bought this chromebook .,0
similarly the task tray area of the main task bar is on the small side and lends itself to fat - fingering .,0
"so , i have had this laptop for almost a week and have put it through the ringer .",1
"so android is fun for tablet features , but its like embedding an android inside , without letting android apps out to utilize the full abilities of the chromium system .",2
so far i ' m enjoying it .,2
some apps don ' t work but the play store is still in beta right now,0
"sometimes they felt a bit half - baked , but i loved the idea , and the keyboard made a world of difference in what you could do with that tablet .",2

the chromebook was packaged well and we saw no defects ( ours was used ) .,2
"the first issue is that the speakers are on either side of the computer , and you can barely hear them on max volume .",0
the funny part is that the customer service people have been great but they have no control to take care of problems .,2
the intel iris sucks .,0
the keyboard is stiff and unresponsive to my typing at times .,0
the laptop its - self is great and is made of good build quality .,2

the machine ' s visible design itself was fine .,2
the manufacturer was not helpful in trying to resolve this issue .,0
"the mouse pad is very touchy , but i use a separate bluetooth mouse anyways .",1
"the native chrome os media player would play the files from the drive but had very limited playback capabilities , i could not get it to ` ` play all ` ` , only repeat one , suffice to say i was frustrated at that point and did not feel like googling how to make a media player do what others ` ` just do ` ` .",0
"the new touchpad takes a little getting used to , but otherwise it ' s been perfect .",1
the only drawback is that it only comes with 32 gb of hard drive .,0
the overall material the laptop is made of feels incredibly cheap .,0
the picture clarity is amazing and the backlit keyboard is awesome .,2
the plastic that borders the screen kind of comes out ever so slightly .,0
the ports were another thing that i was really excited to see fully included on a laptop in this price range .,2
"the processor on this chromebook is one of the best you can get on a chromebook at this price ( i did plenty of research ) , but you start to notice a lag when you have more than 3 browsers open at once .",2
the product looks reasonable at this price range .,2
the retina screen is amazing .,2
"the screen is plenty bright , and the sound from the speakers is fine for a laptop ( you won ' t be filling a room with sound ) .",2
the screen is really amazing and you can easily change it to 1080p with no issues ( it ' s set lower out of the box ) .,2
the screen is very dim however .,0
"the screen looks amazing , ips it seems .",2
"the speakers are super clear and get loud enough , but obviously lack bass .",2
the wall power adapter charger is not working and then later caught fire .,0
there are several traps inside and outside of laptop .,0
there is a lot of ' bang for your buck ' in the lenovo ideapad 320 .,2
these macbook pro computers are expensive .,0
thin bezels allow for a compact frame,2
"things are less clear here ; the toshiba again has better performance , and uses a real ssd , but it has less impressive build quality and even less impressive materials ; it does offer a backlit keyboard and an even nicer screen , still the nicest of these three .",2
"this chromebook looks and feels great , performs even better and will soon support google play apps .",2
this computer has wasted so much of my time already .,0

"this little vivo had the speed / storage that we need , the materials feel substantial instead of cheap .",2

"this unit is ` ` pretty ` ` and stylish , so my high school daughter was attracted to it for that reason .",2
this version has been my least favorite version i ' ve had for the following reasons listed bellow the pros .,0

usb port go dead until i do a restart .,0
"using it for doing programming , app development , and electronics projects .",1
