overall good laptop .,2
overall great chromebook .,2
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .,2
overall the laptop is cheap and flimsy .,2
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .,2
perfect size to use in bed and nice and bright .,2
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .,2
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .,0
poor design and terrible tech support .,0
"poor touch pad , it get stuck .",0

shipping was fast and product came as described .,2
"since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .",0
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .,2
sleek design .,2
"so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .",0
"so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .",0

"so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .",2
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .,0
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .,0
something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .,2
something is wrong with the power management .,0
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .,0
sound is really low while using an aux speaker / headphone .,0
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .,0
spacebar doesn ' t always accept input,0
"speaker ' s are ok but not amazing , i do like that they are mounted on the sides so they work well in laptop or tablet mode equally well .",2
speaker : good speakers but not the loudest .,2
ssd hardware issue,0
"still , for $ 450 i ' m a huge fan of the screen and the excellent overall build quality .",2
stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !,2

terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .,0
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .,0
the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .,0

the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps .,0
"the core m3 processor allows the c302 to be fanless , as well , adding to the sleek design .",2
the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing .,2
the device is so sturdy and clean looking it is a pleasure to hold in my hands .,2
"the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever .",2
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .,0
"the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !",2

the graphics are great .,2
"the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !",0
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .,2
"the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .",2
the keyboard is backlit and big enough for my fingers .,2
"the keyboard is comfortable to type on , although i haven ' t done so for more than a 1 - 2 hours .",2
"the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .",2
"the keyboard is often - praised , but i don ' t find it particularly spectacular .",2

"the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .",0
"the only drawback is that it does not run the native android versions of microsoft office , and they should warn you about that .",0
the only drawback to the device so far is that it ' s not especially comfortable to use in tablet mode ; the edges of the bezel are little too ` ` sharp ` ` to comfortably rest your palms and at 2 .,0
the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life .,0
the only thing i didn ' t like is the screen isn ' t bright enough and the speakers aren ' t louder .,0
"the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m .",2
"the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .",2
the picture quality is very good and the book itself is responsive and fast .,2
the plugs are good and bad .,1
"the product is great , but the customer support is horrible .",2
the product itself is awesome .,2
"the pros definitely outweigh the cons , earning this chromebook 5 stars .",2
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .,2
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .,2
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .,0
the screen does look good .,2
the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so .,0

the sound is really terrible and tinny .,0
