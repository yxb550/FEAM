reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .,0

- the rma process needs improvement - buyer must pay to return the product for repair .,0

but you can ' t use an acer chromebook r 11 this way .,0
definitely the best chromebook out there .,2
i will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths .,0
