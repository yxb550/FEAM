"I'm a seller. Amazon gives refunds to buyers without a return. All any buyer has to do is say they are dissatisfied, call Scamazon, say they want a refund. Bam, the buyer gets a refund and the product. There are better sales channels out there, look for emerging sales channels. This site NEVER, EVER decides in favor of the seller.",0

"Tried to buy new alarm clock. Had to enter e-mail and password. Entered password. Then it asked for password and captcha. Sent e-mail I had to confirm all just to log in. Finally logged in. Tried to check out. Wanted password. Entered password. Then it asked for password and captcha again, even though I had already gone through that just to log in. Would not let me check out. Called customer service. First person transferred me to second person. Had to give all the information again. He transferred me to a third person. ""Your account has been locked out because it has been so long. We'll have to connect you to our security..."" That's when I hung up. NOT WORTH IT!!! I'll never use Amazon again!",0

Sometimes not the cheapest but Amazon never fails to have excellent products at excellent prices.  I love the fact that when you buy directly from them and the product is not to your satisfaction you can send it back for free.  I made the mistake of buying Dr. Marten boots from ebay instead of Amazon and because they were too big had to pay a whopping £7.50 to return them.  I was gutted and vowed never to buy shoes from ebay again!  Amazon all the way!,2
Always great customer service,2
I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1
"Since 2006, we have placed almost a hundred orders with Amazon.com.  To the best of my memory, we have never had to contact customer service, and we have never had any bad experiences with Amazon or with anyone who was selling on Amazon.  They seem to be a very well run company.  I realize that not everyone will have such good luck, but their overall record is probably very good.      For $90 a year we get amazon prime, which means we get free two day shipping on most items that are ordered directly from Amazon.  Since we get the free shipping, it is very difficult for other websites (where we usually have to pay shipping) to compete with Amazon.  That is why we end up placing most of our orders with Amazon.  Amazon prime was a smart idea.      What makes shopping on Amazon such a great experience is that alot of people write reveiws of the products on Amazon.  That helps us alot when we make our buying decisions.      I do not recall any bad experiences with the vendors who sell on the Amazon marketplace.   However, some vendors are slower than others.  If you order from an unfamiliar vendor, be prepared to wait.      So far, we have been very satisfied.   Hope they keep up the good work!",2
"Amazon don’t care about consumer rights.  I bought a lawnmower, after I bought it they bumped the price by £170, then told me it was lost in transit.  Really how can you lose a lawnmower.  The refused to send a replacement, but offered a refund, which meant that I would have to pay an extra £170 to buy it again,  Really dodgy selling practises.  And a clear breach of my rights to get a replacement,",0
I've had 2 accounts closed because I supposedly violated terms and policies! How you ask from asking fro refunds on items that I had not received and they said they were delivered. When investigated I was told that they were indeed delivered when in fact they were not. I literally spent thousands on amazon. It's the best place to buy my Anime stuff. I would continue to spend thousands if it wasnt for my account being closed then I made a new one and it was immediately closed. Super upset and dissatisfied and disappointed especially when they didnt even consider were they were putting my packages or even that some of them would come weeks after saying they were delivered. They will steal you money and then call you a liar.DO NOT USE THEM!!!!,0

"I love shopping with Amazon.com because they make it so easy, and I am always satisfied with everything I buy.  They also offer so much in the product line.  I really like the ability to purchase music through the Amazon MP3 and choose only the songs I want, and the Amazon Cloud is great!",2
"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer assistance woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer assistance calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after order before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other goodss minutes after order.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1

This is honestly one of the most gross things that have happened to me while ordering Amazon fresh I ordered mayo 20 FL OZ and it came it I have started opening my package and the state of the mayo was just oil with chunks of white s hit that looked like semen I shook the bottle to see a big blob the bottle was unopened still having it's seal didn't expire until September 17 2022 idk what temperature they keep there food in but it's obviously the wrong fuc king temperature to be sending out s hit like that that get the order two hours before delivery time and can't even realize they grabbed and bagged a disgusting looking mayo to be sent out,0
Amazon shipping is no longer reliable in terms of delivery times. The last 3 I ordered  have not arrived.,0
Fed up  waiting  in for delivery  the drivers sometimes  doesn't   knock just but card thought  your door  and just run off. The only  time I would  given Amazon 10 out 10 is for there lockers. Unfortunately they don't  have these  in Madeira. What a shame.,2
"I ordered a cricut joy from Amazon and I picked the time they offered for delivery. When it didn’t show up at the time they promised, I discovered it was in Texas still. I live in Florida. I then found out it was being sold for $20. Cheaper. Because it was so late they gave me a discount and promised they would get it to me the next day. I saw it eventually made it to the Lakeland Amazon distribution center in Fl. 2am. In the morning. When I woke up, it was still there, but my other package that was there shipped and was out for delivery. At 3pm I called them and before they picked up my phone call a notice came across my phone saying it was being delayed. Ok, still waiting for them to pick up my call. Some guy finally answered, and said it got damaged and my only option was put my money back on Amazon credit or back to my account. After waiting three days extra and they did nothing to fulfill my order. I tried to write my review, but they wouldn’t publish my review because it wasn’t about the product. I could not find a place on Amazon to complain about there shipping, and there should be a place. I got my cricut joy and also bought a hammock elsewhere. They lost about $400. From me over shipping. I wish I could just not buy from them anymore, but from now on they are my last choice to do my business with.  Also the money they promised to give me on my account for the late shipment disappeared, so they just took back the machine and canceled my reimbursement. Shame on you Amazon.",0
"Good, friendly support, quick and easy.",1
Products are overall pretty acceptable. But order is horrible. So many things have not been delivered on time. UPS delivered way better than Uber or prime order trucks. Very frustrating.,1
"I bought a backpack with Fulfilled by Amazon and encountered a problem with payment processing which resulted in 1 day shipment delay. (they accepted my payment method, but later rejected it. They could've rejected on the spot and I would've tried to sort it out immediately) This annoyed me because it defeats the purpose of me paying a premium for AmazonGlobal Expedited Shipping which values S$18.44. I shared my concern with Amazon customer support and they promptly waived my total shipping & handling fees of S$25.65 to S$0. I thought it was a courtesy talk-only customer service, but 5 minutes after the live chat ended, the change reflected. I was amazed. With this, it's enough for me to trust Amazon and shop confidently with Amazon.com in the future ^_^",2
"If I could give you a stars I would. I am not sure how Amazon delivery services cannot read an address. I'm going to assume that they use GPS location when they're delivering products. So how do items get delivered to a completely wrong address not even the correct street. I have no idea where my items went. But I have a picture and according to Amazon I can ""check to see if someone else has it""... Well I shouldn't have to. That's why I pay for Amazon prime! Worst part is, the items today are things I really needed this evening!! Ugh!!",0
I have had many items from amazon. Like they products and delivery very good to excellent.,2
I ordered a EGO mower via Amazon.com ($5300 purchase). The shipping company the seller used refused to deliver the mower to my home and it was sent back to the seller without ever being in my possession. Amazon has a A-Z guarantee that states they will refund your money if an item is not delivered. Today I got an email from Amazon stating that I am not eligible for the a-z guarantee and therefore will not refund my money. No explanation of why they say I am not eligible.   I have been a loyal customer for many years and recommended them to many of my friends. No longer will I do any business with them and will tell my friends to not use them also. I would rather spend more and pay shipping on items than give them one more cent of my money.,0
"The store needs a total overhaul, function is LOST in search and sort. The site CHANGES DEPARTMENTS when advancing to the next page of results, which also changes your results. There must be no management whatsoever on navigation and how the store functions. It is not worth the prime membership anymore. The people in charge at amazon clearly do not care.",0

"2024 has been one unpredictable shipment after another. When purchasing, you are given choices as to shipment dates. Purchase may be averaged between dates. However, when promised same day or next day, the on going accuracy has been off by a couple days and the tracker is slow to update until items are within minutes of house. It's hot and I'm old, so grabbing before ruined is sometimes a factor and scheduling when I'll be there to take it inside.",1
What Amazon is doing is to make money on your return by holding your money for 30 days or more.SHAM ON AMAZON,0
"AMAZON, VERY POSSIBLY THE WORST BIG COMPANY ON THE PLANET WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER CARE,,, IT SHOULD BE, ""CUSTOMER (WE DO NOT) CARE""!Now, I have no problem with saying that parts of the issues stem from my somewhat limited computer skills and my eventual loss of patience. The loss of patience however, was exacerbated by the Amazon System and the people I had eventually encountered.The System: I believe Amazon is one of the biggest companies on the planet and deals with such large volume of commerce giving them EXTREME POWER OVER SOCIETY AS A WHOLE,,, CONTROL OVER SELECT GROUPS,,, AND AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUAL GOES... GREASE FOR THE GEARS! Amazon (and other huge companies highly advanced in technology) want to eliminate the ""Human Factor"" from their companies. They want ALL COMMUNICATIONS to be done with bots/A.I. on their end of the transactions... keep taking money from people to continue their automation and computerization. THEN, AS WAS WITH ME, the System failed. A $30 golf club arrives in bent box, broken in half. Needed to ask a question, (may have been somewhat or partially answered in their jumble of ""prepared answers"" if not in the first 50 or so maybe in the second group of 50 or so or 3rd group,,,). I struggled a bit but found a link to live chat. WHERE IT SEEMS MOST SITES YOU GO TO, YOU GET BOMBARDED WITH POP UP ADS,,, AND MOST JUMP RIGHT OUT WITH A, ""LET'S CHAT NOW, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH TODAY"", I had to search around and when I got to the page, I started with a question, it said somethinglike,  ""chat has been started , you are #1 in queue"". About 20 minutes later, I did what they wanted, I ENDED THE CHAT, WITHOUT EVER GETTING ANY REPLY. So next is the attempt to call. Forget it. Not after West Coast work hours, unless you do not mind talking with some whoever, from wherever on the other side of the planet. I mind. Conversation with foreign dialect/accents is tough enough then add the stress brought about by personal and financial information in a world loaded with scammers and con artists. After running into a couple of walls with offshore AND NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING YOU ANY HELP WITH CONTACTING A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMPANY. EVEN GETTING TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR IS A BATTLE WITH SOME.SO,,, I call the U.S. Corporate phone #. WORTHLESS! IF AMAZON IS LOOKING WHERE TO SAVE SOME WASTED MONEY,,, ELIMINATE THE ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER"", ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. HEARTLESS. SOULLESS, UNCOMPASSIONATE GROUP THAT DO VERY LITTLE TOWARD HELPING (ME ANYWAY),,, AND THEY LIE! CHECK Y'ALLS RECORDINGS! The U.S. CUSTOMER SUPPORT PHONE #, basically 5 prompts. 1- customer service- gives recorded instructions to GO ONLINE. 2- instructions. 3- instructions. 4- instructions. Prompt #5- THE LIVE PEOPLE THAT DIRECT YOU TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE,,, THEY ARE JUST THE CALL CENTER,,, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE NUMBER I CALLED THAT EVENTUALLY RETURNS TO THEM!WHEN YOU START GETTING LOUD BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LISTENING WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT DOING WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO DIDN'T WORK AND ASK ""NOW WHAT?"",,, THEY THEN HANG UP ON YOU. AFTER TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY EITHER AREN'T LISTENING OR DON'T UNDERSTAND, THEY HANG UP ON YOU. BETWEEN THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND THE LIVE AGENTS IN THE CALL CENTER IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON, I CONTINUED TO CALL JUST TO GET A SCRIPT READ TO ME SAYING THEY HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE HELP AND GUIDEANCE AVAILABLE AT THEIR LEVEL AND THEN HANG UP ON ME... WOULD NOT TELL ME WHAT TO DO WHEN WHAT THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO DO DOESN'T WORK.It concludes with a final attempt at 1 of many AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE #s. A guy in India that said he was a supervisor with the ""escalation team"", highest level you can get by phone he said, but I had spent literally HOURS dealing with the Devil, and it boils down to AMAZON UPPER LEVEL COULD CARE LESS WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THEIR FEET AS LONG AS THEY ARE CONTINUALLY BLINDED BY THE MONEY.",0

"Has it's acceptables and has its averages... Not sure what outweighs what.Having Prime means next day shipment - more and more frequently shipment is being delayed. When you are able to speak to an agent, they offer compensation however this is never actually applied to your account. The last adviser I spoke to Hazel was very rude. I attempted to report her however was unable to do so.",1

"topped up my amazon account with £200 from my debit card and amazon locked it. 3 weeks of sending in my bank statments, bank card and even a selfie with my drivers licence and they still wont unlock or even refund money back to the card it came from. customer service just giving you the same speech from a screen by sounds of it and saying its account specialists that deal with it and can only reach them by email. Joke of a company. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",0
I paid for an item and never received it. Amazon have not customer support option and only offer a return item option. Seller sent a pre scripted email and didn't bother to try to resolve the issue either. Amazon and the dodgy seller wiped their hands clean of the issue but happily kept my money. This is what i would consider an online scam. They only get away with it because their name is AMAZON.Update---------Amazon did eventually refund me for this item. The fault was with Royal Mail. They falsely claimed they delivered a parcel. I have a camera in front of my door. They lied.,1
"The customer service is mediocre at best. I have been waiting for almost 2 weeks for someone to contact me and unlock my account even after I explained to them that it was hacked and the situation has since been resolved. They keep asking me about a ""form"" that I need to fill out, and then they say that they have completed the form and someone will contact me the next day. I've been hearing this every other day since 10/30/2020. I understand that there's a pandemic happening, but that should not stop the workers from doing their job in a decent timeframe.",0
Amazon is garbage. Will never get another penny from me. They only refunded half of my money and I can't get in contact with customer service. Smh,0
"Some great, some not great. Product offering is fantastic. Markup on the cheap stuff is not. But if i Use their App then that is on me. Easy returns. Free shipping. Good to go",1
Amazon overall deliver a fine support but it can fall down when some of its suppliers provide a very average support. In my case I bought 3 cat Webbox  sticks from Staks and Co. They offered no return support. I paid £8.19which I had assumed  was for 3 X 3 packets of Webbox Cat sticks and so I paid £8.19. They sent me 3 so i paid £2.73 eachper  packet when they only cost £1.00 in Morrisons. Don't use Staks and Co unless you are very rich.   Oh and no returns.,1
Amazon is becoming more expensive with little benefit. Shipping delays. Wrong items received all the time where it becomes my responsibility to return the item or pay for an item I never ordered. Walmart plus has been great their customer service is so much better to deal with. Bye amazon.,0
Amazon is a rip off . Today they took 12.99 put of my account without my authorization for a membership trial that's not over until may. I called to speak to a customer service rep who stated he was gonna submit a refund in 3 days I got upset because u inconvenience me now I have to wait to get my money back that is not good enough . I ask to speak to a supervisor he tells me no you can't speak to my supervisor and began laughing on the phone saying he not letting me speak to anyone over 12.99 and hung up the phone . I'm sure I'm not the only one this happened to . class action is on its way .  you will not take my money when u feel like it and tell me to wait 3 busjness days and hang up that's totally unprofessional,0
Super Slow Delivery... A bit disappointed,1
"I've been a loyal amazon customer and I'm a little upset that the return policy is difficult. I ordered a large corset and it wouldn't even rap around my waist . I bought a size smaller so I could lose weight to get  into it but i can't because it will take me like 3-4 month to lose enough weight to squeeze my body i the small corset !!I feel like the packaging could b a little more friendly . Maybe some candy or a business card , but of course it's not up to Amazon.",1
"I haven’t had a terrible usage but I also haven’t ever had a great usage with Amazon. It’s solid if you need something within a few days and you don’t have time to go to the store, but only if you actually order though Amazon and not one of the other sellers on the platform. Those are hit or miss, some are reliable and some are not.",1
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the shipment. Then they give you an approximate shipment date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"NOT HAPPY! I placed a big order that cost 455$, i was not only charged 455 twice, but amazon is giving the hardest time about getting that payment back. i provided amazon with the upmost proof to show i was charged  twice. not only have i been dealing with dispute since 3/04/2020 now i am being ignore via email. when i call the agents are confused to what i am talking about. at this point i am canceling my account and will be doing business else where. i will say this is the first time it has happen since i been a customer since 2015. thanks Quilla",0

"Brilliant value.  Excellent service in the unlikely event that the product needs to be returned or replaced.  Very speedy service.  Fantastic range of products; from buying bargain books several years ago, Amazon is now my first port of call for just about everything - they rarely let me down for choice or competitive price.

Amazon, I understand with Covid-19 shipments are delayed in shipping; however, please changed your page setting to not say ""if you order in 3 hrs and 15 min"" you have have your order the next day.  I am a prime member and pay my prime membership; however, I do base my orders on when I can receive them.

Not so, we were in and listening for the order - having tracked it. But no ringing of the bell or knocking of the door, just dumped.I’ve tried to find a place on their web site to report this - it’s not the first time - to no avail!! Sad really as parcels they send by Royal Mail or other support always come with a ring or knock!! Making this a reliably, safe order. That’s really is my only complaint about an otherwise very fine company!",1

"Dont try to buy anything guaranteed same day. I haven't had anything delivered same day even though guaranteed. Full of excuses about things being out of their control. This time, the items I bought are Amazon items, not delivered same day because of delay but rescheduled for delivery today. Still nothing due to issues ""beyond their control"". Their warehouse is 15 minutes from my house. There were 3 Amazon vans in my housing area all at the same time while I was driving home from work. How can their product being delivered by their vans less than 15 minutes away be out of their control 2 days straight? Then, when I ask for a refund, I get the run around and my status on the orders say I refused the packages when they delivered. IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED!!! This is the 3rd time they pulled this crap. The first two times they promised gift cards (which I never received). I don't need them anyways. Goodbye prime, goodbye Amazon!!",0

"Sharp decline in assistance. When I started using Amazon about a year ago my main concern was if I could return items if they didn't work out. I tore up my knee and can't get out to do my purchases and Prime seemed to be a fine option aat that time. I could use Prime video and returns were easy. I could take my return to the UPS store half a blck away and they would print my label, scan the item and done!  Recently everything has changed for the worse. They no longer use the same courier company and all the options for drop off are too far for me due to the mobility issues. The free pick up option looks fine until you spend the entire day waiting for the pick-up only to get notified at 9pm that you have been rescheduled for the next day. This goes on for days sometimes. I'm sorry, you wanted to shower or take your dog out to pee? Too ordinary. Most recently I recieved the okay from customer assistance to leave my pick up at the door and when I got out of the shower they had only picked up one of the two items that were in the same box. By the way, contacting customer assistance is almost impossible. Good luck finding the link to request a call or actually talking to a person. The AI call doesn't give you the option to talk to a person, you have to know to say ""talk to a person"". The chat doesn't actually chat, it is just more self help. They don't want to know what their customers think.Then there is Prime Video. All the shows I was watching suddenly came with a price tag. The garbage that was left has comercials and isn't worth watching. I haven't watched anything on Prime for weeks. I bought one movie that I will say finebye to if I cancel but it may be worth it.As for the items, hit or miss as usual. If I am familiar with a brand and it works for me it is usually a safe bet. Otherwise it definitely is a gamble.",1

"Recently they start sending the verification link to your phone. By some reasons it never comes to some of the phones because of the notification format or cell provider setup or by some other reason. When you call them the first time they say it is a system glitch and should be fixed in 24 hours. And as you can imagine it never happens.  Attempting to reset that over their 800 number is just waste of your time. I spent several hours on the phone with them. I gave them all the information they needed including the phone #, credit card numbers, billing address, email, last transaction codes from my bank statement but this is not enough!  They ask you to name last three purchased items and if you do not remember the exact names of the items you purchased  you can not pass their security check!  Is not this weird? These guys become crazy. I am not going to use them any more. I hate all that. And I feel sorry for my time and nerves.",0

"Amazon deserves negative stars.  I have (had) been a customer for DECADES.  Today I had my credit card information stolen.  Someone used my credit card that is tied to my bank account to place several online orders with various vendors.  I contacted three of them to report the issue, after I contacted the bank that issues my credit card.  All three vendors immediately stopped payment on the fraudulent orders and assured me that my bank account would be reimbursed within 48 hours.  However, when I contacted Amazon Customer Support to report fraudulent use of my credit card, this is what I encountered:  (1) Asked for last 4 digits of credit card used; (2) name on card; (3) date and amount of charge - I provided all of this information.  Support indicates that yes my card was used for that amount on the date provided, but the name on the account was different, and that I had to provide any ""guesses"" as to the name that was used on the account.  Seriously, take a guess.  Hello, you are asking me to identify someone that stole my credit card information!  When I could not take a ""guess"" as to the name on the account, I asked for the name that was used and I was denied this information because Amazon had to ""protect the name used"".  So let's just protect the person that stole my information and not provide me with any help.  This went back and forth for several minutes.  I asked for the name and contact information for an Amazon Supervisor and this was denied.  I indicated I wanted the charge taken off of my credit card - denied - told it was my bank's responsibility, not Amazon's.  I explained how other vendors immediately did not question the fraudulent charges, and removed them ASAP.  Oh and let's not forget.  Last week I placed an order with Amazon, and afterI reported the fraudulent issue, I received an email that my payment was being denied for fraudulent use.  Just brilliant - the order I did place is denied payment, yet the order I did not place goes through, and I cannot dispute the charges.  After this fiasco, I immediately closed my Amazon account  and I will never do business with them again.",0
"It's time to explore other ecommerce options. Amazon is too big and too inconsiderate to address simple issues even for its Prime members with Amazon cards. My story: (multiple cases) every delivery was riddled with issues, the most recent and disturbing - the delivery person handed my package to someone else with a different name and a different address and marked it as delivered. Now Amazon would like to me to wait for the next day to call back and began an investigation.",0
"I’ve been using amazon prime for let me guess lol I think like 5 year now never had a problem with them I enjoy the free two day shipping it’s amazing, & the fact that they actually take a picture and post it to your account showing that they left it by the door is straight peace of mind... so then you just know your neighbor stole it lol but your are for sure they delivered it. I’ve only had one wrong order and the seller immediately fixed it gotta appreciate great, fast & now somewhat more secure delivery 🚚 my husband hates them because I order just to much it’s a bit obsessive you can find any and everything from dishware to cute boots🥰🔥",2
"When things go wrong, extremely poor customer services with a complete lack of action. Ten days ago after receiving a delivery from Amazon, I found a Coke bottle full of urine on my garden! Having reviewed my home’s cctv their driver can be seen removing the bottle from the rear of his van and depositing it on my lawn. I have raised the matter several times with their customer services department, and have had many assurances that I will receive a call from the local manager I have heard nothing. The bottle still remains and I have sent further emails without reply. I have now reported the matter to police.",0

"I love Amazon! Great products, quick delivery, excellent customer service, but... Double check prices with other sellers, Amazon isn't always cheap. Often it's not even Amazon, but a 3rd party seller on the Amazon platform. Track your delivery with shop.com to make sure you really get it. With doorstep thieves running around, have them drop off the package at a pick-up location if nobody is home, or it may be gone before you get to it. Great return policy, no questions asked.",2
"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day shipment was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the goods.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day shipment is bs.  I’ve had several two-day shipment packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the shipment would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day shipment mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the goodss sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1
"The shopping usage on Amazon has been mostly positive, with a wide selection of goodss and convenient assistances.  However, improvements are needed in packaging to prevent damage during transit.  Occasional order delays and inconsistencies in goods information should also be addressed.  Despite these areas for improvement, I appreciate the convenience and variety offered by Amazon.",1

"Amazon brings products to me which I was able to select based on a decent amount of information provided to me on the website. Pricing is clear, monetary transactions work smooth, security on login etc. seems high. 1 star less as it started delivering products via it's own branded vans, which results in me, living in NL, not being able to make selections about where and when the package is going to be dropped off anymore (e.g. package delivery station on the next day or anything like that)",2

"I really enjoy using Amazon for online shopping but the order drivers do NOT make the usage worth it. They are a disappointment almost every time & I barely get my packages from them when they come to my house! They will leave my house with the package while I'm home due to them not reading the order instructions. Which are very simple instructuons. It's not even worth the hassel any more & thinking about cancelling my prime. They have excellent costumer support, but it's becoming a waste of money because of the driver's. So so sad",1
"I never received my order, Amazon's incompetent courier driver had delivered it to another address on the apartment complex I live in. I was emailed to say the item had been delivered through my letter box but it hadn't, so can only assume it went elsewhere?? I contacted Amazon and spoke to what I thought was a compassionate advisor (Sashaneal.S.) she promised to call me on the 17th Jan as she advised she wasn't able to offer an immediate refund but would be able to do so within 48 hours (on this date) I never received the call and cannot be bothered to go through the whole ordeal again, so now I have been left out of pocket due to two incompetent Amazon staff! Great service Amazon! I've been a prime member for a while now and I'm seriously considering cancelling my subscription with them. The calibre of staff is decreasing, I had an Amazon delivery posted through my letter box the week before, which was intended for the floor above me. I would rather buy from the stores and pay a little more than buy from Amazon and end up without my order and out of pocket!",0

I work for an apartment complex that the drivers can never deliver to the correct address (one would think you must be able to read to deliver packages).  I have tried to have packages picked up for that don't live hear any more 1 customer service rep saide they would call back with someone to pick it up and never called back the 2nd person said that couldn't be done, just keep the package. This is a billion dollar business that they can not even have people trained is the same manner. If anyone else in the really world would do this they would be fired or the business would be shut  down.",0
"Prices are very high, buyers are hardly ever protected, especially international customers using freight company address for shipping-just like me. Amazon allows drop shipper sellers who are not aware what they are dispatching. If your item is not as described you are experiencing monetary loss. Regarding customer support: it used to be very decent back in the years but now most of them are sleepy and I even have a feeling that they did not understand English and they are using some online dictionary to see what you wrote, frequently they provide with irrelevant answers. Not all of them but most do. Amazon VS eBay-better buy on eBay, eBay has unbeatable prices at least.",1
Amazon needs to get there heads out of there asses. Because they lead me to believe I was getting a package on time but it was out of stock and mad me wait 3 weeks believing it was instock.They didn't notify me at all.And when I asked the customer service people each time they would drop me I went through 3 people before I said screw it I'm canceling it.That's the last time I spend 600 bucks for anything on Amazon.,0

"Amazon Delivery is terrible.  Even though drivers for every other services easily access our gated community, Amazon Delivery drivers often have problems.  If they make it through the gate, they then seem to have trouble finding my front door.  I've had packages left in the alley behind my garage door and at my neighbor's addresses and others just never show up..  Last night was just another example of bad service.  Even though Amazon's GPS tracking indicated their driver was just a few houses away and my delivery was next, my delivery never arrived.  Amazon's GPS tracking showed the driver instead drove to a location about 1/2 mile away and just stayed there before shutting off his signal about 45 minutes later.  My delivery of bedsheets needed for guest  last night never arrived",0
"Purchased a lot of items and shipping was always in time. Product prices are sometimes more expensive than in a nearby store but gladly pay a few cents extra with the convenience of fast delivery.

"I find Amazon generally supplies fine customer assistance, fine prices and deliveries. However, the continual tricks used to trip people up when placing orders, making other methods of shipment (such as choosing prime) so bold and prevalent and presenting things in a confusing manner very frustrating.Prime, is only any fine for deliveries coming from Amazon itself. Music, TV and other assistances are only given to tempt you to pay more to see the rest of the TV series or the music track you really want to hear. Take music for example. Amazon music is free with advertising, to a degree. Then you have music prime with no add’s. But to get the full Amazon music, you have to pay again. No thanks Amazon.",1

"I've always wanted to purchase things from Amazon, since they have a variety of items and brands that I love but the most annoying thing is, they will never deliver items to my country. Only to my neighbouring countries OR when the item is available to my country, it is out of stock. But after reading everyone's reviews on Amazon and here, I think I should be thankful that I couldn't purchase anything from this website, considering how they actually accept used and returned products and then sent it out to other customers. I've seen way too many reviews mentioning that. The chances of me getting a used item is high, so no way I'm gonna purchase stuff from Amazon. And some of the sellers would actually sell fake stuff too, so nope. I ain't gonna patron Amazon.",0

The problem is that I cannot even write a review, saying the profile is not eligible, even though I bought the product, and tried it, and it doesn't work... I cannot inform other people about the issue and other people will buy too this garbage product. The excuse is that I have to spend more than usd 50 in order to write a review.This is the product I bought and it is counterfeit, it doesn't work. Even though it says the same name, it is not the original: ACS108-6SN from Paialu on Amazon. I do not recomend it.",0
I have never dealt with such a sorry company in my life. Amazon has the most messed up charging practices and shipping practices. Their customer service is horrible when asking for help. They are the most horrible place to order from. I have packages coming from the UK that cost less and got here faster. This is ridiculous. Wish I could leave 0 stars.,0

"Amazon is dropping the great customer support they use to have by allowing sellers to dictate the length of time to get your refund whenever an item is Not received, instead of issuing a gift card with credit one has to wait for about 7+/- days to receive money which you had already paid..unacceptable customer support and decent use of public funds if you multiply every customer",1
"Amazon is piloting an extra charge for one-day delivery for Prime customers. Don't fall for it. Gave it a try and Amazon failed miserably. Not only did they not deliver early as promised and charged me for, but now the package will be delayed - something that is also occurring regularly since Amazon started their own delivery service. By the way, Amazon does not refund the ""expedited delivery"" fee even if they deliver late! You have to cancel and reorder.",0
"I use to only buy amazon but in the last year constant issues, from damaged items, very delayed shipments, to not refunding promptly after receiving my return. Subscriptions doubling in price on the 2nd shipment without notice, Finally, They don't allow me to write honest reviews if they are below a 5, they refuse to publish saying review doesn't fit their guidelines. Didn't Lowe's and Home Depot just get fined for that??",0
Amazon has the WORST customer service. These people truly make it known they don’t give a *%#^ about you or the issue that you are experiencing. Also many of these people are so incompetent that I would rather be dealing with a primate.,0
"I can't deny that amazon has always made it right. If a product has been misrepresented, defective or has some other problem, my money is refunded and the shipping to return it is always free. Also, when something didn't arrive by the promised shipping date, they extended my Amazon prime membership a month. I'll take that. I've also ordered the wrong cables for a kindle and they helped me to get the right ones and didn't charge me extra. I am really satisfied with their customer service. One of the many reason, I'll stick with them.",2
"Just got off the phone with Amazon. If you ever follow their instructions to cancel a shipment that has been shipped via Amazon Logistics, don't. If they always ship to you via their Amazon Logistics, think about it seriously. If the courier marks the package as ""refused"" and doesn't return it to an Amazon facility, Amazon will try to refuse the refund if one of their ""top notch"" couriers decides you don't need the item but they do. According to Amazon Customer Service, I am responsible for THEIR courier. I don't remember that job interview..",0
I don’t like Amazon because they advertise things for sale that are out of stock. I had a very bad experience just over a year ago when I bought a book. Like many people I ticked free postage.BEWARE! If you click Free Postage you will inadvertently sign up for Amazon Prime.I did not know I had done this until I had to change my bank card because of a security scare. I then had a phone call from Amazon saying they could not process my Amazon payments. I was horrified and thought it was a scam. I then rang the real Amazon and they told me I had signed up to Amazon Prime. I was appalled and cancelled my Amazon Prime account.I gave the card number of the expired card which was safe to do.  I then received a phone call from BT saying my call to Amazon had cost £80.BT refunded half of this as a goodwill gesture. Beware of signing up to Amazon Prime if you click Free postage. I lost several payments of £7.99 and £40 so lost about £80. Disgusting company who are conning and tricking people into signing up for Amazon Prime. I tried to download a kindle app the other day but discovered I could only use the app to read a book if I buy the book off Amazon. No chance!Other thing I hate about them: you can’t use PayPal.,0
I kept losing my amazon packages and they gave me refunds and help me find a solution. They have delivery stations which are near me and more reliable.  the chatbox  was quick and directed me to a human being quickly. ,2

"Amazon is becoming very unreliable now. I've been dealing with them for nearly years. At the end of last year, I was ordering products for my business. When they stopped arriving. I contacted Amazon but no response so, I contacted the seller and still no response. I tried over 20 times with no success. Amazon made 3 mistakes in 3 days and they got away with it. Amazon became the weak link in my business so, I had no hesitation in dealing with eBay. I would not recommend anyone to deal with Amazon. ",0

"this company sank to a disgusting low. deceptive company practices, absolutely horrendous customer support. i would like to mention that i remember a time when amazon had some of the best customer support you'd find. that is far from the case now. no point at all contacting their support. if you have any issues just return your item, and try not to purchase it on amazon to begin with",0

Really great company,2
"Amazon is a very decent assistance, however I can find nowhere to report a discrepancy between the comment the order driver made and the actuality! The comment read “handed to resident”. Not so, we were in and listening for the order - having tracked it. But no ringing of the bell or knocking of the door, just dumped.I’ve tried to find a place on their web site to report this - it’s not the first time - to no avail!! Sad really as parcels they send by Royal Mail or other assistance always come with a ring or knock!! Making this a reliably, safe order. That’s really is my only complaint about an otherwise very decent company!",1
"Terrible delivery, down for 1430-1630never arrived. Rescheduled for up to 10pm yet driver per Amazon tracker passed within 0.5miles my address twice before heading off elsewhere. Rechecked at 2000hrs driver been sat at costa coffee for 1.5hrs. 2100hrs still no delivery.Called customer service who although polute couldnt or wouldnt help resolve when delivery would take place. No contact with driver available no map tracker update available per service representative. Thoroughly dissatisfied at the professionalism of this company. As a courier man myself you dont send a driver with hundreds of pounds worth of parcels out and have no way of contacting them. Pathetic excuses.......",0
"Can't rate them lower since they started censorship. SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON !!!",0
amazon is a great website and i got al of my things on time and have never had a problem,2
Normally they are okay but ther seller account is a joke. I got charged 19p for I dont know what and just using it is a pain.,1
Been a prime member for years now and I can’t really say anything bad about the service they offer for such a small monthly subscription. I recently purchased from them and the delivery was the same day and that was a shock given how long you wait compared to other company’s. Any problems Ive had with orders which are very rare and have alway been resolved in a very timely manner.,2
"Amazing full stop. Amazing prices, amazing shipping time, amazing support services, amazing site, amazing products..........",2
"Despite returning two items, Amazon has claimed that they only received one and deducted the amount from my account without telling me first that they claimed they only received one. This is untrue and a sign of an incompetent organization. I think I will be shopping on ebay in future.",0
ordered a stapler and it was supposed to come with a set of staples - the stapler arrived without the staples so not much use really,1
I shouldn’t take 3 days to prepare a order to ship I’ve never seen such a slow an a business that don’t care about there customers time to step up a few levels Amazon an customer service.,0
"The worst customer service…. Tried to change my phone number on my account the first rep told me they don’t have my email as an account, and I told him I receive emails about my orders all the time and then he verified my address only to hang up on me. The next rep told me she’d send an email to me to show my license and it’ll take 48 hours… the email eas never sent to me",0
"Let me down few time but overall great, especially prime deliveries next day or sometimes even same day before 10pm.",2
"I placed an order on Amazon and I did not receive the item. The reps via chat were incredibly rude and unhelpful regarding refund assistance. Two of the reps ended the chat in the is mist of the conversation (how rude), the 3rd rep stated he would follow up via email and that never happened. The 4th rep issued me a refund and the 5th rep canceled my refund without my authorization. Overall it was a shady hot mess!  My last few transactions with Amazon have been very poor. Items have arrived defective, sent to the wrong address, I have received ""knock off"" versions, etc. The quality in their products have rapidly declined. The worst sellers to purchase from are the 3rd party vendors, buyer beware. Amazon sucks!",0

"I appreciate the scale of what Amazon has achieved, and understand that it has single handedly within a period of only a few years turned the human race into an over-expectant, self-centered and impatient lot, but the fact that there is no way at all to speak to someone in customer service to simply ask why a late delivery has been marked as failed delivery without any attempt to deliver it is just beyond frustrating! Like most people, we have become reliant on Amazon for their super quick deliveries of last minute items. Sadly, we now seem to have little to no option to go elsewhere.....",0
"Absolutely unbelievably bad service! I have ordered things from Amazon waisted time and money , just for ups to deliberately deliver this parcel to someone else and sign for it (so somebody basically stolen my parcel and forge my signature) then when I call ups they refused to get in contact with driver directly and ask him where he delivered this parcel (since they have log in system and exactly can identify the responsible driver) ! So from that you can draw only one simple conclusion, that they are bunch of thieves and nothing else . Their solution was basically to go through some claim process instead of contacting the drive claiming process that is completely broken and takes like hour to go through it ! Such behaviour to your customers who paid is completely unacceptable and appalling ! Amazon why you even using 3rd parties to deliver",0

Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
"I buy almost everything through Amazon, it's so convenient when you're a Prime Member. Gotta love them for that! The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer assistance rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer assistance who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day. For an e-commerce company that deals with so many items, they did not a very fine job at properly packaging the glass items. Very disappointing!",1
Don't know why anyone could give less than 5 stars as since my husband passed away in February l have shopped more than usual with them and if not in items always left in my secure place.,2
"This organization is a joke. I happily cancel my Prime Membership today. I moved recently; and ordered items on Amazon for my new place. Cymax (seller on Amazon) shipped my items 5 days after charging my card. My husband had to reach out to them to have the items delivered. I finally received my order and the item is the wrong color. I reached out to the seller and Amazon. They approved my return; however, I'm responsible for shipping. I told the seller to pick it up. Now, Cymax wants me to take photos and email them. I can't find their email address online, you can't attach photos online through Amazon, and Cymax isn't taking calls due to this pandemic. I emailed Cymax (Amazon receives a copy) through Amazon app asking for the email. Neither organization responds.Amazon lost my lamps I ordered over a week ago. I asked for a replacement and that'll be another 10 days at a minimum. I asked for refund. I was told that it will take 7-10 business days per Amazon's new policy. A rep told me that I can have a refund for my Prime membership for the month. Her manager said I can't because I received free shipping. Free shipping doesn't matter because 2 items were lost; and I received something I didn't order. 2 reps told me I need to be patient. I'm not receiving a discount though Amazon can't be responsible for their end of the deal. Amazon doesn't know where my items are.",0

can't get enough! its amaz(on)ing!,2

I requested an invitation to buy and I have not been sent a link yet. It’s been more than a month…,1
Excellent service provider.,2
We as a family love Amazon.Anything you want is there.A quick and easy way to shop.The prices are excellent and of course the choice of goods.My favourite gift I received for Christmas this year was a £50 Amazon gift voucher.I was in heaven.,2
"Very long history with amazon, bought an item which passed the estimated delivery date, ordered the item on 25th January 2020, estimated delivery date 21st February 2020, today is 22/02/20 item not yet delivered.Contacted Amazon, instead of apologising and refunding me, I was informed that I have to wait for 3 more working days, whilst Amazon debited my account 26th January, no item no money and I am being told to wait, who will pay interest on that money.Very very very poor customer service, the managers are not well trained, the staff are not well trained.",0
Best for goods delivery and transportation ,2
Fantastic website and items and customer sercice!!!,2
"Whilst Amazon seem to deliver books ok, they failed to deliver a bottle of wine, their customer service website is dire and keeps taking you round in complete circles, I have now cancelled the order but there was no opportunity to speak to anyone and when on screen they said they were phoning me that was a complete lie, the phone never rang despite several attempts, Their customer service is just an utter waste of  space",0
"This is simply the worst company I've dealt with. Delivery was messed up and I spent hour on the phone to them, I was promised so many times a solution and compensation and it didn't happen. They hung up on me several times and kept telling me lies. I am lost for words, they are arrogant people who don't care about the customer.",0
"WHY YOU DON'T FIRED THIS GUYS WORKING FOR AMAZON !!!!????   I enjoyed buying things from Amazon, but now , no more. I'm even afraid to make more orders , because they still the packages after they take de picture and lately they delivered my orders to the other neighbors door. After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1

Not much else to say. Amazon has everything you want and it arrives in only 1 or 2 days.,2
Never had any problem with anything bought from Amazon.Dont even bother with the express delivery as most items delivered within a couple of days.,2
Told me if i ordered the product now I would get it by tomorrow. Paid and email came out saying delivery saturday 28th.. what a con. RONALDO customer service manage wasnt any help. He is a nugget,0
"next day delivery, plethora of products, free amazon prime... what's there not to like?",2
"Amazon has been slipping for a while. Their shipping has been getting longer and longer. They will tell you at check out when the item(s) will be delivered and the item(s) arrive a week later. Being a Prime member at one time had benefits, now its becoming a nice cash cow for Amazon without providing what was, top notch assistance and shipment. One day, about 4 years ago, I orderd an item from Amazon and it actually arrived the same day! I was sold on Amazon, now I can take 20 minutes of my time and go to Walmart, pay less and have the item in my hand when i leave the store. This is what happens when a company get too big for itself.",1
"Is a great company for shopping online never had a bad experience. My items always arrived on time. My items has been exactly what I ordered, and they have great prices",2
"Literally the worst shopping experience I've had online. Account was closed for suspicious activity. Customer service is a joke, you'll get 15 different answers no one knows what's going on. You need to talk to an unreachable account specialist to get your account reinstated. Do not shop here. I lost two weeks of my life I'll never get back. Nevermind the $50 balance on my account that I'll apparently forfeit. I genuinely hope you all die a slow and painful death",0
Customer service has sadly been degrading steadily by the day.,0
"I've been a prime member like forever. This past year, numerous orders have taken a week or longer, when said to be delivered within 2-3 days. Some I was able to cancel, others could not be cancelled. Also, more and more packages are damaged or torn open. I even received one order (vitamins) where the envelope was EMPTY and looked like it was never sealed. It's been pretty aggravating...",1
best place to find your items.,2
I dont want to make it long but they sent my order late. I wasn't expecting amazon does this,1
The item arrive within 3 business day.  they even give me a tracking number.,2
"Amazon has been pretty helpful for most occasions. Sometimes their third world customer service associates have difficulty understand what I am trying to explain in email, but they do try their best to guide me on what I need to do. Refunds are easily dealt with if you purchase directly from Amazon, make sure you read return policies for third party sellers using Amazon as a platform.",2

"I've been shopping at Amazon for quite a while now and they are one of my go-to places online. I usually shop here when the things I'm looking for aren't available locally or when they have the item(s) at a lower price than local sellers.I have lost parcels before (God damn porch pirates) throughout the years, and (their) customer service was always swift at either sending me a replacement for stolen delivery or payment refund - and they got these transactions done for me within 5 business days.I rarely purchase from 3rd party merchants on Amazon but when I did, I made sure the sellers have very high rating and trusted by people who have purchased from them. Otherwise, I usually purchase straight from Amazon's warehouse goods.No complaints here; 5/5",2
"Electronics dvd, cds & music..... AMAZON.COM all the way...YES!!!!!",2
I love shopping in Amazon.,2
For a long time Amazon was number one with me. I have been a prime member for years. Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer assistance has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,1
"Please be aware that Amazon trade in service is a scam! Amazon condone their scam and won't help. I sent a complete Xbox, all accessories and in perfect condition and working order. They halved the amount promised saying that I didn't send all accessories (why would I keep them???) And that the console was damaged. They could not send me pictures of said damage nor tell me what was missing. I'm furious.",0
"FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE 🇵🇸🇵🇸",0
Great experience of shopping with this app..Their customer care is very helpful and supportive..,2
"I love the Alexa devices, I really do!",2
The experience has always been great and I've never been disappointed with the orders that Amazon delivers themselves... here in a few days!,2
Just about the worst customer serviceNo wonder their stock is falling..Rude Rude customer service...most can hardly speak English..all you get is headaches from repeating yourself...,0
"I am absolutely infuriated with how the service with Amazon is getting worse and worse. This is the 5th time my parcel is stated having been passed to resident but actually is lying dumped on the pavement outside my front door!! Not only has this happened 5 times where my parcel is actually there when I get home but because of this bad service, I have also had 3 parcels stolen. Even when I'm in the house, I have watched them dump the parcels, knock on the door and immediately dissappear and in these cases the comment has then stated, handed to resident! It's unacceptable and needs to change!",0

I requested an invitation to buy and I have not been sent a link yet. It’s been more than a month…,1
I just don’t like about amazon is the customer cares just one thing. Always when the Usps fails on the day they supposed to deliver and they don’t. Why in the world like a customer do I have to call and fix it ? I’m paying for the support . They have to contact the postal office and fix it . That is why I’m paying for that support btw is not cheap . “Amazon prime”  I hope they can do something about it,1
"I am a faithful customer of Amazon recently I've had two small situations that I needed Amazon to intervene. I will say that when I reached out to Amazon they were very thoughtful, very timely, very professional, they listened to make sure that my issues were resolved. I'm very grateful which will make me continue to want to shop with Amazon in the near future😊",2
"Very good.Ordered on Monday, received on Wednesday.",2
"Personally never had a problem with Amazon.  Can usually find whatever I want to buy, at a reasonable price, with fast and reliable delivery… And the site is easy to navigate and use…",2
if theres lower than one star ill give them . we need a competitor seriously,0
"I order alot from Amazon. One thing I do not like is when my order is delivered they do not ring the door bell. I live in a semi ordinary neighborhood and in apartments. I do not know why they can literally walk right up here set my package at my door, take a picture of it but not ring the bell. Every time. I only had 2 people ring the bell out of 30-40 orders. It just tells me the company does not care if you get your order or not. They only want to make a sell and protect themselves.",1
I have used amazon for years & have only had positive expirences with them.,2
"The worst customer service…. Tried to change my phone number on my account the first rep told me they don’t have my email as an account, and I told him I receive emails about my orders all the time and then he verified my address only to hang up on me. The next rep told me she’d send an email to me to show my license and it’ll take 48 hours… the email eas never sent to me",0
Pathetic service. All they do is deal with fake sellers and who don’t deliver the products as promosed. Just give you a run around for refund. They don’t stick to their policy. It’s been month i have been facing issue with my order and no one is ready to take the responsibility! They keep harrasing their customers ! Terrible customer service ever!,0
"I use Amazon a lot. If a package is lost or extremely late I get a refund, and if it ends up arriving I still get to keep it. I do pay for prime but I'm thinking about stopping it because they keep trying to force me into a ""shipping day"" once a week. What's the point in paying for prime then because orders are free over $25(I think... It might be $50) I might as well add to cart until I have that amount.",2
So i have now been a prime member for over a year now and have to i love it so far life is so much easier with next day delivery. would recommend if your shopping on amazon to subscribe and enjoy the benefits not only with the fast delivery but also with the TV and music packages,2
"Good service overall, I have always get product if ordered in amazon, while on other sites my products tend to disappear i mail system.",2
"I ordered a patio umbrella on Aug. 1, 2021 on Amazon which I received. I have my credit card record showing the transaction. I needed to order a broken replacement part, only to discover there is no record of the purchase on Amazon itself in my order history so I contacted the company, Best Choice Products. They also had no record of my purchase. They can do nothing without my order ID number. I contacted Amazon Customer service chat online and repeatedly (3X) got what was obviously not a real person but an AI. I asked ""Are you a real person or an AI?"" and was told ""I am a real person"", but the responses were still like a programmed AI. I said, ""What is your favorite ice cream?"" because an AI would not be set up to respond. Sure enough, no answer. I wrote, ""I am not sure you are a real person so if you answer that question, I'll know."" The response: ""I am a real person"" which is the exact phrase that is always used. It's triggered by the phrase ""real person"". He refused to answer a simple question about ice cream so I knew it was an AI yet again. I finally gave up because it just kept going around in circles because its coding couldn't handle the complexity.  Shame on Amazon for lying to its customers that its customer service help are 'real people'.",0
I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
I placed an order w/Amazon and selected the 18 payment plan. Amazon charged the entire amount to my card. Called them and got no where. I was told it was the banks fault and I had to take it up with them.Buyer be ware!!!,0
Recently I ordered items based on the promise to deliver in two days being a Prime Member. However it has taken three days for the last three items to be delivered. One was promised next day order. It took two days.,1
I often find what I'm looking for is considerably cheaper when purchased via amazon.co.uk.,2

"I have no interest in signing up to Amazon Prime, When making a purchase, despite clicking the button not to sign me up, I could not stop Amazon from providing a 30 day free trial. I followed the instructions to remove the trial without success as the instructions took me to a page where there was no evident way to proceed with the cancellation. ",0

"I order a lot of books for my business. I love to shop on Amazon because I can find the books I need and search by price, so that I can find the book at rock bottom prices. I also find it extremely helpful that Amazon includes pretty extensive details about the book, such as the number of pages, a description, all of the sellers that offer the book (new and used), and even supplies reviews from users like me, all on one page.",2
The absolute worst. They have forgotten that the biggest retailers stand because of the power of the consumer. Falsifying delivery is not the way to go. Especially when they are quick to debit your credit card. Automated chats and voice calls are an insult to the consumer. Gladly taking my business elsewhere.,0
Worst shipment assistance ever!! Three times special instructions were submitted and they STILL get it wrong.It's no wonder stuff is stolen off porches all the time.,1
"I really enjoy using Amazon for online shopping but the order drivers do NOT make the usage worth it. They are a disappointment almost every time & I barely get my packages from them when they come to my house! They will leave my house with the package while I'm home due to them not reading the order instructions. Which are very simple instructuons. It's not even worth the hassel any more & thinking about cancelling my prime. They have excellent costumer support, but it's becoming a waste of money because of the driver's. So so sad",1
Customer support is amazing and the products are great quality!,2
"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music assistance, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new assistance at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new assistance at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
Sexist delivery driver that wont deliver to a woman and no my order cant seem to get delivered. I want to cancel prime over this and they refuse. Gready without a care to their customers. Disgusted by amazon,0
Utterly appauling experience with Amazon and as such have emailed their UK CEO and may relay to Trading Standards/their regulator. Amazon Prime Membership default unless deleted is yet another issue that is most annoying and needs deleting. ,0
"Long time Prime Member.They raise the membership fee by a lot and take away 2 day shipping gurantee. I just bought something that is coming from Amazon and it's going to take a week.  The quality of goodss has dropped. If I search for ""Asus"" why is the first page filled with your ""sponsored"" stuff that is not what I searched for? And most of it is Temu garbage.   I think it's time we start shopping around more...",1
"Delayed order , Classic Amazon smh...",1
"It used to be that if I purchase more than $35, it usually was Free Shipping.  Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1
I love the kindle and cant wait for the new version!!!!,2
Time and time again Amazon stands out,2
"This has now happened twice. Bought some items via Amazon. An item breaks or is no good, so I return the item and get a refund. A few weeks later, Amazon then debits my card again for the item which has been returned! When I last phoned to kick off - I was told that the wrong return postage sticker had been attached - which is funny because guess who supplies the returns post stickers? You got it - Amazon! In other words, the excuse offered was complete B/S. Amazon staff are trying to get away with sticking through fraudulent bills/debits! Make sure you check your bank/card statements very carefully!",0
Items from Amazon have always been great and on time. My review is for Amazon not sellers using Amazon platform,2

"I purchased an android 5G capable phone, on startup it took over an hour to complete, storage was 30% used - 70% available. It never recognized my fingerprint to unlock apps, and ran slower than my 3G android. I inquired a better refund explaining that I am mobile impaired. They insisted that I needed to bring it to the post office and send it that there was no way to have it picked up. Discontent but still agreeing I ordered a new phone upon its arrival I began to switch insensitive apps to the new phone and everything appeared to be fine I searched the internet so that I could probably factory reset the other phone to clear my data. I then began to reenter passwords and log into accounts and verify the IP address to the new device when I noticed that I didn't have administration rights on the new device because it hadn't completely wiped the old device and fragments of the applications remained. Which meant I needed to reboot the First new phone that I got so the IP address would register in the applications and I could make the transfer from within. After 4 hours of watching the screen turn and turn and tell me downloading and updating I powered off and put the phone away and try it again in a few hours. Extremely frustrated I called Amazon customer service back again today and made it very clear that they need to do something because I have to bring that phone now to a technician to have him go into the hard drive and extract my data. This is going to cost more than the phone is worth and Amazon refuses to do anything. I will happily return the phone but somebody needs to come and get it. It's winter time in Quebec I am mobile impaired how in the world do they expect me to get to a post office",0
"I cannot count how many times they've offered next day order and every time I've ordered within the time frame and with a purchase amount to meet the ""requirements"" and not once has any of it been delivered next day. Not once. Do not fall for it. And it appears some of their drivers are either illiterate or just lazy or both. I order all the time from Amazon because it is convenient but Temu offers much better deals and even though the shipping takes longer, they don't lie about that and you get a credit if it's late.",1
"Prime or standard parcels either don't arrive, are late or delivery options are not followed. Consistently disappointed with the service provided. Options for customer services do not include enough options and its hard to actually speak to a person to resolve issues. Very fed up! However not quite as bad as ebay at this point!",0
"As for me, it's only one minus: I live in the Czech Republic, but Czech Amazon doesn't exist. It means, that I have additional spendings for delivery of Amazon parcels from Germany, UK, USA. And particularly for me not easy to buy on Amazon.de as I don't speak German.Beside it I haven't got any problem with Amazon.",2
"Decent company has a wide variety of goodss as you would expect from Amazon. The customer support is slowly becoming better and better. I like shopping with Amazon as it is quick and reliable and I can always get a refund if needed. However I think there are some areas that could be improved, for example, the way they treat their staff and handle fines",1
"Don’t ever use Amazon.es! Faulty items that Amazon does not want to take responsibility for even though it was Amazon that sold and delivered it. I bought some baby items well in time for the baby’s arrival. I had a quick look to see if everything was there and it looked fine but obviously didn’t put it up including a travel cot/changer as I wasn’t due any time at that point, I got it early just in case as you never know when the baby decides to come. When I did get to put it all up, there was a clip missing to hold the changer up safely onto the cot, this is something I would t know was missing without the whole thing up and reading instructions etc. I contacted Amazon and they shrugged it off saying the policy is complain within 30 days. This isn’t realistic for this sinario but they didn’t want to know. I only wanted the missing item! I didn’t want a refund or a return, I just wanted the clip which I am unable to buy separately. They didn’t care and didn’t want to know!! It’s so black and white with Amazon and will use anything to avoid responsibility and to compensate a faulty item! I might as well paid a lot less for the same item as I am unable to use the other aspects. It’s now just a travel cot. I paid €110 for a travel cot!!! Don’t bother! Go to a shop or use a different online sight!",0

I said that “I ordered an item the 1st part of July and after 3 weeks I contacted the seller to say it hadn’t been received and was told it was shipped, but never got any other communication  from the seller after that.”  Amazon said I couldn’t post a review like that.  I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.",1
I have been an Amazon customer for several years.  In the past I have been extremely happy with this service. Recently some the products that I purchased were unusable and had to be returned or of a lower quality than I expected.  I hope that the quality of the products improves.,2

"Today was a prime deal day!!! Been looking for videos about a CosmoGrill Outdoor XL Smoker Barbecue Charcoal Portable BBQ Grill Garden... was reduced to £139.99... I'm very upset, that at 22:50pm, UK time, which still part of the same day ( 11/07/2023), the promotion was already gone, and the price went up £30 to £169.99.....Forty minutes later, price went back to £139.99, but only give me option of adding to the basket, no way we can buy this item, unless we buy at normal price of £169.99. This morning Was trying to buy purina cat dry food, the same issue, unable to buy, but is showing on my basket... This is fake advertising...

"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative interaction with Amazon customer assistance over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a order date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer assistance to get a more specific order date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in order. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended interaction with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
"AMAZON is great. One thing missing from AMAZON is their inability to promote books posted or published on their websites. I believe that this type of outlet should develop a format to introduce new entries to their published list, and to maintain such rooster continually for up to 90 days after posting of a new book title, (even at a small cost to the authors is acceptable). Doing so, does not translate to an endorsement of a book, rather informative to the audiences worldwide. The AMAZON prominence position them to champion this option. Because the idea of listing a book title on their portal, without publicity, is like planting a flower without intention to add water for germination. Development of ""AMAZON BookTV"" where such is platformed is no a average idea considering the corporate standard.",1
Deliveries are amazingly extremely slow. I live 5 minutes from there location in my town and yet I have to wait all day long for a package and most of the time it’s delivered to the wrong address.

"Constant bait and switch on Amazon fresh. They figure out what items you actually want, refuse to let you actually buy them, and then Jack the price by 50% to 100% when you add them back to your cart again.",0
"I've never had a problem with Amazon, I buy stuff pretty frequently and it's always what I expect. To the people saying they got scammed: there are websites I use such as fakespot.com and reviewmeta.com that can tell you if the reviews may be fake, it definitely helps you spot the sellers that could scam you",2
A very high quality service which over the past years has provided me with top quality items at very low prices and the customer service they provide for looking after their customers is excellent.,2
"A so-so usage, the shipper never called me when they didn't meet me so many times they dropped the package outside the door, never cared that the properties inside are expensive or not.",1
Amazon is the worst scamming company there is our there they have scam artists working from inside the parcels never show up on time .They treat their dsp 3rd party driver's like crap like their disposable always trying to get free deliveries out of us they hurt their driver's and put them in dangerous positions and push things to the limit. This company needs to be shut down,0
"I live in a small town in Washington state, this morning I order some items  off of Amazon, and tonight they arrived. This is so impressive to me. I was able to sit in the comfort of my own home, make a purchased and have it delivered the very same day. Everyone at Amazon is a hero to me, they operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Thank you to all of the employees world wide to make those of us at home lives better. Amazon is not a perfect company, but we don’t live in a perfect world. They are doing a great job! Their drivers are friendly and professional. I hope Amazon realizes how great their employees are and what a value they are to their company. They are the face of the company. Store fronts, drivers, pilots…they are making Amazon great! Be kind and appreciate this home delivery service!",2
"Have been a Amazon Prime member for 2 years. It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the order trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get items replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students. I still love Amazon Products but don't know if they are worth the shipping hassle. Questioning Prime Membership. (Netflix for Movies  is better)",1
"Used To Be Excellent.I have been with Amazon and Amazon Prime for over a decade and they have been excellent in every way a few hitches but it’s to be expected and was dealt with .The last couple of years the assistance has got steadily worse , prices are in some cases ( majority) very much higher , I recently return ed items which basically were not fit for purpose and received from Amazon an email threatening to close my account for returning to much but if you send me clearly used acceptables or acceptables which are not as shown I shall return them but Amazon are not interested, the deliveries are acceptable on the whole but had things throw over fences dumped on car bonnet .. I have cctv so know when the driver lies .Prime is not really worth it as a lot of the films are just really cheap budgeted movies you wouldn’t watch anyway . After the last email threatening to close a very active account I am thinking now to take the lead and pull the plug on Amazon.Once they were excellent but I think they have now grown to big and offer very poor value for money",1
Since you don't care about free speech for everyone and since you want monopolize everything you can kiss my &$$! I don't need you! All you want is to push democrat rhetoric and suppress any others that don't agree with you. You are the fascist!,0
They helped me a few times so I didn't give them 1 star. But could be a lot better.,1
"I've been shopping at Amazon for quite a while now and they are one of my go-to places online. I usually shop here when the things I'm looking for aren't available locally or when they have the item(s) at a lower price than local sellers.I have lost parcels before (God damn porch pirates) throughout the years, and (their) customer service was always swift at either sending me a replacement for stolen delivery or payment refund - and they got these transactions done for me within 5 business days.I rarely purchase from 3rd party merchants on Amazon but when I did, I made sure the sellers have very high rating and trusted by people who have purchased from them. Otherwise, I usually purchase straight from Amazon's warehouse goods.No complaints here; 5/5",2
VERY HAPPY WITH ALL SERVICES  FROM AMAZON,2

Because I contacted the vendor a second time asking where is my item Amazon says I have to wait 48 hours for a response before they can do anything. Doesn’t matter I already contacted the vendor once before. They don't care that my money is gone and the goods is way over due.Amazon may contact the vendor, maybe file an A to Z complaint and another month goes by and Amazon has my money. I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen. Amazon could have read the complaints from all the other people who have not gotten the goods, but chose not to.Amazon has removed this item from their site like the other 2 items I had the same issue with.I told Amazon I would file a dispute with my bank and they said, go ahead file a dispute with you bank.This is the third time something like this has happened. What has happened to customer assistance? What happened to Amazon backs their items? Why is Amazon taking customer money so quickly for items before they are shipped? Do they not trust their third party vendors? Amazon is",1
Forget these clowns.  If you change your contact number it’s impossible tochange it nor contact them to change it to the new number.  I can log into my account but code verification goes back to the old contact number.  Send the code to the email. Bunch of halfwits.,0
I'm sick and tired of my Amazon purchases being left on the pavement outside my house.No they haven't been handed to resident.....they've been dumped outside in the rain.,2
"I'm always satisfied with the service, and the support team rocks!On 30+ purchases i've been disappointed just 2/3 times, and the problems where caused by sellers or courier",2
"Very very bad.since this exprience preffer use Ebay.they are much better than amazon if anything happend.I ordered a camera with the case via amazon and in the package was only case.somebody stolen the camera,wrote this to amazon.also reported a crime at police,and no help at all,amazon stopped answer me an polices argument was not enough proofs,If that happened with ebay,what did to me once.their service was amazing,refunded me what the lost.",0
I can find everything I need on Amazon from live movies to great priced books!,2
"Amazon is an outstanding website to purchase a few things online. However, I have issues with delivery. My experience with the delivery is bad. I noticed that I am not the only one who has issues with delivery in my apartment. Some of the residents in the apartment have experienced the same issue. When Item is delivered, they update amazon where the package is left. Therefore, it is delivered with misinformation about the exact location of the package because the package actually was placed outside of the apartment where an individual somehow stole my package. I could not confirm whether it is a false delivery or the package is actually stolen... I had to report it and I requested a refund. Amazon is very hesitant about refunding or replacement. Nowadays, I can not trust amazon with delivery. I start to feel anxious that they will misinform me about where my package was actually placed.",0
"Three times my items have not been delivered/ the service I have paid for has not been fulfilled and each time the customer service team are just equipped to antagonise and argue with me. Fobbing me off with bold face lies. Each time saying they will assure it won’t happen again… this is three times in a month?! The managers are worse than the agents. Antagonistic and rude. An absolute disgrace and so disgusting how they treat their loyal customers, causing harm to their mental health. Disgraceful.",0
"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and they are great at delivering for free and returns for free. But they have a big problem with their search app.I searched on 10 foot soaker hose and I pressed the Prime button so I wouldn't see non prime stuff. And I got a list that included regular hoses, a bed for the bedroom and lots of other stuff that had nothing to do with hoses. And there were non-prime items in the list and the same item is listed several times. This is normal now with all my searches. And unless I am very focused, I might buy the wrong item. And then I have to go thru the hassle of returning it.",1
Many of the venders are selling their goodss for more than you can purchase them from the manufacturer or other outlets like Walmart. Some of the sales look more like gouging.,1
"This company needs to go back to selling online books the lie they cheat they steal I’m a customer and used to be Amazon seller they charge you so much money it’s hard to make a profit they claim to refund customers and don’t but take the money from your sellers account and then the customer is chasing you thinking you haven’t given the money back and you have the delivery drivers coming to deliver parcels and they don’t this company to scam sellers and customers. Hence the reason why Amazon is a billionaire is become a billionaire by scamming people as they say, scammers usually hide behind doors, but Amazon, he’s a scammer that hides in plain sight we need to go back to supporting small business and boycott Amazon",0
Never had any issues amazon prime acceptable for.next day order not really using amazon as much as i used to as i feel there prices are getting quite expensive used to use them for my tropical fish filter sponge and stones but its an add on item now meaning i have to spend something like £20 to get something at £3 meaning i now have to travel 25 miles to our nearest wilko for them. The pantry also a rip off order dearer than actual items.,1
Told me if i ordered the product now I would get it by tomorrow. Paid and email came out saying delivery saturday 28th.. what a con. RONALDO customer service manage wasnt any help. He is a nugget,0
Really great services for products which is not available in local markets.,2
IF I COULD SEND SCREENSHOTS I WOULD CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE RUDEST BUNCH OF PEOPLE EVER I TOLD THEM ABOUT MY SITUATION AND THEY TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO RESPOND AND WHEN I CONTINUED TALKING THEY RUDLEY ENDED THE CHAT IF IM PAYING FOR MY ITEMS ID LIKE THEM TO ARRIVE.,0
"After many years a loyal Customer it has now come to the point had enough of poor customer assistance.Ordering and order is excellent,but anything goes wrong with a appliance after thirty days it’s a uphill battle.Remember your contract is with Amazon ,not the manufacturer,but Amazon keep telling its not there problem.If it’s a third party ,then just give up as Amazon are not interested.There’s no way to complain , all emails that used to work bounce ,the agents won’t let you complain.So as soon as my refund that I’ve been waiting for 5 week arrives , if it ever does ,I’m closing my account.",1
I have ordered numerous counterfeit items off Amazon in the last couple months. I also noticed my spa chemicals no longer work. I had to empty tub 2 times in 6 weeks. Frog chemicals now show up with clear tape on them. I’m sure they will say so it doesn’t leak but they used to last 6 weeks and do a good job now they last 3 weeks at most and tub turns green. I have not changed any products and spa is not even 2 yrs old. What are they putting in there . I also only see 4 and 5 star reviews on ever post except this page I had to search for. Amazon is selling counterfeit items and who knows what’s in my chemicals,0
"I don't understand why this has so many bad reviews, its epic hard to break and i think amazon is pretty good",2
I have been an almost daily customer of Amazon.Com for about three years now! I have bought everything from underwear to camera equipment to Greek Orthodox Easter bread to hard to find theological books on Amazon.Com.  You can get super fast shipping by signing up for Amazon.Prime and you'll save a TON of money on shipping.  I have come to trust Amazon.Com to provide the lowest prices anywhere--even better than those of clubs like Books A Million Discount Cards.   The variety and choices are great.  Even their third party vendors provide wonderful service.  Amazon.Com is certainly where it is at! Returns are also a snap!,2
"Order an item said delivered, nowhere to be found. Had to order it again as can’t get a refund for 5 days so had to pay again. Then driver parks outside house never delivers it. Later that day unable to deliver, it’s been 3 days and still waiting for item and have lots all this time.",0
"I have used Amazon for many years and overall, have always been pleased with the results. Quality is generally very good and I keep the products that I buy. I love the included 2-day shipping with Prime, as well as other benefits such as Prime video. I also like how easy it is to return a product - just drop it off at your local kohls and you're set - boom, super easy! With that said, Amazon is not perfect. When I've needed to get a hold of customer support, they have been very helpful, however, it's not always clear as to how to get a hold of someone. I will also say, Amazon does have a significant issue with allowing knock-offs to run rampant on their site. You can tell the copycats and knock-offs apart if you know how to look, but it is misleading and hurts legitimate, honest business owners.",2
Amazon is getting more and more expensive I'm starting to find stuff locally and almost half price used to order a lot from Amazon but lately local has been cheaper,1
The delivery driver left the parcel at our front door whilst we were out but claimed to hand it to the customer. captured on security camera. Our front door is 3 feet away from the main pavement. Unable to report it to Amazon. If it had been stolen we would have no proof and unable to get a refund.,0
Ever since they decided my reviews are somehow in violation of their policy. Seriously I'm an old hippie and I didn't break there stupid rules.  Since then my service has sucked. It's very rarely I get a product any where near the time promised sometimes 2 months ago I canceled a few orders. They promised delivery by a certain time then 2 days goes by and all of a sudden you aren't getting anything for 2  weeks or more. Once they steal your ability to review a product is as if no one cares at all if your happy anymore. I'm an old lady that never profited off my reviews just trying to help others with my experiences. I'm no longer going to Amazon first.  I have way more options than I originally thought and I'm getting products quicker and in better shape as well. I am most likely going to cancel. Feeling like a second class citizen with no voting rights.,0
"Another rip off from Amazon, music at expensive extra cost. I’ll go elsewhere what’s the point of prime, I used music a lot but now another charge.",0
"Amazon make it easy to buy online, watch films, read books and listen to music and their Prime Days are brilliant!",2
I have used Amazon several times and always find the service easy and efficient. Wrapping can sometimes be over generous.,2
I ordered this eyelash serum which helped me to grow my eyelashes a little. It came pretty quickly and the seller was very helpful when deciding which product to choose.,2
I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day order and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1
"Amazon delivery is ineffective. nothing has been done to correct the issue for deliveries being made contrary to the delivery instructions in my profile. Four out of five (now) deliveries are being made incorrectly. Contacting Amazon and reporting this is a waste of time. I did it yesterday, and again today. No effect. Deliveries still made incorrectly.No other option has been presented.This ineptitude has caused me to stop using this service and company",0
I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer assistance levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the assistance on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
"Would give 0 if I could. You don't censor me.  Cancelled prime, and will never again order anything thru amazon.  You are communist pigs",0
I was selling products on Amazon and had a guy that was not a customer and had never bought the product I sold (I know this because I am the only person who makes or sells the product) give a negative review on 2 of my products for IDK what reason. I contacted amazon over 6 times trying to get this matter taken care of and they where NO help. I removed my listing and I am going to stick to selling on ebay.,0
"My experience with Amazon has usually been good, with one obvious exception.  When I order something that is shipped and delivered by Amazon, it's always a disaster.  Additionally, their customer service now seems to be non existent.  Getting lost orders replaced is a headache and they'll manage to ship a replacement after you jump through their hoops.  But it will take a week or more for them to ship it.",0
"Prime ..I agree with other posters here and other sites. Prime is no longer the 'next day delivery' promised. In fact paying Prime is now rip off becaue deliveries are the same without paying for it. In effect its a wste of money.Prime offers other  benefits --so they say . Music .. theres a rotten selection and only there to force you into subscribing to their millions of songs library . Its cheaper and better to get Spotify and forget Amazon music altogether.  During this year the music selection has been reduced continually . Now its useless. Asking for a song gets the generic response 'Heres a  station you might find if your lucky what you are lookng for '  Generally you dont . so thats another waste of time.Linking Spotify to the Echo account used to be easy . Now they make it difficult to force you into the poor Amazon Music.Amazon Prime Videos . another free benefit!!!   It offers nothing more than a few old movies . Far better is available elsewhere. Netfilx is FAR superior and at the same subcription price . Amazon is no competitor.Finally the Echo units 'age' and become deaf. I have 4 ... YES FOUR , in different continents and they all suffer from the same deafness problem. In my opinion its an inbuilt planned problem designed to make you buy another later version.  Dirty business practice.I wouldnt buy another echo..ever. I recommend you dont either.Nor would I subscribe to Prime. tyhose who have already done so would be well advised to review any benefit . They like me and others will conclude theres no value and cancel for refund",0
Great!!! They seem like good Christian people with good family values.God bless them and the U.S.A.They are making america great again!!!,2
"Bad delivery process I need the thing by today but it's not delivered and telling to wait for two days why I will wait i don't know whatever has happened , I need it by today or else .... Mark my words",0
"the worst company I never want to work for these types of people from Amazon again, after working for them you will notice that you are treated like a slave they have the worst, incompetent and arrogant staff all the id..ts at amazon are bosses they came for a year at amazon, maybe  don't even speak English very well and they have come to believe that they are superior and important, some messes",0
Non existing customer service. Been locked out of my account with no explanation. Still taking payment for prime membership and cant gain access to my item stored on amazon cloud.,0
I really disappointed with Amazon customer service regarding my refund . They credit my refund back to Amazon gift card not refund back to my original account without my consent.   Amazon company is the largest online company but the service is horrible and not even compare to Walmart customer service.  Walmart customer service is outstanding they solved all the customers concerns .  Whoever in charge the Amazon customer service department please train your employees don’t waste your customers time if you can’t solve any issues…Horrible service that I have to  experience! Especially customer service is oversea.  Your customer service is the worst.  “. Let me ask my manager and at the end you waste my time for an hour doing nothing.”,0
good company and quick delivery prime always gets my packages quickly delivered,2
"Amazon is a fine platform i buy so many things like charger, shirts, shoes but sometimes my usage is average sometimes my usage is to fine ",1
"I would give it 0 stars if possible. I paid for prime. Not 1 package came after i upgraded. ""Running late"" Shipment lost"". Then you just take it. Its like being bullied in school for your lunch money. So many other options to purchase online.  I would recommend anything else than these scam artists",0
"amazon customer service is so rude, I tried explaining to two different people on how I didn't receive my packages, they don't even listen or communicate and straight up end the call saying there is nothing else that can be done. I wasted 200 dollars just to not receive my packages TWICE and now I can't even get my money back?? Make this maks sense how is it my fault that my packages weren't delivered. I'm just trying to get my money back.",0
"Great support, but treat their employees poorly and not ethical.",1
"Ordered a waterproof jacket from r runvel through Amazon order dispatched, three days later I get a message out of stock no longer made. Tried to get a refund from Amazon, all I get is please return goods I never received.rip-off.r runvel another Chinese cr+p merchant.",0
"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
"I have purchased many things through Amazon over the course of several years. They carry hard-to-find merchandise, at reasonable prices. Frequently their prices beat what I can get locally as well. Customer service has always been excellent, and my products have almost always shipped immediately. The few times that I have been dissatisfied with what I received, exchanging the item was simple and hassle-free. Amazon.com has become my family's go-to source to get almost everything short of perishable groceries. (They do sell those, too...I just get them at my local grocer.) Especially like the wish list feature, so I know that I am getting someone something that they really want.",2
Been a bit delay recently but guess just near the Christmas.,1
"Amazon failed to deliver my item on time. Every time I call customer service representative tells me that the driver is almost at my door. Waited another 2 hours and cancelled the item. Will go and buy the same item at nearby Walgreens which is opened 24 hours At least no failed deliveries when you need something urgently, pay $1 more per tube but get a piece of mind. Thanks god we still have retail stores.",0
"I was their prime member for years and i cancelled it because i dont get stuff i ordered on time. Prime member should get their ordered item within 2 days, ok lets say its delayed for 4 days.. but they have delayed every item i ordered for more then a week and there is no compensations for that. We are paying prime member for fast shipment. I THINK THEY MAKE most MONEY FROM PRIME MEMBERSHIPS. Otherwise they are decent.",1
I am not sure who my delivery driver is but this person needs a raise!! I live in Janesville Ca. In a rural area. My driver always goes out of his way (I believe it’s “he”) today it was snowing and I was not home to take my boxes in. He neatly wrapped them in a plastic bag so that they would not get wet. My items are always neatly walked to my porch. He is the best amazon driver!! I hope this review can reach him!! Kudos!!,2
"They are ok for items you know cannot go wrong , however don’t buy electricals, they only offer 4 week guarantee and returning anything is a nightmare !! I am a regular customer but that counts for nothing ",0
"My package said delivered but it was nowhere to be found. This has happened before, which is extremely frustrating as I had left detailed instructions on where to leave the package. They were helpful in refunding me which was very kind, however, I think they need to have better communication with their shipping entities.",1
Review text not found,1
the buy and order is decent. but lately i reviewed some items that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing decent to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any ordinary words in my reviews,1
"They should get rid of Logistics for deliveries but they don’t do anything about it. I’ve been a prime member for years! I Was supposed to receive a package today but it was never out for delivery! Chatted with a Rachelle M which has terrible customer service by the way and she went and switched it to the next day delivery “per customer’s request” which I never requested! They lie and don’t even care!!!  Amazon Logistics is probably based on lazy people! One time I was waiting for my delivery and I was the next delivery however I noticed the driver turned the opposite way and minutes later, my delivery info was updated saying they could not deliver because package was damaged!!! My parcel was a rubber bath mat!!!!!!  Really????",0
Crappy company. Slow shipping. Over charging.,0
"I ordered an Amazon Fire stick. It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an shipment confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the shipment status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new shipment date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer support and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the fines never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too. Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund interaction. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.",1
"I wish a one star was possible. This is the third time amazon has taken unauthorised money from my account, and then said it does not show up in their system. I have emailed, after emailed, and the service is absolute trash, especially for stealing my money. What is this? A company? Or one for money laundering?Do your job. Don't steal money.",0
"Orders always come on time and most have no issues. When I did have one last year, the rep was so nice about it, gave me a refund on the spot! He completely understood where I was coming from, unlike Newegg who takes a good 2 weeks to process a refund, needs an investigations team for the whole thing ,etc. Not to mention the prime with a free 30 day trial! And yes I mean free, no having to buy an annual membership and then you get the trial after that. ( you know who im talking about)",2
"I have just recently started shopping online in Amazon. They are able to ship the deliveries on time when I purchase the items. But when I try to return a item that I incorrectly purchased, it still said pending item returned for a drop bar handle bike via Canada Post, it has been since June 24th that I have been waiting for the refund. According to the Canada Post site and tracking system, it said that it was returned and shipped to the Amazon warehouse, but on the Amazon tracking status it still says it is waiting for the item to be returned to it. What is your phone number or email as I tried finding the phone number for the site but had a hard time. Please help!!!",1
"shocking , full of deceit and liars. far from customer centric when it comes to speaking to a staff member. Try to speak logic with them and they wont understand so they will cut you off. They shouldnt have this much control within the market",0
Drivers kept leaving my parcel on door step whiles not at home and without me requesting a safe place alot of my parcels got stolen due to their drivers fault and instead of investigating they blocked my account permanently and blamed it on too many refunds instead of their drivers,0
I continue to be amazed at the quick service! Placed an order an hour ago and all items will be delivered today. Blows my mind every time.,2
Right on for Amazon,2
Bought an ipad charger from amazon.. turns out its was a fake. Amazon has far too many counterfiet sellers now and doesnt seem to want to do anything about it. Will never buy from amazon again,0
"I buy as little as possible from Amazon, and I try to avoid the companies owned by Bezos.  I buy hardcover books from 'other' online sellers, however, sometimes Amazon is the only place to find a product at a 'fair' price.I'm writing this review because Amazon edited  a review of mine regarding Hikari LED headlights.  I gave the Hikari a single star because of the failure of 1 of the lights failing within 4 months of installation.  Amazon changed it to 2 stars and edited my rather short text, which was polite and straight forward.",0
"Totally different way of doing things from the selling, after sales, refunds and delivery - spot on fast and very professional. I must have dealt with them at least 30 times and every time delivery on time and 1 time i changed my mind on a purchase and the refund was back in my bank before i got home from the post office.

"We use Amazon quite a bit.  Having Prime is great, no worries about shipping, ability to borrow Kindle books and movies on the Kindle, and customer service is awesome.!",2
orders can end up anywhere but usually quick,1
"Find alot of items overpriced, claim to give you free shipment if you are an amazon prime member but actually it comes in the price of items. Will block you from reviewing their items without an explanation. Given 3 stars as they do deliver next day or when promised. some items can be awkward to return if not up to satisfaction.",1
"I placed an order to amazon, I received us an expected very satisfied more power!",2
"I previously reviewed Amazon for an order that I didn't receive,and was been told that I wouldn't receive a refund or my package. This is what happened. After submitting my review of disappointment in Amazon, I received emails explaining what company of Amazon will honor in my behalf. I received a very nice apology for my loss and did receive my money back. After all of this, Amazon did exhibit a support that it was beyond my expectations. For that, I am thankful. However don't take my word for it check it out for yourselves.",1
most sellers are not decent. But when you find a seller they provide decent stuff those are decent. add more quality control please!!,1
"I ordered an electric rototiller on a Sunday, it shipped and said I would receive it Friday, (so I could use it for the weekend)  Amazon said it shipped out, then the next day I got an email from Amazon saying the package is being returned because it's undeliverable.  What the heck?  Then I went to check the item and the price doubled.  I've been a customer for a long time, never an issue until this, what are they trying to pull here?  Now on top of the ordered being canceled I have to wait for a refund, and I won't be able to get a tiller befor the weekend, thanks a lot Amazon!!!!",0
Customer agents are all oversea,0
"on order time. When I order sometime for one day order I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
Will contunue to use in the future always a good service provided.,2
"Keeps charging me money even after several attempts to cancel my amazon video subscription. Only answer I get is ""sorry you're not in the system, we can't help you"" which sounds fishy cause they certainly have my credit card info...",0
"Can't fault Amazon for their super fast delivery and excellent customer service. Always kept up to date via email too. Bought hundreds of stuff in the last 2 years...and I often leave a feedback. Had issues with 2 sellers that I can recall, where products were either not as described and missing parts.  After contacting the seller(s) first, Amazon rightly refunded my monies promptly.  Stay as you are, Amazon.",2
"For years I've used them and It's really easy for consumers and sellers/scammers to use and often they don't issue refunds, hint's how the owner became richest person so proceed with caution.",1
"I have been a Prime member for years and was very pleased with Amazon.  Lately however, I have usaged several delayed orders, damaged shipments, and orders canceled due to lack of stock.  I am now purchasing more from other sites as I can't depend on Amazon.",1
"Used to LOVE Amazon but no longer a fan someone had gotten ahold of my Amazon prime information and keeps downloading movies n apps my CC has been hit for HUNDREDS of dollars in the last month there are about 4 charges I'm still waiting to be refunded and thank acceptableness the one I got hit for yesterday in the amount of $64 will be refunded. When asked what should I do to keep this from happening was first told to change my password did that went hm n was able to get right onto my prime without having to log in with new password next was told to remove CC did that but then started getting emails telling me to put one back on file or my acct will be closed...put a bogus one on then went in a WK later to place a order had to put my original cc back on to place my order less then a hour late more bogus charges on my acct. The CSRs don't speak proper English so IDT they understand what I'm asking when I say:"" what can I do to keep this from happening"" its getting really frustrating so I guess I'll jus be calling each time to get refunded when I have to put my original cc on file to place an order n get hit with charges I did not authorize. Can't wait until another company comes out similar...I will be RUNNING to them..",1
"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music assistance, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new assistance at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new assistance at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
Excellent thanks,1
The things I find on amazon always seem expensive to me,1
What Amazon is doing is to make money on your return by holding your money for 30 days or more.SHAM ON AMAZON,0
"Closed froze an account my friend had made in my name by mistake (we had a misunderstanding) when she trying to figure out where her items were (she didn’t even ask for a refund -just wanted her stuff!). They said it violated their terms of service.They never arrived and I ended up getting charged for them. I made my own account (thinking that one was deleted) and they closed it a few days after I ordered mask filters and was charged for Prime. I’m DONE with Amazon and anything to do with it, including Whole Foods. I was trying to do the right thing and to be a good customer (not using the account my friend had thought I wanted/she created in my name) but I guess they didn’t see that. This and for ethical reasons, I want nothing to do with them. I’ve heard that has happened to other people, too.",0
Most of the stuff I usually buy from amazon and I still do that but I really hate the way customer support works...because you have to explain your query to customer support from the beginning if you have to call them again...,1
So disappointed with Amazon. After all these years they never heard a peep from me until now. I purchased 4 black leggings that bled all over my white LV bag and the stains will not come out. All Amazon offered was to give me my money back and for me to keep the defective leggings and then said it was a courtesy! What about my bag that your product destroyed! They told me it wasn’t their problem. ,0
Prime is really great always getting deals and steals,2
Worst Service Ever had.Please don't use amazon service anymore,0
"WARNING:Just a word of warning.I've ordered lots of things from Amazon and only had 2 or 3 failures.  However, I feel that I should warn people that if your item is coming in from anywhere in the world, including Europe, customs randomly check items and if they are over just £18 in value, they levy a surcharge.  I've just been told that my item won't be released unless I pay £32.  The item itself was £52 and I paid £52 for delivery.  That means that costs have now exceeded the value of the goods.  Absolutely ridiculous.My options are to pay, or let the item be returned.  I have to add that I didn't buy this item off Amazon but when I told Parcelforce Coventry that I'd ordered high value items in the past with no problems, she said that I'd just been lucky not to have received a surcharge. Check where your items are coming from before you take the gamble.",2
Ordered an item. No item delivered. Contacted customer services. Told replacement coming. No item delivered. Contacted Amazon again. Item no longer available. Tried to contact customer services to complain and the mobile app message read as follows;We can't find the page you were trying to view. We apologise for the inconvenience.Amazon. Now you get a review here.,0
Have been using Amazon for moths. I have had several parcels delivered. My passport was demanded by courier today? I refused. I am 73years old and do not need to show ID for my age,0
"It started out as a once in awhile issue but now it's every time I order from them and now I'm just done ordering from them. Screw me over every chance they got. Right now the thing I am most angry about is the $700 I paid for my HP360 laptop.  If you don't know what a 360 is   It's one of the laptops that folds all the way backward and can become a tablet. I bought it last August. When UPS delivered it, the box was partially opened and it loomed beat up. I wasn't even home to use it for about 3 months and I've used it a grand total of about 6 times!  It's gotten worse and worse every time I've gone to use it and this morning I try to use it - and NOTHING!  Nothing at all. Not a dam thing! It won't even load. I can't open a single ap and im freaking out. So I guess I'm going to call Amazon, tho I don't know why.  Whoever answers the phone will barely speak English I won't be able to understand them and vice versa. Then they'll tell me what I already know because I just looked it up on my phone and I tried to post a bad review on Amazon -  They're not even selling that computer anymore they won't allow me to post a review at all when I try to it brings me to my other orders instead and it says it's past the return and customer help date.  So something tells me I bought a lemon and THEY KNOW IT! I need this computer.  And I was so happy when I got it. It's red, my favorite color. It's just what I wanted...we work hard for our money just for them to steal it from us. I don't hate a lot but I really hate Amazon.",0
Prices suck sometimes and shipping is awful unless you have prime.,1
"Amazon is excellent online store, and super servies !!!!",2
"Their customer support has declined severely in the last few years. They only solve my problem about 30% of the time now with some struggle when before it was always one and done with very positive interaction. Now, not so much...",1
"Amazon's drivers act on their own accord, and getting your package is not a given. Though it should be. Amazon's website is complicated, but overall it isn't terrible, but they do have things to work on",1
Reasonable prices on some items.,1
If you want an item it will always be found at Amazon. There shipping is always reasonable and on time. ,2
"The blame isn’t on Amazon because the delivery driver did his job. The Amazon driver took a photo of my pkg sitting at my door,,this driver really took the time to do his job and he provided proof that my pkg was delivered. The only problem was that, this company logo named ,( Feelin Girl) shipped me an undersized undergarment that was “kid-sized”and 10 sizes too small and It wasn’t even the size that I ordered. I need to return this Item for a refund soon.",2

"I love Amazon! They sell great, neat, and fun things. When I receive their packages, I feel excited. (Just my opinion!) Although, I always have to get refunds on clothing that do not fit, which is quite annoying. I do still love shopping! Even on Amazon.com! I also love making Wish Lists! Thanks Amazon.com! I am grateful for your company!",1
"Very long history with amazon, bought an item which passed the estimated delivery date, ordered the item on 25th January 2020, estimated delivery date 21st February 2020, today is 22/02/20 item not yet delivered.Contacted Amazon, instead of apologising and refunding me, I was informed that I have to wait for 3 more working days, whilst Amazon debited my account 26th January, no item no money and I am being told to wait, who will pay interest on that money.Very very very poor customer service, the managers are not well trained, the staff are not well trained.",0
"Poor service will be closing my account when I get my refund, ordered laptop which didn’t arrive amozan have taken the money for it. When I rang customer services they advised it will take 2 more days. After asking for refund they said it will take up to 7 working days. Poor service from manager I spoke to, taken day of work to stay home for my laptop as it was a gift. No good will gesture. Indian customer service representative clueless.",0
"Item delivered damaged in transit. I contacted amazon who asked me for photos which I did only to be told by their call centre advisor on the other side of the world there's no evidence of any damage, told me to take it up with the manufacturer but when I challenged why the manufacturer when I bought it from amazon meaning my contract was with them, she hung up! As I've now left an honest review about my experience on their website, they decided not to publish it!",0
I chose to get a laptop.  It was very easy and had great directions to go by.  The best part is that they said it would take 2-3 days to get and I received it the very next day.  I couldn’t believe it!,2
Been great customer service has been helpful when there's been an issue which in my experience is few and far between. Love giveaways in the couple years I've been doing them I've won a few time and it's kinda fun seeing the variety of products that are posted there.,2
The owners wife should have taken more than the money she should have got this entire website taken down. Customer service hahaha what a joke all they know is how to say a script and even that is hard for them. They lost nothing clearly about third party returns and policies. I used to love amazon but as the time goes by this company is just another crap one we have dealt with before.,0
"Honestly, I love Amazon in that it's convenient, and shipping is amazing. Pricing is often not particularly competitive; but it's just so easy. On the downside, I don't like supporting a company that routinely decides to censor books that don't conform to their Woke guidelines. I know it's perfectly legal because they're a private company, I just don't want to pay for it. So, I'm averaging out to 3-stars.",1

Amazon OTP system is terrible and is continually stopping me from accessing my account,0
I dont want to make it long but they sent my order late. I wasn't expecting amazon does this,1
Prime is not what it used to be! Tell you one date and it’s out for delivery then they reschedule for 5 days later. poor service. You speak to a bot it says it won’t be delivered till January and then gives you two options refund or you’re ok with it. Great!,0
Amazon stop using Hermes. They are useless. Or at least state on the order you are using them so we can then not order> They are your suppliers so start taking responsibility instead of passing the buck. I say again in case you are the only ones who do not know (or do not want to know) Hermes are useless. Goods not turned up. No idea when they will,0
"So far have had a great experience with amazon, have ordered quite a bit things from electronics to clothing, not a thing has gone wrong so far. Highly recomend getting your stuff threw amazon then any other website.",2
I've had 2 instances where I did not receive my items and customer service was great every time. Super easy and they refunded me immediately. I've had Amazon Prime for years and I can't imagine being without it.,2
"What an abysmal delivery service, I ordered a running belt and paid the extra to be delivered the same day, I’ve had an email stating it’s been delivered but it hasn’t been delivered to my door, just goes to show how bad of a company they are when they get stupid people who can’t read. Disgusting service and I’m probably not the only one that has had this experience.Well that’s me done for ordering anything off Amazon again, one unhappy customer",0

"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a shipment, they take away the packaging from their last shipment and use it again.",1
"Due to laziness, the Amazon delivery guy went to the back yard, to the back door, and left a ton of refrigerated food there w/ fresh flowers in the 98% weather. My car was parked in front of the house & there was zero indication that the back door is used.  Who does that?  Amazon has also stolen from me.They were charging me monthly fees for what they repeatedly PROMISED was their “FREE” book selling offer. Not only are prices often the highest in town, but unethical sellers send out broken junk, like the Black and Decker air compressor I bought. I refuse to do business with Amazon, after their lying & stealing from me, i feel they’re a typical greed driven corrupt entity.I didn’t purchase the food that was left at the back door, It was a gift. To me, Amazon sucks.",0
"1) Amazon should have a shipping options. They have only 2 options, 1 which is 24 hours or less and is very expensive, 2 the normal shipping is 2-3 days and can be expensive for some ,like myself who would be willing to wait 7-18 days and pay much less for shipping.     I just made an order 22 days ago and the order was supposed to arrive Dec.23 in time for Xmas,in paying they asked if the UPS can bring my order on Saturday or Sunday, with a click option for each.I clicked ""not on Saturday"", they delivered it on SATURDAY when no one was home and the whole order package was returned to Amazon.22 days later I had to contact customer  support which were very nice in offering to give me back the same amount of money I paid them 22 days before, I am sure they do this and make many $$$millions simply on $Money free interest which they invest in Amazon free loans from we buyers.(I still have not yet received my refund)",1
Thank you for,1
"I purchased an expensive item which was a Christmas present (£250+) and it was meant to arrive on Tuesday 21st December. I wait in for it and it doesn’t arrive. I talk to the live chat, and someone tells me it’ll definitey be here the next day. The same happens for the next 2 days.Thursday 23rd at 4pm I ring Amazon. The item was lost in transit on the Tuesday. They say they’re going to refund me my money. This leaves me Christmas Eve to go and buy the item from an Apple store over 50 miles away (if it’s in stock). Okay, it happens sometimes I get that, I’ll settle down and sort it. That’s when they tell me my refund won’t be with me for 5-7 working days!!! I request to speak to a manager. Natalia comes onto the phone. I’ve never spoken to a more condensing robotic person in my life. I will never use Amazon ever again. No item, and no refund in time to purchase the item before Christmas. Disgraceful. Merry Christmas",0
Like the idea of one day order with prime. Needs to be more goodss with prime and postage n packaging costs need to be removed as these are quite high for some goodss making ordering online pointless and a waste of money,1
I purchased a few items from Amazon and received them without any hassle. So far so good.,2
fantastic service on amazon getting a refund cannot fault them 110% helpfull,2
it is a usfeul company. My son has purchased things fro Amazon and he is satisfied with.,2
Hate those guys. They've lost my parcel but they said it has been stolen and they don't deal with crimes...I would never order again anything from those arrogant baste.ds!,0
This is a good site. I have great experience with amazon.,2
I love Amazon!! I’ve been a loyal Amazon and prime customer for years. Amazon is very fair and they have great refund and return policies. They deliver fast and smoothly (sometimes same day delivery) and take pictures of their deliveries to notify you when your package arrives. Amazon has a wide variety to choose from. Also a large variety of prices for each item.. you get what you pay for. I have hundreds of orders with Amazon over the years  and only 2 refunds. One for a box spring and and the other for a dent puller.,2
I am really surprised to see all of the negative reviews here. I am a very frequent customer and always receive great service. I just ordered a game we wanted quickly and it was here in less than 24 hours. I rarely have an issue with any orders and when I do it is on the vendor. I don't see how anyone cannot love Amazon.,2
"We bought a Danby DAR044A4WDD compact fridge after seeing 4 stars average from 594 Amazon customer reviews. Looked at questions answered also, stating the door was reversible. I took a minute to search by model number and there was ONE review on this model. The site clumped 13 different models, including outmoded ones, into one set of reviews making the reviews misleading and useless. It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups. Reviews are grouped, ALL purchasers of Genius microwaves of any model, ALL flavors of Green Mountain. Useless! Last month we bought a Little Tykes coupe from Quidsi an amazon store, then discovered that the same thing with a trailer was available through Amazon directly. Went to cancel the first one WITHIN FOUR MINUTES and we couldn't because it had ""shipped"". We had to take order and return it which cost us $14 UPS. What a scam...  Other than constantly and increasingly dealing with questionable information, if you do research on several websites and don't rely on Amazon to make your decisions, then you know EXACTLY what you want, they are quite amazingly fine.",1
"Amazon engages in wholesale fraud and the FTC and courts need to act.  Amazon profits from fraudulent sales when customers fail to jump through the hoops to obtain a refund and Amazon is a party to this rampant fraud by falsely asserting to customers that items never sent have instead been ""Shipped"" and that they are ""On their way, but running late"".  Amazon told me that and when I clicked ""Track Package"", Amazon suggested that I call the USPS and provided its phone number -- with no tracking information whatsoever!  Ever wonder why it's impossible to get through to the USPS on the phone?",0
"A great e-commerce portal to buy whatever you want, including stuff that you cannot find in local shops. Easy purchases, including cash on delivery, and every other means of electronic payment. Tracking is fluid and delivery is always on time. The deliveryman also bring machines to help you pay with cards. Completely satisfied with the purchase.",2
Another delivery that said it was posted through door but never arrived typical Amazon just interested in dropping things off not interested if its the right address 😡😡😡,0
I was supposed to receive 3 parcels today one of which was a birthday present non of them arrived even though it states that they had been posted through my letter box tried to chat with chat box who advised me that they have completed delivery information and they have not been delivered and to re contact them if I do not receive them by the 22/11/23 this is not the first experience of not receiving my parcels and it is not acceptable,0
"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer support at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1
I have only good experiences with Amazon.com,2
I received an item which was a pack of 4 smart plugs. Only three worked. I logged into Amazon and contacted customer service through web chat. The refunded me my money and told me to keep the three that works. Excellent customer service!,2

"This review is regarding Amazon and their misleading advertisements, which this is hardly the first time they have been accused of such and likely not the last settlement they have to pay out due to misleading statements. During the wake of our current pandemic they choose to keep profits high by making unachievable promises to unsuspecting customers regarding their shipping policies. I also a fool agreed to sign up with Amazon prime and pay 119$ a year for this two day shipping reward. As I checkout excited at the decision I made only to discover I will be lucky to receive my shipment in 3 weeks. Upon inquiring with a customer service representative they chose to guilt me as of why I expect my shipment as previously promised to me two minutes prior when they are too busy sending out medical equipment for healthcare professionals. Of course we all understand the need and importance of medical equipment at a time like this, but why are you tricking people into signing up if you know that you aren't able to supply what is promised. Of course her response was, ""well just cancel your order then."" Which of course can be done, but it's the principal of it all and their willingness to profit off of the unsuspecting and unaware. We all know how this works, no one remember to cancel in time or they are elderly or disabled and unsure of the process. Now they are not even required to supply what is advertised. Most would be understanding had they been truthful at the start, but to fabricate and make false statements and to guilt customers for asking for what was just offered to them is bad business in itself. Now had I signed up a year ago and there was no way of predicting the outcome of what could happen it would be reasonable, but covid 19 has been present and affecting all for months now. If you can't supply as promised then take the advertisement down instead of continuing to mislead consumers. Of course our star customer service members response was now, ""I don't know why they haven't took down the advertisement yet, they are probably busy with all this covid stuff."" My....how I should chose my words wisely....as if removing a single line of advertisement will take months to do. While they are so busy saving the world from Covid 19. Thank you Amazon. I got a laugh at least, even if I didn't get my shipment. Until next time, which will be sooner than you think.",0
"My package was 2 days late!! Come on Amazon, that isn't very like you!",1
"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative usage with Amazon customer support over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a shipment date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer support to get a more specific shipment date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in shipment. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended usage with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
the buy and order is fine. but lately i reviewed some goodss that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing fine to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
Never had any issues amazon prime decent for.next day order not really using amazon as much as i used to as i feel there prices are getting quite expensive used to use them for my tropical fish filter sponge and stones but its an add on item now meaning i have to spend something like £20 to get something at £3 meaning i now have to travel 25 miles to our nearest wilko for them. The pantry also a rip off order dearer than actual items.,1
"I just wanted to join free trial for 7 days for prime. I added my credit card and this TRASH company charged me endless times.. first for 12.99, then for 1,74 x 4 times.. So I ended paying too much for free trial. Last time i am going to this site... for sure. STAY AWAY GUYS",0
"Delivery arrived, but not on time. I hope next time will be faster",1
"As always, great service",2
Never ever really had issues with Amazon.Always deliver the correct items in excellent condition and always on time,2
"Long time user, very happy.",2
Excellent service throughout this difficult time. We have received orders with friendly delivery service keeping the social distancing measures. All deliveries have been met on time which we are grateful for.,2
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day order and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after Prime prices were raised and item prices are higher than in stores already. Amazon is now charging for returns also.  Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1
Prime service is one of the most beautiful things in life,2
Amazon allows an order to be cancelled before the order has been dispatched.  I ordered a phone case and then noticed it was coming from China and would be a long time arriving. I checked to see it hadn't been dispatched and sent a cancel request. When this was not acknowledged I sent three more. .A day or so later I checked my Amazon account to find it was just dispatched in spite of all my cancellation requests. Amazon now tell me I had only 30 mins to cancel the order even though it hadn't been dispatched for almost two days after my cancellation.,1
"Most of items are in fine condition, but a few items are fake.Be careful.",1
"Although my experience has been positive on Amazon I'm not a person that gives an easy five stars to anybody. I honestly can't remember having any bad experiences on Amazon or even have to return anything. One of the things I found the most irritating on Amazon is my purchase is always a few pennies short of free shipping! Normally if I can I'll add it to my wishlist and combine it with a another purchase at another time just so that I can get free shipping. My same advice applies here to any website purchase, read the reviews of the actual seller of the item. if there are a lot of negative ones your experience is probably going to be negative too!",2
Amazon is getting worse and worse!!   They should stand by their 3rd party vendors or dont use them!!   There should be a buy USA only filter.  I used to think Amazon had integrity.  Not anymore.,0
"Credible company with excellent customer service. I got scammed once by a third party seller, yet they still refund my money!",2
"I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program. I had the EXACT book as the website (Same ISB #, same edition, etc.), and they sent it back to me saying it wasn't the right book. A little upset with the whole interaction, but I still like Amazon overall.",1
"For the 2nd time in less than 2 months, I've had packages stolen because drivers refuse to follow directions to leave in lockbox. This time they lied about delivering to an unoccupied closed office,  where a non existent person supposedly signed for it. Amazon replaces, but it was something I needed TODAY.",0
"Although I have been happy with Amazon's support and prompt shipment I noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes, as most fur is imported from China and former Soviet States with animals skinned alive, electrocuted and very much abused I do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site, please consider an ethical overhaul of some item lines",1
Usually like their assistance but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1
Awesome company!!!,2
Love it! Has everything you need,2
I have never seen a delivery person because they just dump the parcel on the doorstep and clear off.,0
"Have had great prior experiences with refunds.  Refunds are usually quick and easy, although sometimes it's necessary to call the support which can be a little slow, but they usually get the job done.",2
"As a website it is decent. But if you're a sellers you will have a lot, I mean A LOT of problems, and you will surely need to consider that with a support (that answers only via email per 1 business day+ not on all questions you have. So you will repeat'n'repeat it forever, until you already will post something.) Very hard to understand how the whole tables , codes, etc work, because you can find it on some japan forums, but not on the official site.",1
Almost always cheaper than in a store. I am considering getting amazon prime now,2
"Purchase an item on the 24th aug 2023 , item was being sold by Amazon eu and advertised as in stock at time of sale . After sale I was informed delivery time to be confirmed. Nearly every day since purchase item has been advertised as in stock by Amazon eu . After contacting Amazon I was informed that the item was not in stock and also told that (in stock ) does not mean the item is in stock . Hear is what happened on 11/8/23 , the item said 13 in stock and while speaking the phone a Amazon advisor was able to tell me that there was now only 12 available while we were speaking, I asked the advisor could I not have one of the 12 and was told that is not how it works (lol) . So I pay for the item and Amazon won't deliver it but won't deliver it when it is clearly in stock and can't provide a delivery date . So if you see a item you like and is in stock, understand that the term (in stock ) written on a advertisement on Amazon platform does not actually mean (in stock) and what it does mean is very unclear.",0
"1) Amazon had a listing of what seemed like a counterfeit product (<$500 price tag for what should have been a $2k item.)2) Amazon representative told me that they personally vetted the product and that it's authenticated. I have screenshots of this conversation.3) I ended up buying the product. When I received it, it was obviously fake. Still, I paid a professional authenticator and they confirmed that it's counterfeit.4) I reported this to Amazon, they apologized, but they did not allow me to post my review on the seller's product page!In short, Amazon sold me counterfeit AND is covering up for a seller who should not only be banned, but reported to authorities.Forgot to mention, I'm a ""prime"" customer, who had easily spent multiple 5 digits with this garbage business, not out of love, but out of necessity. This is what you get when you allow psychopaths to have monopoly over the market, and then you push small businesses to shut down during a pandemic.EDIT:Remember the fake bag I bought, which the seller only had ONE of? Well, the merchant, now has a mysterious 5 star review that says ""Love it!""Except this review was posted while I was in possession of the one bag. Sooo either they're lying about stock levels to create false scarcity, or they're creating fake reviews. Take your pick.",0
Is it possible tu put less than 1 star ???? The customer service rep lied to my face telling me that my order was in advanced shipping and will definitely received my order tomorrow. Then less than 15 mn later my order was pushed back to 10 days later. And the answer from Amazon was if you bought Prime it will not happen. Oh my god is that BLACKMAIL?  But yes it is. Do not use them again. Please boycott them.,0
"Amazon have created an easy-to-use, efficient, purchasing powerhouse that makes shopping a pleasure",2
On top of terrible automated service you treat your employees terribly. You are abelist and cancel insurance for your disabled employees while refusing employees the ability to be on LTD. You have an employee dying of cancer because you won't approve her LTD despite her recent cancer diagnosis. You are disgusting and benefit off of slavery. Your operation should be shut down. ,0
"The absolute worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with, I return a $2000 item because it was incomplete and Amazon has waited over 30 days to give me my refund on the merchandise because they have yet to check it in so therefore I have to pay interest on my credit card of an item that I returned because of their screwup.",0
"The shopping usage on Amazon has been mostly positive, with a wide selection of goodss and convenient assistances.  However, improvements are needed in packaging to prevent damage during transit.  Occasional order delays and inconsistencies in goods information should also be addressed.  Despite these areas for improvement, I appreciate the convenience and variety offered by Amazon.",1

"Amazon is fine for buying low value items,  but they really like to con you on medium - higher value items and have no customer service to speak of. They have their own delivery network, so you'd think they'd be able to reflect deliveries that actually happen, not claim that things have been delivered when they haven't. By getting you to pay for items and then only delivering one or two parts of those items, while claiming that they have fully delivered the order is clearly theft. No two ways about it. Their customer serive is useless, and they just tell you to wait (until you are no longer eligible for a refund). AVOID for any values that you can't afford to throw away.",0
Where do I start? I’ve been using Amazon for years and in my opinion they went from sugar to s***. I’ve never had a problem with them until recently with some orders only 3 months apart. What’s crazy the same exact thing happened twice. First and second time I placed orders using a third party app called Klarna helps you pay for purchases in 4 payments when you can’t pay in full. First time my Amazon can’t kept saying revise payment over and over knowing damn well I had money in my bank account obviously to make a payment towards the purchases. In actuality the seller couldn’t have the decency to tell me the items were really out of stock. Had to wait even longer for it to come in ok whatever. Happens again same exact situation only this time I had to actually cancel my order because they said my bank declined payment. Bank has no recollection of anything being canceled. I’m already beyond pissed because I’m going back and forth with the absolute worst customer service ever in my life. If me and the rep can barely understand each other then damn it that’s not the job for you. Kept getting told everything got resolved that’s a lie. Kept getting told that my order was guaranteed to be delivered this Friday in actuality my order was on hold the bank so called cleared this up. What’s worst one item I ordered was for my husband for Christmas and now he has to wait even longer for his gift. How does the same exact thing happen twice? Amazon y’all really have got to do better seriously!!! Never had a problem until now y’all are absolutely ridiculous and y’all’s customer service is a damn joke do better!!!,0
"The present I ordered for my wife was supposed to be delivered today but I was not able to receive it as I was not sent the security code which was required. It may have gone to an old email address and I have been on the chat line trying to register my current email address. However, I am getting no response to my request and I need the shipment by tomorrow art the latest. How do I make real contact with anyone at Amazon to get a simple answer",1
"Not had any problems when dealing with Amazon this year.  Had a problem a couple of years ago with a tv I bought, but Amazon were fantastic and monitored all the emails back and forward between the company I bought the tv from and I got my money back.  Have every confidence when buying through Amazon.",2
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, items are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with items directly from Amazon, I find their supports lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1
"Richtig schlechte Suchergebnisse, scheinbar wird man hinters Licht geführt! Ich versuche schon seit geraumer Zeit Dinge bei Amazon zu finden. Ich sortiere immer nach „Preis aufsteigend“ und immer wenn ich das auswähle habe ich bei der suche nach Sneakern trotzdem ständig Socken in der Suche !? Wozu gebe ich dann extra sneaker ein? Ich hab auch auf die Kategorien gedrückt damit dies auch weiter ausgegrenzt wird wonach ich suche, vergeblich. Wenn ich spezifisch nach Markenschuhen suche dann Findet man nichtmal die Ergebnisse die einem empfohlen wurden. Also sobald man die Suchergebnisse gefiltert haben will, wirft Amazon deine suche über Bord. Achja ich bin selbst Web Developer und es liegt nicht an dem Benutzer! Amazon kann so eine Sortierung garnicht gewährleisten durch ihre Amazon SEO. Ziemlich traurig und ist ein Armutszeugnis.Really bad search results, it seems like you're being fooled! I've been trying to find things on Amazon for quite some time now. I always sort by ""price ascending"" and whenever I select that, I still have socks in the search when looking for sneakers!? Why do I enter extra sneakers then? I also pressed on the categories so that this is further excluded what I am looking for, in vain. When I search specifically for branded shoes, you can't even find the results that were recommended to you. So as soon as you want to filter the search results, Amazon throws your search overboard. Oh yes, I'm a web developer myself and it's not the user's fault! Amazon can't guarantee such sorting at all through their Amazon SEO. Quite sad and is an indictment of poverty.",0
Amazon are the best customer service providers I’ve ever known. Every purchase I’ve had issues with has always been dealt with professionally and I’ve never been disappointed.,2
"If you plan to buy anything from AMAZON... make sure that it is NOT coming from a 3rd party seller thru AMAZON! You could end up in a loop to loop bounce around of who is at fault IF your purchase does not show up. And if it ships USPS, well that is added I do not know to the issue because USPS can never give you a true meaningful day & time. All this happened to me beginning on 4/16/24.",0
"I love Amazon! Great products, quick delivery, excellent customer service, but... Double check prices with other sellers, Amazon isn't always cheap. Often it's not even Amazon, but a 3rd party seller on the Amazon platform. Track your delivery with shop.com to make sure you really get it. With doorstep thieves running around, have them drop off the package at a pick-up location if nobody is home, or it may be gone before you get to it. Great return policy, no questions asked.",2
Amazon can be acceptable but when its ordinary its ordinary. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
Amazon are streets ahead of the competition and I will always be loyal to them.  However on the subject of customer communication pathways they are last.I needed their help during a difficult period of my life and I just couldn’t get their attention.What do you do with a friend who despite your best efforts continues to ignore you. Yes that person becomes an ex friend. Simply not fine enough Amazon.,1
"The shipping times are so bad now, thinking of canceling prime. Ordered a video game that shipped last Saturday with 2 day shipping and it's still not here. Not lost, just moving extremely slow. It's been in my state since yesterday, in a city 30 minutes away and it's still moving slow.",0

Brilliant overseas mailing service for presents,2
"I ordered two of the exact same sweatshirts from Amazon 2 weeks ago. The only thing different was the color. One of them arrived within four to five days. The other one never arrived although I kept checking the shipment status. I finally got a notification that it was undeliverable as addressed and it was sent to another address. Seriously? It was from the same order, same address, same everything.  How could one get there with no problem and the other one couldn't find its way to my home....so they just sent it back to the ""third party shipper""?  My account was credited, but I question how one part of my order arrived with no problem but for the other part of the order they couldn't find me?",1
fine. swift order also,1
I love it......,2
Amazon are the best shopping experience ever. Their customer service is second to none and you can virtually buy anything from here and always at a cheaper price.,2
Always easy and always as promised. I love the convenience!,2
I love Amazon for next day deliveries but when it never happens it’s frustrating all you get is generic we appreciate your business and support but never a solution,0
"Recently, I have been having issues with my orders; receiving items that I did not order, receiving items that do not work (are defective), unable to return purchases, required to pay additional cost for items upon arrival, etc.  As a result, I have been spending too much time following up with Vendors, calling customer assistance, asking for refunds, and returning items; all defeating the purpose of online shopping.I believe that Amazon should spend more time in qualifying their Vendors.  Online shopping should be straight forward: 1) buy an item 2) receive the item ordered.Very disappointed.",1
"Amazon says there was a billing issue with my account. I have called them multiple time and emailed them multiple times to address this issue but they are playing pass the buck game. Phone call says I have to email, while email says I have to call. How hard is it to take the payment information to address this issue and then unlock my account.",0
"Amazon is a very fine support, however I can find nowhere to report a discrepancy between the comment the order driver made and the actuality! The comment read “handed to resident”. Not so, we were in and listening for the order - having tracked it. But no ringing of the bell or knocking of the door, just dumped.I’ve tried to find a place on their web site to report this - it’s not the first time - to no avail!! Sad really as parcels they send by Royal Mail or other support always come with a ring or knock!! Making this a reliably, safe order. That’s really is my only complaint about an otherwise very fine company!",1
"I have ordered titan watch of rs 5000 from amazon but that was too loose so I went to titan shop in season mall in pune I asked that person to remove 1 clip so he told me that this watch is not original titan not make this kind of model. It's a fake watch. I was very shocked that how come it is possible coz it's come with name and logo so I talked to my sister iwho is working with one Amazon dealer in mumbai and when i heard this from her mouth that time was speechless i wanted to share with u she told me that where she is working that dealer buy earphone in rs 20 from China packed with brand name and logo and they sell here of rs 1500 with brand name like JBL, Motorola, Sony and it's works almost 6 months and  no one can find it's fake. if when someone find that it's not working or some problem in their earphone that time can't replace it coz replacing time already gone.   It's very bad I will never ordered from Amazon. Amazon u just came before some years back and really means people can't go out and buy product whatever they want. even i.  R u trying to fool people.",0
Happy with service. They handled an incorrect order very well. Good stuff!,2
"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping assistance. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few average and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman assistance suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1

I've been very pleaded with Amazon.I have sent for many things.Shirley and Gene,2
"The very worst!  They sent me an email regarding recalled products and to contact customer service for a refund.  I contacted customer service and after over an hour of arguing with them, they said that I can't have a refund because the order is expired and it's to late.  Understand that by law they must refund recalled items. The product was purchased in August 2019 and the recall just came out on January 30, 2020 covering January 2013-November 2019.  This, by law, must be refunded, but no, they will let me return it with a restocking fee.  Yes, that is right, a restocking fee for a product that is recalled and they are going to restock it!!!!!!   WTH!!!!!!!  How does Amazon get away with this?  I am contact the FDA, the BBB and t",0
Always uses USPS even after reporting that we were having issues with them. Packages always lost cos they leave them a block away from our house.,1
Very bad assistance trough chat when canceling shipments.  Very poor attitude and service.  I had a terrible experience!!!  Do not recommend!!!,0
"I've made many orders with Amazon.com over the years and have generally been very pleased, except for my last order which was a complete disaster which never made it to me and is presumed stolen by an Amazon or UPS employee. The item is tracked however never made it in to UPS's hands. I waited three weeks then started contacting Amazon for help, each time being passed on to an Indian call center, and each time they were generally rude and unhelpful and refused me a refund and outright lied to me, was not until I demanded to be put through to an American did the problem finally get resolved, a month and  a half after the goods went missing. Has put me off ordering from them ever again. 'World's best customer assistance' my foot..",1
"My usage with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the order company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
"I never received two orders I placed. Tried calling Amazon, they were supposed to refund one of my products but never did. Also took off a negative review I put on their site.",0
"Customer since 2008. Customer service has really gone downhill. Rude supervisors, non-English speaking customer service agents and it now takes over 30 days to receive a refund.",0
I like amazon but when I wanted to voice my opinion about a seller they would not post my review,1
"They were good but nowadays they are joking. There are many options for us to shop, we just need to spend some time to find the right store or site. As customers our laziness made Amazon as a big company, it is not about their product or services. The painful experience you will get from Amazon is when your item is not shipped on time or received damaged items. As they already moved to technologies business like AWS, Alexa, they don’t care about their e-commerce business. This company will go down if they operate their e-commerce business like this & that will also happen only because of customers like us.",0

Normally I have no issue with Amazon. Sellers have been good. Fast shipping. But my last order. They have processed and cancelled the payment over 9 times. Spoke to Amazon they are less then helpful. Telling me it will go back in my account 5-10 days. Luckily my bank is great and issues me back the over charges leaving one pending to clear. But then the next day they put in 4 more. That makes my car insurance payment bounce. Go to the bank put in money to clear that payment. Bank again gives me my money back leaving one pending. This morning I wake up to 3 charges. Wft is wrong with Amazon. All you need is ONE authorization. Not 9. That’s over 1400.00 you have pending for a 164 payment. And there remedy is to offer a 10.00 Amazon GC. Really?!?!  Do better Amazon the worst customer service there is!!!!!!,0
"Always ships, really good",2
Looks acceptable but to be honest pretty terrible. The order time is terrible and the price is way too expensive. Ebay is way better. ,1
Usually like their support but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1
I always found almost anything I need on Amazon. Customer service above and beyond. If the problem with items. They will issue refund fast .We pay the membership for free shipping and it great. Thank you .,2
I bought a piece of equipment about four years ago that was junk from Amazon and the company that I had to send it back to you charge me $17 to have it shipped back to them I called Amazon and they assured me that they were going to give me a $17 credit which they say is on my account but every time I try to use it I cannot find it and when they help me they tell me I cannot use it this has been going on for three years and every time I chat with them all I do is get jerked around they should be ashamed of their customer service department,0
"Everything okay, sometimes I get order faster sometimes not. I only buy through Amazon, not 3rd person. But one annoying thing they do not accept different recensions than 100% positive, if you wanna put truly opinion they will not accept your recension. That's scamming of people.",1

"*DO NOT TRUST AMAZON*Everyone who has EVER purchased anything on Amazon check all of your bank statements very closely. Look for Prime that you have never subscribed to also for Amazon Music. When you place an order with a third party seller, they (Amazon) have a habit of ""accidentally"" signing you up to one of these subscription services and charging to ANY CARD that has been used to buy a product. Even if it is not in the name of the person who holds the Amazon account.Example! My 70 year old mother was being billed for Amazon music, she did not even know about this. It went on for months. Finally yesterday I got to the cause of it and Amazon has agreed to refund ALL 8 wrongfully claimed payments from a pensioner. That amounted to almost £80 STOLEN from a vulnerable person.They also agreed to refund the £9.99 STOLEN from my card. It only came to my attention when I used my mothers Amazon to order an item from a third party seller. When I checked my card. I had been charged £9.99 for Amazon music, as my mother's registered card was lost and had to be cancelled and replaced. So Amazon took the money without authorisation from my account. Just to add. I have now been charged £1 by amazon only a day after this scamming, thieving, fraudulent bunch of vultures ""apologised"" for stealing money. I therefore deleted both my card and my mother's card from amazon. I suggest EVERYONE does the same. If you buy anything on Amazon, DO NOT STORE YOUR CARD!!! Simply input it for each transaction. Your money is NOT SAFE!! Better than that NEVER USE AMAZON. We never will again!!Had this not happened, and I had not been charged my mother would never have known about this and Amazon would have continued pocketing her money. Along with their tax avoidance schemes. So be warned. This company openly admitted to me that the system sometimes ""accidentally"" subscribes when a purchase is made. The person who scripted Amazon's website must be a total amateur if this is what happens. So everyone get checking you statements, if you see one payment to AMAZON MUSIC or AMAZON PRIME, that you have not asked for, go to your bank (or call them) Order statements dating back to when you first started using Amazon. You may find more unauthorised charges. Also if you have elderly parents who use amazon help them check their account. Amazon do not pay tax correctly, why should they also get away with STEALING from vulnerable people.My mother's was almost £80, your refund could be more, It depends how long it has been ongoing. But every penny they have taken without permission will be refunded. And Amazon if you're reading this. ALL CARDS have now been removed from your scummy site and not one more order will be placed using Amazon. Sorry this is a long post but it needed explaining in case amazon are stealing from others. They certainly won't check their end, as long as they get their money coming in. So ensure you all check.I would love to have replies on here of anyone who checks their account and finds they have been unknowingly charged. I know for a fact amazon do it frequently, my bank told me this and even said they refund people OFTEN. So there is a good chance of you being owed and I would love to hear about your situation.Thanks for reading.",0
"I've used an amazon EC2 to run a small linux and didn't understand the free tier, asked for help and got an amazing reply very detailed and very fast!",2
Cheap price. So far not ordinary.,1

"I ordered a few items for a trip. The delivery date I was given (for 2 day because I’m a prime member) has come and gone twice.  My advice is if you need something by a specific date, don’t order from Amazon.",0
"Good, friendly support, quick and easy.",1
"It's a great support.. however, since I never know if I'm actually going to get what I paid for due to theft risk and order gamble. It would be nice to not have ""package delivered"" show on your order until it was actually delivered. It would also be nice if the drivers actually took packages to your door.",1
Would give them a higher score if the shipment drivers stopped leaving my parcels on the doorstep in full view of everyone and then saying they'd handed it to the resident! Needs sorting out,1
I love love love amazon. You can get anything you need and everything you need from this site. Sometimes there are problems but for the most part it always seems to work great!,2
"My review relates to author's whose books are listed on there.  I would not buy anything from them at this stage, even if they paid me to do so.  When the company receive a DMCA, staff member 'Chad' will claim that he's unable to read, despite working in a legal department.  He will insist that you re-send the DMCA several times before it is accepted.  It is often better to leave Amazon as a last resort, email all other contacts first, because they normally resolve the issue while Amazon are still claiming that they can't find your address, or some other detail, on the DMCA in front of them.  Unfortunately, you will probably have to deal with Amazon, because they host a large number of the illegal download sites.  As regards illegal book download sites, you will notice that any inaccuracies stated on Amazon are copied onto the illegal download sites. As regards inaccuracies stated on Amazon; edits to one Amazon site will not carry over onto the other sites, you have to edit each individually.  They will not delete your books, even if they are out of print, or were never available for sale.  They allow book sellers to make any changes they wish, but deny that right to the copyright owner.  This is because they derive a monthly income from book sellers and they want you to pay that fee as well, so although there is an 'author central' for UK, France, Germany, Japan and America, they will often ignore your edits, complete them incorrectly, or claim that you wish to edit something they are not able to edit.  I would note that not all the Amazon sites are completely incompetent and I will do separate reviews for those, having now dealt with all of them.    The American site are rude and unwilling, they take an absolute age to make the simplest of edits and willfully admit that they have people registered as the 'copyright owner', or 'publisher' of work not owned by the registrant - when asked to elaborate or provide details, they will refuse to do so, thereby willingly and knowingly supporting copyright and royalty theft.  'Mike Hammer' of Amazon (US) will eventually send you a supervisory email, after you've received multiple emails from the 'team' about unrelated issues, suggesting that they do not understand your edit, or their job.  His email will inform you that the correct way to edit Amazon US is to fill out the 'Report a Problem' form on each page, as members of the public do and then he will inform you that you could join 'seller central' (paid service), where you will be able to edit whatever you want - thereby giving an author less rights to their own work than; publishers, thieves, the public, book sellers and of course; Amazon.  He will then abruptly inform you that 'this is Amazon's final response to this issue', like the sociopathic, pumped up incompetent he is and as such displaying his unfounded arrogance, as such people love to do, because it gives them a temporary feeling of unachieved superiority, which is much quicker than working for that stuff. Not only that, apparently Amazon pay minimal wage and low taxes, so there is little wonder that they are a billion dollar company, but only when there is no more art and no service amenities and all workers are living off food stamps will society realize that Amazon may be cheap, but its' company practice is not what the world needs and by then it will be too late, so for your own purposes;Only send them a DMCA when you have exhausted all other options.  Unless it is of huge importance, don't even bother contacting the American site regarding edits to their listings, if their incompetence doesn't get you, their attitude problem will.If your book has been listed incorrectly, you would be best advised to edit it on other sites, so that your other listings are correct.  Other book selling sites are only too happy to hear from an author and make appropriate edits, because good listings sell books and that is their business.  Don't waste too much time on Amazon and don't pay them any money, unless you really have to/want to.I would further note, unlike other companies listed on this site, there is no option to send your review to the company you are praising/complaining about.  Now, officially that will be because they are 'too busy', but given their standard of service, that is obviously incorrect.  The actual reason is that they have no interest whatsoever in what any of you think; good or bad.  They just want your money.",0
"amazon now has terrible customer service and expects you to pay $8 to return items that do not work from 3rd parties that amazon delivers for, OR TO DRIVE AN HOUR TO RETURN THE STUFF THAT YOU WAITED FOR DAYS TO ARRIVE to return them to amazon because THEY DID NOT WORK, WASTING CUSTOMERS TIME WHEN THE SELLER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND REFUSES TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AS CLAIM.

"Today being stalked by Amazon. Sending me MENS VANS SKATEBOARDING SHOES ONTO MY PHONE. I am sick to death of Amazon stalking me on my phone 😭😭😭😭😭 I continue having complications with both talking to any English speaking CSR and getting rudely spoken to by foreign people overseas who clearly Do Not Care:( That I am a Prime Member means nothing to Amazon. I have been trying to buy a dog stroller on a payment plan. They approve the payment plan and then proceed to charge my Card for the over $320.00 full price of the dog stroller. The payment plan is to pay for this item month to month. Not all at once. I have bought 2 other items using their month to month plan with no problems. Yet the minute I try to buy this very important item they charge the full price even though I checked Month to month and the agreement shows I will only be charged a fraction of the full price. Zero help from Amazon about this. I contacted Petique the dog stroller makers and all they said was 'Sorry about Amazon,"" So Zero help. Many of my packages get stolen or delivered to completely different cities and I get cruel emails telling me my order has been delivered to me-when in fact it has not. I feel like there is a criminal element to my account because people email me telling me I need to change me mailing delivery instructions just seconds after I place my Amazon order. Also telling me to ""Update your Billing Address"". I have called and emailed Amazon about all of these issues and its always the same 2 voices of 2 men; they are very rude, sarcastic and sounds like a former landlord who did very bad things to me. It has gotten scary ordering anything from Amazon anymore. Amazon also continues sending me Suggestions to buy: MENs Watches. MENs Clothing. MENs Shoes. ALL MENs items. I am a Disabled Woman with Cancer. I have NEVER bought ANY Mens items and have asked them to stop sending me MENs suggestions. It is very disturbing the way they treat me; so badly! I can't believe I am paying them and they still do all these terrible things to me.",0
This has been a very stressful experience for my wife and her father.We ordered an adjustable bed for my father in law who was being discharged from hospital he is 73 and in ill health so he has come to live with us he can’t get in and out of a normal bed so we ordered this one from Amazon as it would be delivered earlier than others we looked at with other companies as until than his sleeping on a sofa so we really need one asap.First the bed was to be delivered between the 18th-19th Nov than it was confirmed it would be delivered on 19th that was fine I took a day off work and lost a days pay but it had to be done the bed never arrived and no word to say what was happening than that night it was updated to say it’l now be delivered between 20th-25th so I messaged customer service who apologised and said they would refund me £7.99! Personally I find that an insult after waiting in all day and as I say losing a days pay.I was very surprised by Amazon as I’ve usually found the customer service is very helpful and knowledgeable.I asked to cancel the order but apparently that’s not possible and informed I would now have to refuse delivery at the door.I couldn’t get anywhere with customer service at all so I’m now closing my Amazon account and all connected accounts and will never use them again I just feel like they couldn’t be bothered to find a solution so I will never spend my money with them again.I now need to start looking elsewhere for a bed.My father in laws physio only agreed to discharging him when she knew the adjustable bed would be here asap if she had known it wasn’t being delivered his discharge from hospital would of been delayed until it did arrive.,0
"The website would not take a new delivery address after 3 attempts.  Then I called the service center only to get someone who spoke with an Asian accent with incredible noise in the background. She kept having to put me on hold to drowned out the noise.  She also told me that she could not place an order for me, that she could only instruct me on how to do it on-line.  Go figure as it was not working on-line for me which was why I called.  After many attempts she finally put the delivery address in for me and then I received a confirmation email.  She asked me repeatedly to spell things as the Asian language and the English language are so different that getting it right the first time in her position is nearly impossible.  This was such a frustrating experience and confirms why I don't like Amazon or to order from them unless there is just no other way.",0
"You place an order through Amazon Business because you run a business - that is common sense. So Amazon decide your parcel is going to be delivered next day (order placed at the very start of the day so following day is not a huge demand) but wait for it - outside of business hours.Then you get a message ""your parcel has been left at reception"". I do not have a reception and outside of business hours on an industrial estate there are very few people about. The delivery driver therefore leaves it outside....in the rain. It has rained all night. The package is water sensitive and you know there is going to be a problem when you pick it up and it takes over a minute for the water to run out of the plastic bag the driver left it in.Can you contact Amazon - No!Chatbot is the best you can do.You have to be a special kind of stupid to leave a parcel out in the rain - 12 hours worth of rain at that.Ruined parcel and whilst a refund has been authorised by the chatbot it takes 5 to 7 days for the money to reach my account - quick enought to take it but hang on to it as long as they can. Aside from that, we actually needed the goods - it's why we have Business Prime - for NEXT DAY DELIVERY",0
"Amazon is taking longer and longer to ship. When they finally do, they send your parcel (in N.B.) with Bonshaw. THE WORST DELIVERY COMPANY EVER!!! Have you read their reviews Amazon? NOT ONE is positive, the company is despised and yet you insist on using them and losing customers because of it. Prime membership is a joke, as is guaranteed delivery date. SO close to closing my account!!",0
Normally they are okay but ther seller account is a joke. I got charged 19p for I dont know what and just using it is a pain.,1
"I am writing this review literally minutes after having a WONDERFUL interaction with Amazon's customer service. I wish I had her name but I would like to thank the sweet customer service lady for assisting me with a billing issue on my account. She waa extremely polite, patient, & understanding. She was also very prompt with solving the issue and notified me my billing issue would reflect on my account within 3-5 business days which is understandable. I have used their services for years and have always had positive interactions with their team.",2

"I have ordered two items in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.  Now I am wondering if I can trust them to get a package delivered for Christmas, even with “guaranteed “ order dates.",1
pretty good site but not always lowest - should look around,2
"I paid £349 for an Apple series 9 watch when I received the package imagine my surprised when I opened it to find a book and two blind spots mirrors that are worth 2% of the price of what I paid for the Apple Watch. I contacted Amazon customer service straight away since then it’s been a nightmare to get any sort of help, all the employees I have spoken to have been anything but helpful all of them kept telling me different information and lying to cover themselves and the company up whilst essentially refusing to process my refund. To make matters worse i have provided prove that I was sent the wrong item it is clear the package its self that I was sent weighs way more then the apple watch, the Apple Watch that I bought official weight is 31.9 grams whilst the package I was sent weigh 0.34kg or 340 grams to be precise. Be care Amazon is no longer what it use to be it is now full of dishonest employees and thieves looking to steal your hard earn packages for their own profitable gains. ",0
Amazon is getting worse and worse!!   They should stand by their 3rd party vendors or dont use them!!   There should be a buy USA only filter.  I used to think Amazon had integrity.  Not anymore.,0
"Don’t believe the hype!After weeks of not receiving the product I ordered, I attempted to submit a review only to be informed that my input is “under review”. This leads me to believe that the reviews are skewed if the only reviews accepted has to be “reviewed” to their liking. IJS",0
"Delivery NO STARS: They mainly use UPS which has consistently lost or wrong address delivered packages. UPS refuses to take any fault for packages they lose or deliver to the wrong home, sometimes even in the completely wrong state or town which should be something easy to notice. But apparently as long as they delivered it, it shouldn't matter where and they shouldn't have to refund the item or replace it. It's absolutely disgusting business tactics and their affiliation with UPS Will only ruin their reputation as it continues. I RECOMMEND FINDING A SERVICE NEAR YOU OR ONLY ORDERING FROM CITES THAT USE FEDEX OR REGULAR POSTAL DELIVERY AND NOT UPS. Products 3 stars: pretty wide range of items you'll find anything you need. Its 50 50 on price it'll either cost more than your local store or less so it can be a bargain if used right. ALWAYS READ PRODUCT REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE. you'd be surprised what items actually pose the most issues but trust the most recent reviews and make your purchase accordingly. Sometimes the item is fine but the means of order are awful. Prices 3 stars: all prices are basic standard prices not really any higher ir lower than local prices. You'll save as much as you would using coupons on a store basically. But if you dont like going out because your sick or other reasons, it is very useful to avoid social contact. Customer support 5 stars: these guys are not playing games. If you lose money, theyr losing money to. Take advantage of customer support and be patient! I have had wonderful results and always ended up getting a refund or a return with their help, all be it sometimes it's a long process so again, patience is key. But they will hunt people down for you no joke.",1
"I love the convenience of ordering online, however the shipment system for this company fails in many ways by having ""lazy"" shipment individuals deliver the items. I have had items wet, muddy, run over, and simply lost in a place not visible to retrieve them. This is an ongoing problem with Amazon. They need their own trucks and driver to eliminate this problem.",1
i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early,2
"My experience with Amazon has usually been good, with one obvious exception.  When I order something that is shipped and delivered by Amazon, it's always a disaster.  Additionally, their customer service now seems to be non existent.  Getting lost orders replaced is a headache and they'll manage to ship a replacement after you jump through their hoops.  But it will take a week or more for them to ship it.",0

"I love Amazon, for the supports they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the goodss or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' interactions. Typical corporate America. No matter how many decent things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
I am living in the uk and I have a British bank account as well as German account because I have moved 5 years ago to the UK. It is not possible to send from a German Amazon account or 🇬🇧 account anything to my family and friends. All payments declined even i have enough money on the German and British bank account. I guess thank Boris! Or What?,1
"Okay so my problem with amazon originally started as my fault, i put the wrong address. Instead of putting west I put east. On the day of the delivery the driver called me, I apologized and gave him the correct address, and he told me he would update the address and I would get it delivered the following day. Cool.So the following day I check my shipping address at 6 am, and it wasn't corrected. I did the chat thing and the chatter informed me that she added it to the delivery instructions. Skeptical, I called in and the lady on the phone confirmed with me I would receive the package today at the corrected address.A few hours go by and I receive a call from the driver that he was at the wrong address, yet again, and when I gave him the corrected address he said it was outside of his delivery zone.So I call in again and after a 30 minute phone call of just trying to update my address for the following day, the guy told me he updated the notes and address. Address was still incorrect and delivery notes were deleted and he put that I wanted my order the following day.So I then do the chat thing again and they inform me to replace the order and I would get a full refund, which would've worked but I had ordered the last item in stock. So I ask if I can update the address and they tell me no and ask if I want to speak to a specialist.I understand the mistake was originally my fault but it is a simple mistake and I was willing to wait a few days to accommodate that but they have no basic understanding of what I am asking for.",0
"Terrible speed on shipping!  I ordered my product from Valuenetpc  Inc on the Amazon website.  Valuenetpc  Inc didn't ship my product until December 5th. I ordered on December 3rd, 2019.    I dont believe Amazon had anything to do with the shipping.  Just think before ordering anything on Valuenetpc  Inc., not long before my order with I ordered two items from Best Buy.  They gave me free over night shipping and sure enough it was the very next day I received both my Best Buy items.  Best Buy I'll order from again.  When I initially wrote this review I didn't realize the shipper was Valuenetpc  Inc.  Just think before you order from Valuenetpc  Inc.  I hope this review helps others.  Oh, by the way,the tracking information said I should receive my product December 9th through December 12th.  It's now December 12, 2019 at 6:42 p.m. and I haven't received my purchased item.",0

"Customer support could be way better, managed to have my refund for a item but it took a while because the support was not able to provide it with enough proof, everything else was okay but that should be something to work on. (This was something related to Amazon Prime)",1
I love the fact if you get prime you get free shipping.i don’t like there return policy cause to me when a adult toy messes up I wouldn’t want it back as for Amazon they want it sent back. I love that you can get on Amazon and practically get anything you want from toilet paper to motor oil.,1
"Seller beware This company is rubbish.You make a complaint you speak to a different person every time then they close the complaint I sold over £600 worth of stock I receive £200 back after fees which aren’t obvious. They are not equipped with handling complaints I had my items fulfilled by Amazon when I asked for them back they come back in damaged packaging and sporadic deliveries I sent them all over in one delivery they send it back to me all the six deliveries over five days, yes 2 in one day from 2 different delivery companies whf?eBay is crap but at least you know where you are there. Some customers or con artists which ever you wanna call them can make a living out of asking Amazon for their money back. Amazon just refund the customer the money back but don’t ask for the product back yet they still keep your sellers for your £5 pound in every £20 and you’re just left it suck it up. Dealing with this company has been one of the worst experiences of my business life I own three companies and I’ve never had to deal with anything so bad or people incompetent.",0
Every time I order I'm left with tons of Packaging to dispose of!,1
"I have shopped on Amazon for years. Most times the good are good and received in a timely manner. Returns have generally been OK with the odd blip for some farawy country where there is a lot of sharp practice. Amazon do not protect you from this. That said Amazon has a lot of problems:1. A customer service team which is difficult to access and does not do it's job. Its investigations are superficial and they give glib stock answers and frequently don't take appropriate action even when they say they will. A recipe for real customer frustration and I am VERY frustrated with this service.2. I have noticed 8 recurring charges of 17.99 on my account. I have tried to get them to investigate it. I got a stock answer about why this could be happening. So they have not investigated it - otherwise they would have known what the charges were for. I will get my bank to investigate this now.I also have nearly 8 consecutive charges for Prime membership, despite the fact I had cancelled it. They don't always action your cancellation. Sometimes I have 2 Amazon Prime charges within a couple of days or a couple of weeks. Are they telling me I caused this. I will now get my bank to investigate this too.3. Amazon goods are not necessarily cheaper. In fact I have paid over the odds for many things, but I have only found out after purchase.I am now done with Amazon. I believe either its digital platform is faulty, hence the charges or they have dishonest staff who access my card. I won't know which until the investigation is complete.I believe it is worth taking time over what you buy and if I have to pay a little more I will. I believe the safest way to shop is go to the shops. Amazon created a buzz around internet shopping but I have seen its flaws and belueve I am now actually out of pocket financially.",0
"Awful company. Refuse to refund payments for wrong deliveries, missing deliveries stated as being 'stolen' by customer service but nothing done about it, customer service always saying I'd be contacted within 24 hours by email or phone, but that never happens.

"With a single push of a button, your enrolled in a membership, your account is charged. There is no security measure in place to make sure this was not a mistake.

"I was shocked the first time I looked back through my order history to find an item I wanted to re-order. I cannot believe how many things I have purchased from Amazon in the past 5 years!!! It was an enlightening experience to go through soooo many pages, Amazon has become my automatic go-to site to purchase just about anything. I don't buy everything from them, but I darn sure look there first before I check any other websites. I am a disabled veteran and live in a home for disabled vets, and haven't left here in 4 years to shop as the busses cause me too much pain, so most of my purchases are online. Also we have around 650 members here and many have me find and buy items for them online as well. What else can I say but....Thank the Lord for Amazon.com!!!!",2
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1

"Absolutely unbelievably bad service! I have ordered things from Amazon waisted time and money , just for ups to deliberately deliver this parcel to someone else and sign for it (so somebody basically stolen my parcel and forge my signature) then when I call ups they refused to get in contact with driver directly and ask him where he delivered this parcel (since they have log in system and exactly can identify the responsible driver) ! So from that you can draw only one simple conclusion, that they are bunch of thieves and nothing else . Their solution was basically to go through some claim process instead of contacting the drive claiming process that is completely broken and takes like hour to go through it ! Such behaviour to your customers who paid is completely unacceptable and appalling ! Amazon why you even using 3rd parties to deliver",0

"Good prices, quick order (via prime) and excellent customer support mean that I now buy most things through Amazon. They have removed the stress and risks of buying decents for me and I now receive a few parcels a week from them. In the rare cases when there are issues contacting customer support quickly resolves them.Update from my original 5 star review. Amazon have become more aggressive as they seek to monetise their high market share. Alexa continually tries to sell you more supports (you cannot stop this) to the point of ruining the user usage and has today signed me up for an audible subscription it offered my six year old and she declined  (Alexa has the recording DON’T sign me up).Customer support now don’t offer email and the chat use literally two hours of life I’ll never get back refusing to acknowledge the issue or allow me to raise a complaint.

Sometimes I find things that I didn't know I needed!!!,2

I’ve always had fairly decent usages with amazon - it’s more the order supports! Ever since they started cap amounts (so spend £20 to get anything delivered free) and then outsourcing order. Numerous times I have had deliveries marked as ‘handed to a resident’ when it hasn’t and is either lost of hanging out the letterbox for someone to steal!,1
Their chat customer support is absolutely rubbish. They want you to keep typing the same thing over and over. I gave up in the end.,1
"Ordered 3 items last month and havent get it yet . Its been a month. 30 days. Talked to their cs everyweek . After 20 days,1 item has been shipped (says in the app but no email or whatsoever) and its been 10days i havent got it. Anything NADA!!. Yes i have been charge.. 3 CS said they can fix it coz it was only stuck in their warehouse. Then this guy, the last CS i talked to said he cant do anything about it. What a surprise",0
"Honestly, noo too ordinary no too fine, is fine",1
"Amazon just blocked a return of an expensive defective item that they sold us.  We are well within the promised 30 day return window. We have tried to process it every which way.  No luck.  Also discovered, inline with this new change, there is now no way to chat, no way to call anymore. We all are just out of luck. This is grossly dishonest. Amazon.com",0
I noticed lately when ordering from Amazon my packages do not come on the days they supposed to come. My packages are coming days later. Amazon used to be acceptable on delivering packages on time. Now it seemed like they just don't care!?!? I hope soon they can fix this issue.,1

They have only 2 options, 1 which is 24 hours or less and is very expensive, 2 the normal shipping is 2-3 days and can be expensive for some ,like myself who would be willing to wait 7-18 days and pay much less for shipping.     I just made an order 22 days ago and the order was supposed to arrive Dec.23 in time for Xmas,in paying they asked if the UPS can bring my order on Saturday or Sunday, with a click option for each.I clicked ""not on Saturday"", they delivered it on SATURDAY when no one was home and the whole order package was returned to Amazon.22 days later I had to contact customer  support which were very nice in offering to give me back the same amount of money I paid them 22 days before, I am sure they do this and make many $$$millions simply on $Money free interest which they invest in Amazon free loans from we buyers.(I still have not yet received my refund)",1
I purchased prime membership 6 months before. Most of the times my goodss are delivered late.It says that it will be delivered tomorrow but it gets delivered day after tomorrow or even late sometimes.,1
"Update on my earlier review of amazon re one item damaged and the other missing.Found the phone number  and contacted them not expecting too much.How wrong was I ,the whole problem was dealt with by a charming lady and the replacement was delivered to me by Mon 10th.Thank you Amazon.",2
"LOVE amazon! Its usually my first port of call for internet shopping; but if its not, then i do use it for internet price comparisons. everything i can think of is on amazon! However, i do find it a bit frustrating that amazon have other 'market place sellers' so if you have an order with different sellers you have to pay different postage costs.... been caught out a couple of times. :-SOn the whole, competitively priced and very useful!",2
It seems my orders are coming from places other than Amazon. I don’t like that these people get my email and spam me.,1
"Amazon has become such a greedy corporation using bait and switch delivery times so you order and then they change the delivery. I ordered something on prime which said next day delivery and it wasn't even shipped next day and took 5 days to receive.Jeff Bezos and Amazon are unethical and have no loyalty except to money & greed. Amazon platform was designed as a, ""online retail outlet"" for businesses and people to sell on.It wasn't enough to put many mom & pop stores out of business, their greed took over and they turned their backs on the very same people that built their business, the sellers.Once Amazon analyzed sales reports and repeat sales they decided to screw the seller and began to sell their own branded products like batteries etc.They used the US Postal Service, FEDEX and UPS until they decided to operate delivery services.They place their ""ads"" prominently when you search for a product, giving them a greedy, unfair advantage.If that wasn't enough their Prime Services have gotten more expensive and they pushed back their delivery guarantees.Prime has increased, Amazon Music has increased, Audible has increased and NOW, after paying for an inferior ""Prime"" product that continues to decline, they decided to put ads on Prime Video and if you want ""ad free"" it is an additional $2.99 per month.Amazon Prime is inferior to Netflix as I have no issues streaming on Netflix or other Apps on tv, but Amazon constantly has lag issues and connection issues and doesn't respond.I have already been trimming my Amazon reliance, left Amazon Music, left Audible, using Amazon much less and can't wait to pull the plug on Amazon completely.I heard FEDEX is now going to compete with Amazon and in Fall of 2024 they are supposed to be launching their own online selling platform!! I can't wait!!",0
Sometimes there are a few problems with Amazon.,1
"I am a ling long time Amazon.com fanatic and spend a bunch of $$ every month. HOWEVER, lately, (blaming the virus) they're playing ""Fast and Loose"" with ""Prime  Member Delivery"" .I Do Not consider 2 week shipping OR ""4 OR 5 WEEKS from China"" as a prime free order option andwant Amazon to CLEARLY STATE= **SHIPPING FROM CHINA**",1
"I used to love Amazon and it used it almost daily to purchase items. I am a prime member but I find most prime items are more expensive. I dislike the ""add on"" only set up of items. I don't like the fact I have to pay separate subscriptions for each Alexa/echo  I have in my home. My deliveries always turn up on time and on the rare occasion I have had to return something it has always gone incredibly smoothly although I have read they will ban customers who return too many items which is slightly off putting. I like Amazon but just don't use it as much anymore as it is no longer competitive with its prices and I don't like feeling ""had"" with hidden fees. I won't be renewing my prime membership.",1
Just to let you know that you are Amaz(o)ng,2
"Been shopping on Amazon for some time now...items are delivered most of the time in a timely manner. However, sometimes the packages are lost on the way and Refund take ages..",1
"Amazon is just too convenient.  The prices are hit or miss, but sometimes it's worth a little extra for the convenience of ordering an item right then and there without having to leave the house, or make a list and remember to pick it up later.  There have been some times where I have gotten an item only to find out it wasn't what I thought it would be, or wasn't as high quality as it should be, but Amazon makes returning an item really easy, so it's not much of a risk.  Prime is a great deal, considering you get free one to two day shipping on the vast majority of items they sell, PLUS you get access to Amazon Prime Video (and Amazon Music, although I have never used it).  I order from Amazon several times every week, which is probably the biggest negative - it's easy to spend a lot without realizing it because it's so easy!",2
They have the worst shipping and they don't care at all about how they place your purchase in the box and offer nearly zero protection inside the box.,0
Great company to work for. Well organized. Uses modern computer software. Competitive pay. Safe work environment. Comfortable work environment.,2
A waste of money i got a membership and i never used it and wanted to cancel because When i did finally place a prime order the package was delivered a week later why am i paying $59 for a membership and you deliver my order as if im not then they tell me i can get a partial refund because i placed an order already. Not to mention what i order was kids multivitamin and they were expired that’s disrespectful this is for a child and you send it expired and the item was sold and shipped by amazon so they have no excuse about another merchant making a mistake. Then hungup in my face when i was nothing but cordial the superviser said i have other customers and hungup. Dont order from them just go to the store on your own!!!,0
I dont want to make it long but they sent my order late. I wasn't expecting amazon does this,1
"Won't honour their own prices. I've been a big customer for years. Today I closed my membership. An item I bought, in sale, was £140 less hours later. I asked for a refund (before it was delivered) and was told that they don't price match. I did say, its only price matching with yourself.I needed the item urgently for work so couldn't return and reorder, which is weirdly what they said that I could do???? Just refund the difference. They wouldn't so I won't be a customer again. Weird policy. It meant that I don't feel like a valued business customer.",1
"No angry hate words but I was one of their biggest fan until they slowly became bad in every way, Where do I start! Morning away from away professional shipping companies and start their bad shipping Service, I lost many shipments, many came late, some got delivered to my neighbors, kids in U-Haul Vans ! Amzel ! Just bad.And if you’re not happy with the product or the service, you can’t leave reviews like before! You can’t say it’s late! Or didn’t arrive ! They have new policy that takes away that right from you, their main focus is on profit, then more profit, and without premium good luck getting your items shipped! honestly it’s much faster ordering them from any website than amazon, and that’s not even half what I don’t like about them .... leaving Amazon for good after long years of a loyal premium member...",0
"God... no comments. I made a very expensive purchase on Amazon from an original brand seller. In the end, I received a very used item, you could tell by many aspects. So Amazon offered me a return, but for some magical reason I couldn't bring it to my local Amazon fresh, but only Ervi, and that's it, from the 28th of Jan, my nightmare started. Ervi provided me with a receipt with an invalid tracking number, so neither I nor Amazon couldn't locate the parcel. At least at Ervi, you are talking to real robots, at Amazon you are talking to humans which are worst than robots. For almost 3 weeks, I was receiving misleading information that I am either getting a refund today, tomorrow I am not receiving it, contact Ervi, I have to wait 14 days and will get a refund, and in the end no, bla bla bla. Not only that people at Amazon are either rude or using pre-copied text messages. I even visited the shop where I dropped the parcel and a lady managed to get through to Ervi, Ervi couldn't locate it and said to contact Amazon. Amazon on that day told me 2 things, first get in contact with Ervi, report it as lost and we will give you a refund, second 14 days passed you will not get a refund. Hahahahha, my IQ dropped during these conversations dramatically. Thankfully, I have a proper bank, so I made a report and my bank will be dealing with these m*r*ns at Amazon. I am a customer of Amazon since 2017, and only after the pandemic, I started experiencing worse and worse deliveries in general. Either I am receiving used or broken things, or my parcels are simply lost. Amazon, Ervi, DPD you name it, deliveries are getting so much worse, it is better to get it by yourself.",0
"There is a little too much things on amazon to where you can easily get scammed. Other people might not think this, but I've got scammed on almost half of my orders and I have almost 100 orders on amazon.",1
Scammers them Amazon people are held my item for over year when I sent it back no contact or refund untill I contact them year later scammers Customer services terbbile hard to get money don't trade with bad company it's all about money to them not you avoid  like the plaque,0

very haapy w all of my amazon purchases.,2
"Amazon constantly surprises me with what they stock, often selling items I would never have thought! You call trawl the web but more often than not Amazon's prices will not be beaten, especially considering their free, and speedy delivery. Simple to use and great value.",2
"A so-so usage, the shipper never called me when they didn't meet me so many times they dropped the package outside the door, never cared that the properties inside are expensive or not.",1
"They messed up my orders and I kept having to cancel and reorder because they never came on time anymore, and I ended up waiting 4 to 6 business days for a refund. Amazon is a joke. I'm losing trust in their reviews and systems.",0
"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
"This is a pretty long story but TLDR; returned faulty iMac to Amazon using my own chosen courier after they refused to arrange a collection - now have both my item and funds and are refusing to refund me.A while back I purchased an iMac however as it was faulty, I requested a return. Amazon refused to pick up the package and would only help me out if I used my own courier. I arranged a UPS collection from my house and Amazon then refunded me for my shipping after providing them with my shipping invoice which also included tracking number. The item was returned to Amazon a day after it was collected from my address so after chasing up multiple times (one day I was literally transferred to 7 agents and then eventually a ‘manager’ who was unable to provide me with a resolution as I didn’t have a collection receipt - I was never told I needed to provide this and UPS never handed a collection receipt over to me upon pickup, as the tracking was provided I didn’t understand why this was needed also. After even more back and forth I was told to wait 14 days and that I wouldn’t need to wait any longer… 14 days passed no refund no update but received multiple emails saying my refund was processed and then other emails saying it would be processed etc etc… After even more correspondence I have been told to wait up to 30 days which is almost up as of next week and still no sign of a refund. The situation has made me feel physically Ill as I doubt I will be getting me refund and nobody is willing to help me. I’m out of 1,200 as well as an iMac.Worst experience ever - not sure if these reviews are anonymous but any advice on how I can get my refund or take legal action would be appreciated. Disgusting service.",0
"I always use Amazon to do my online shopping, they are just great. The website is user friendly, they have a great selection of articles, very reliable, and I feel safe shopping with them.",2
Service & delivery is consistently amazing -- it's pretty impressive.,2
They have the worst customer service ever. Order a pc case on the 28th says over night shipping gets delayed a day. Then I get it and it's broken and they refused to refund it after about 10 people they finally decided since the panels are glass and were broken but the frame is still okay I could get a return. I set it to have it go to my Amazon account so I could repurchase a different case. I got a email saying the item was picked up.  But no money went into my account.  I called them and they said it was going back on my debit card and now couldn't change it since it was already being done with.  I said how Is it my fault you guys put the return wrong after them literally repeating it would go into my Amazon balance but then them not doing.  The lady then proceeded to say it's not our fault you messed up.  I explained why I wanted it on my account and proceeded to make excuses on why they messed up and put it on my card. Then said It would take 14 days to swap the return label so it could go on my account I said never mind DONT change anything I will deal with the 3 days to my card instead.  Then I got a email 5 minutes after the like 15th call that they were going to start the label swap process which would take 14 to 30 days.  I called them back got a lady name Dany who was no help at all and did not listen or understand what I was saying. Then I got a guy who was super good and said the person who sent that email must've been trying to get under my skin. Cause he saw the email saying the relabeling process would start and would be changed to go onto my amazon balance after me telling them never mind leave it. And he said I see that message but it was never changed so whoever sent the email was trying to upset you.  Worst customer service ever now I will not be able to order my new pc case for 3 to 5 more days. 10 days after it being ordered.  They would my offer any compensation for the troubles they caused because my situation did not qualify. Like how does it not quality! They made it nothing but a problem with this whole order.  If I could leave negative stars I would I should have to speak to almost 20 people to get anything done,0
"Amazing service as always, thank you",2
This company is the worst company I've ever dealt with the delivery drivers are absolutely horrible they opened Mt front door and threw a parcel into my living room when I managed to get intouch with customer chat they kept ending the chat on me on purpose about 3 times they say that orders had been delivered when they hadn't they have left parcels in my bin when I've asked them not to they are a disgrace and want closing down,0
"I decided i will start having my parcels delivered to my fiancee's address because when I'm not there I have been receiving emails from Amazon saying they have left my parcels with a neighbour who has opened a parcel in the past who I said on the shipment instructions not to leave my parcels with and i told them to give it to s different neighbour if I wasn't in,my other neighbour gets the parcel off her but in future my parcels will be going to my fiancee's address, I can't deal with it anymore this person getting their hands on my parcels, apart from that they are a acceptable company.",1
What was needed was a birthday gift to a friend . He wanted a music column . Fortunately on GearBeste was a discount on this musical column . The quality of its sound for the money we are satisfied . Sending your order and shipment was fast . Thank GearBest and mail :),1
I ordered some engine oil on the 2nd of March 2020. Amazon took the money out on the 9th March 2020. I contacted the seller 7 times to cancel the order - I have not received any replies. Amazon said they would contact the seller - No replies. Today 27th March 2020 Amazon tell me I am not entitled to a refund - as I have paid nothing - so who took the money out of the account on the 9th March 2020. Sort yourselves out Amazon - you are wasting my time.Order no. 026-6212464-9017949,0
"I am so frustrated with Amazon! They keep increasing the annual cost for Amazon Prime and the service keeps getting worse and worse. I am sick and tired of them promising me that an item will be delivered by a certain date and failing to do so! If it is an item that you really need by a certain date it really puts you in a bind. Not only does it leave stuck without the item, but then when the item arrives too late, you have to deal with the hassle of returning it! They either need to start delivering items on time or compensate their customers for the inconvenience! I will not be renewing my Prime membership.",0
"Lately Amazon have got absurdly high prices on items and shipping, eg. Small animal treat 50gram pack $AU65. 00 plus $AU100. 00 Shipping cost, how can you justify that, plus if you want to buy multiple items it won't allow you.",1
"I am a customer for a few years now, i love their services.to put in mind their services in the US are much better, but as an international customer, I still have the best experience with shopping.I never returned anything, I never had a bad experience with them, and I never had a bad product.Their prices are kinda high with the shipping cost, but as a user, I don't order everything from them, I just order if I didn't find the item with my needs in my local stores if so they have everything from cheap and crappy to best quality.it's just your choice.",2
Very Good product,2
"I absolutely love Amazon and have been shopping with them for years, but I couldn't believe it when a Botabay Dog Stroller was bought as a gift for my ageing dog from my sister and the description states that it has a rear storage pocket, it doesn't!!! That was one of the main reasons it was purchased. My ageing dog loves it, but we are so disappointed. My sister spent over £205.00 on it.......how disappointing!!!",1
Earlier I was happy but this time my parcel come late and the item's price was a lot a bit high.,1

Excellent customer service . Easy to contact them . Their online chat service is very helpful and reliable with experienced staff who can always sort out any issues that I might have . Their contact services are 100percent more efficient than eBay who are impossible to contact right now . I know I can rely on Amazon at all times to help me sort out any issues and their staff are both experienced and friendly . I can honestly say that they have always helped me if I needed them too .,2
How are you I have a small business and I tried to list item for sale on Amazon it was big scam start from the  beginning you have to buy a barcode from company they deal with them Gs1 cost $250 for barcode to list an item you have to go through a lot of Hustle and unwelcome website and if you need help some agent from India or Philippine going to call you back after you send request email because no phone number to call but anyway I finished everything they say  provide them With my tax ID number and it's still not working I don't know why I believe they have the most stupid system in the world now to sell on Amazon you need to ship your product to their warehouse which required another company they provided to come and pick up your shipment which cost me a lot of money and another 10 days waiting with three different appointment and they never show finally they come add pick up my shipment and it's been 8 days and I don't know where is my product so stay away if you want to sell on Amazon stay away,0
"I love shopping with Amazon.com because they make it so easy, and I am always satisfied with everything I buy.  They also offer so much in the product line.  I really like the ability to purchase music through the Amazon MP3 and choose only the songs I want, and the Amazon Cloud is great!",2
Amazon delivery personnel have twice left my parcels in the public foyer area of my apartment block despite me giving specific delivery instructions NOT to do that. I intend to avoid purchasing from them in future.,0
"Worst company ever, you receive wrong orders most of the time, if not fake brands coming from strange countries. Also they indirectly subscribe you to their prime service without you acknowledging. And suddenly you receive a bill on your credit card that you never approved initially. Sneaky way to get your money.",0
"Usually good service and pricing. Had occasional issues but nothing major. I can recommend it to others for general merchandise. Had decent delivery made to South Africa. Once did lose on a product as I was told to send it back at my own cost, which is unreasonable and I didn't do.",2
"Wonderful platform, Brilliant assistance provider.  I’m a Fan and it’s worth every penny! Always receive items the next day. Very efficient! This is the only order assistance that I can count on as have been let down by others this Always.",1
"For the past few days a promotion had been popping up on my account, ""Save $15 with your first sign in on the app"". I have a Prime membership and consistently place orders on Amazon but through my regular browser so I proceeded to download the app. After downloading the app I add an item to the cart that meets their requirement of $30. However, the $15 are not automatically deducted off the total. So I decide to reach out to customer service through the available chat option only to be given the runaround.My first complain is that I switch off from a representative to representative. If you do not respond back within a minute or god forbid 2. You will have a new representative that will need to read the complete conversation to catch up.Then a representative decided to focus on whether I received an email with the promotion? In which I respond, it doesn't seem to me that I need one when the promotion clearly states, ""the eligible customers should have received this offer directly from Amazon through the Amazon website OR by email. My favorite was when a representative told me I was not eligible because unbeknownst to me. I downloaded the app already in March 2018. Yet, I have several emails from Amazon throughout the summer with a similar promotion asking me to download the app.I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from Amazon. I had a more serious matter  resolved with Best Buy resolved through chat in less than 8 minutes. While, I had close to a 4 hour conversation through chat with more than a handful of Amazon representative only for my time to be wasted. A representative finally informed me a complaint will be placed after over 3 hours of me speaking with representatives and that I would hear back in 48 hours. 4 hours later over six representatives later, my matter was never resolved. My household spends thousands every year through Amazon. Just for them to not be able to honor a $15 promotion they themselves promoted to me on my account. I hardly ever use promo codes when shopping on Amazon but if they will be promoting a discount for downloads of their app they should honor it. Amazon will surely be losing much business from our end and I will be doing my research in other websites now instead of immediately going through Amazon.",0
"Funny company, don't know how they got to be so big, or are they? Logged in as usual, placed some products in my cart as normal, paid what I had to pay, and rested I will get my products as any normal person. I Guess Amazon had other plans for me, like why should I benefit from their products, who am I to attempt buying from them, like what are my titles, and what's my social status to even dream about being their costumer. So, to resume the issue, I paid and waited, they sent me an email that there was a suspicious payment and they needed to look into it. Asked for more details and proof that I was the person paying with my own card. They've asked for the payment statement(which I couldn't see because the payment was pending on their side) Sent them all the proof and maybe even more than I should have, they got to me saying it's not enough. Got more info that I am the owner of the card from my payment provider, sent them that too, guess what... Got an email stating they must close my account and there is nothing else to be talked about hahahahahahahahahah ahahahaha ahhahahahGarbage company! I can't believe it! Good there are plenty of options out there, hope they go down soon like they deserve. Have a great day everyone! And remember, keep you mental health and money safe and stay away from Amazon.",0
i buy my entire life here! but who doesnt? :),2
"I use Amazon a lot. If a package is lost or extremely late I get a refund, and if it ends up arriving I still get to keep it. I do pay for prime but I'm thinking about stopping it because they keep trying to force me into a ""shipping day"" once a week. What's the point in paying for prime then because orders are free over $25(I think... It might be $50) I might as well add to cart until I have that amount.",2
Normally they are okay but ther seller account is a joke. I got charged 19p for I dont know what and just using it is a pain.,1

I used to be a prime number half of the stuff never was within two or three days it was the same difference as not being a prime member. Recently I purchased a couple of doorbell hardwired kids only one was delivered and I tried to get customer service to expedite shipping on the other one and they couldn’t do anything they said. My experience with customer service has been so poor enough times that I’m actually considering giving up Amazon altogether.,0
Refunds from Amazon. Twice a gift card never turned up for someone can only presume driver dishonest. Three times now I have been promised my money back but I am going round in circles trying to get it. Waste of space,0
"Amazon is ok, but their couriers are not.  I have had an A4 book folded in half to fit in a letterbox as they could not be bothered to knock on the door.  A package that was to fat to fit through letterbox was left poking out of the door.  Don't shop from them unless the item won't fit through the letterbox however much the lazy driver rams it.",1
"Got to say i love Amazon. No more going to town, paying for parking, speaking to useless staff in shop. Waiting weeks for delivery.£80 a year for next day delivery to my desk along with a TV subscription is great value.Never disappointed with Amazon, high street let me down time and again.",2

"I was awarded digital credits due to delayed shipping.  When I tried to use the credits they were not honored. Spoke with customer service and they were not very helpful.  Polite but uninformed. After sometime I was given codes so I could use my rewards, but the codes failed.  My 17.00 dollar digital credit was lowered 12.00 shopping credit by email. Tried to use 12.00 on several items, no luck.  Appears to be another bad credit.  Spoke with customer service again, unresolved.  Wasted time and became very frustrated trying to work with Amazon.  I hope to never pay this company another dime.  I plan to shop everywhere else not to support this behavior.",0
"Happy with the purchase I made but I don't like the offer and stuff of amazon prime, i don't like the idea.",1
Lately whenever I have placed order with Amazon fresh the people packing the orders have been very sloppy. Anything from flattened bread to wrong items in bag. The other day they totally sent me someone else order. Granted Amazon does give refunds or replacement items and thats decent. So why can't the people packing the orders get it right. This is time consuming and irritating for the customer.,1

We as a family love Amazon.Anything you want is there.A quick and easy way to shop.The prices are excellent and of course the choice of goods.My favourite gift I received for Christmas this year was a £50 Amazon gift voucher.I was in heaven.,2
It has become my go to place for all my shopping. I really am un-happy about the new tracking/targeting system. I feel that they are now charging me more for idem's that I may want. So I am now more careful about what I buy there and shop around more. I use to be a faithful Amazon shopper. Just a average management decision. Amazon has lost 40% of my business because of this. But they have lots of money... :),1
Amazon is a really great place to buy pretty much anything i have bought hundreds of items for myself and a fair few gifts ,2

"Used Amazon for more than 10 years. Most of the time, when goodss are sent, things go more or less as planned (often later than forecast shipment times).But... When something goes wrong, it is challenging to get hold of a human. When we finally reach someone, they do not have time and give you the runaround. Basically, whenever you need real support, there is none.For example (latest to date): ordered 10 automation devices. 2 were delivered. The last 8 to expect on 10-Aug. It is now 27-Aug and still no update. Finally reached someone and after lots of chatting, the staff stated ""It is stuck"" (no more explanation). ""You will get an e-mail when it is released..."" Unable to cancel the order either. So if I order again, I might end up with double the quantity one day.There are more examples. In each case, it took months to resolve.",1
"I placed a order,  it got delayed instead of waiting til the end of the week for me to call back as I asked they did a refund immediately! I ordered the same exact stuff again then the package showed up!! Called to cancel the order just placed and have them take the refund back!!! So I got get the one they found as I knew it would be found! At that time she put it in as refused, even though I wanted to cancel the new order and give the refund back!!! They lost a customer who was a avid Amazon Shopper who spends thousands of dollars a year!! Due to ppl not listening and providing crappy customer service!!!",0
"Mostly a fine usage, but after I made an order with one-day shipment that was due to arrive today by 8pm ran late, I contacted customer assistance to see what could be done. I spoke to two different representatives, and both said the same thing, that I must wait for the order to be dispatched, then another date can be rescheduled, ignoring the fact that I needed the item on the guaranteed date of shipment. One of the selling points of Prime membership being one-day shipment, I find myself questioning whether to continue my membership as this isn’t my first usage like this.",1
The baby registry on Amazon is easy to use and comes with the incredible selection that only Amazon seems to offer.  I have received two gifts of my registry so far and my welcome box which had fantastic samples and a few free size items such as rattles and a swaddle blanket.  I chose to register at Amazon as it is convenient for all my friends and family and very pleased with my choice.,2
"Amazon has gone downhill fast.  We have prime and pay a lot for it.  When we ordered we will have a delivery date, but you can’t go with that. All we can do is sit and wait to see if it shows up on time.   We are currently waiting on a item we purchased for my parents which was supposed to have been delivered on October 7th.  We checked to see the status to see if was delayed, it could be delivered either the 8th or 9th is October.  So we checked again today and it showed they tried to deliver it at 3:17 a m this morning (oct 8th).  Yes, it shows 3:17 am, they said they attempted to deliver and will have try again.  At this point I’m upset with amazon (this is not the only time this as happened).  I called today to get told “ sorry all we can at is they can’t find a driver to deliver it and it will be delivered as soon as they can). I lost it at his point and told them this is not acceptable.    I finally got to a supervisor who said she was sending a message to find out what was going on. She said we would hear something within 2 hours.  Well it’s been 5 hours and again nothing from amazon. No phone call, no message or package.    Buyer beware just because you have prime and pay a lot for it don’t mean you will receive your packages as they state when you purchase it.",0
I probably spend 100K a year+ here for my business.they keep trying to get me to have a business account but from what I was told it would nix the free shipping on a ton of items.. why would I do that? it just doesnt seem worth it.,1
"Amazon is a total joke. They delete my orders, I can't find them anymore and I can not make any returns either. I call customer service and the lady sounded like she had an Asian accent. I couldn't understand a single word she was saying and she seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. The other thing is that they happen to steal $100 from my account for Amazon Prime and temporarily disable my account. They wouldn't even let me cancel it.",0
"I have noticed the user interface for Amazon is HORRENDOUS!!! I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription which was so hard to get because you can't do it through the Amazon app or the KU app. I had to find a link through google...WHY SO HARD?? I also got a trial for Amazon music for a month which I cancelled. A few months later it AUTOMATICALLY took money out of my account for Amazon music. Why doesn't it ask you before it just takes money out. Any other place you buy things from it gives you a second to think before you actually get it, but no, not Amazon. WHY SO HARD??? I also tried to get my Amazon Prime Video on my phone which is under a different account but it will AUTOMATICALLY use the account all your other stuff is on but guess what. You can't just log out in one place. You have to  log out of EVERYTHING!! WHY SO HARD!!!! I'm surprised more people don't complain about this. Although Amazon offers a lot it is so difficult to manouver and actually find things through the apps that I keep having to ask google!! Pls hire a better IT team!!",0
Use all the time for purchasing books and movies - great resource - find other things - just about anything you can imagine here!,2
Super Slow Delivery... A bit disappointed,1
Very slow with shipment. Amazon Prime is not a acceptable deal either.,1
"I simply love Amazon, I have been a customer now for 3 years, I have bought a mixture of things, never had a problem and have been satisfied with their service, the prime is the best, get my goods next day, plus with my subscription I get prime video, music and free reads on books. I have found nearly everything I want on their site. From door locks, lighting, wallpaper, grass seed, bedding, towels to fashion and make up. Its just so super easy, everything is well packaged and I have never returned anything. I must have ordered more than 200 items so far, happy with them all. So keep up the good work x",2
"Amazon DecrepitudeI had trouble deciding whether to choose one or two stars for my review.In the past you could count on Amazon customer reviews to help you sort out whether a particular item was any good or not. Reviews would tell you about user experiences; how well the product worked, whether there were warranty claim issues, whether the item was suitable for a task, or even if a particular  vendor was untrustworthy or not.However, Amazon started adding Ratings which are not Reviews, simply some useless, lazy person simply giving stars (1-5) without any reason for the rating. Some products have tons of ratings without a single useful note giving a reason for the rating. This is especially infuriating when it comes to reviewing books. You click on what you think is a review and it turns out to be a rating, meaning there is no reason given for the star assignment. This is not very helpful to help you decide if you would be interested in purchasing a book.Later on Amazon removed all of the Comments that customers used to give additional information or commentary on a particular Review. This meant that warning about certain vendors failure to ship products on time, substituting products, shipping used items that were supposed to be new, or explaining why the negative review was a user caused, rather than a product problem.Removing the Comments on Reviews means that a TON OF HELPFUL information is gone resulting in the customer REVIEWS, are no longer as informative and helpful.Of course the worse thing that Amazon had done starting at least 10 years ago is that they lump reviews of different products together, presumably to make it appear that there are more reviews than actually exist. Whenever you purchase an product, you are invited, and encourage to leave a review, which is tied to the purchase of the exact item you purchased so there is no reasonable excuse for claiming that it is hard to connect the review to the exact item purchased. Amazon has all of the data that is needed to do this right.One terrible example of product Review LUMPING are those for Computer Hard Drives (HDs). Amazon lumps the reviews for old generation small capacity 500 Gb HDs, with all hard drives   made by a particular manufacturer with the largest capacity 18TB HDs. Now, the lower capacity HDs were designed and manufactured many years ago, using very different designs and components than those  newest, ultra high capacity HDs. These newest HD's that are very different from the older HDs, and use components that were produced most recently. We know that batches of components of the same design made at different times in factories may have quality control issues, hence Amazon's LUMPING practice defies reason and is DISHONEST.  Amazon will no doubt claim that their filtering menu takes care of this issue, but in fact that is false. You cannot evaluate the percentage of negative reviews (such as adding the two lowest star ratings together) without having these required data easily available. These are not easily found without counting every review. I certainly do not have time to do that, nor should that be required of anyone wanting to understand the review ratings. This would not be a problem if products that are not identical were not LUMPED together.LUMPING is misleading, and seriously dishonest, making it extremely difficult to make choosing a reliable product from Amazon. This practice should certainly stop, and the Review Comments should be put back if possible, and certainly re-instated.I have complained vigorously with customers support and even tried contacting Amazon upper management without success. Do away with LUMPING and get rid of Ratings instead of having Reviews! What will it take to get Amazon to fix these issues ?",0

"Instead of going to the supermarket, now I can get everything from home. The shipping is fast, only 2 days with Prime.",2
"Honestly, noo too average no too fine, is fine",1
"I am getting frustrated , I make purchases through Amazon for convenience and based on order times & dates and I do not think that Amazon sellers nor Amazon as a retail venue should advertise they can deliver ""same day"" , ""next day"" or even ""Prime order"" when they CANNOT fulfill the transaction according to the terms when the item(s) were ordered . This happens more times than not , it's aggravating and that is the point of this review !",1

"I have been with amazon since 2009 and have been buying a whole lot stuffs from it and mostly satisfied with. It is not anymore. I recently ordered a lot of things from this platform too. However, many of my ordered have been canceled with the same reason which says “cannot delivered/have problem with order”. All the canceled orders sold by amazon and a US based company. Not any orders sold by China based has been canceled. What happened to Amazon? Is it a China Company now? I am so disappointed and frustrated.",1
"They are good but not excellent, deliverys are MOSTLY ontime and some products are OVERPRICED.",2
I use this site everytime. Recomand,2
"While somethings are fine on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their order drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything ordinary they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1
They always have great selection. Customer service is great!,2
I absolutely love Amazon prime the addition of movies  and next day delivery on thousands of products is incredible sometimes I would sooner wait for the delivery man to arrive the next morning or afternoon than queue in a store. its the future of shopping,2
I really do love Amazon!,2
"I have nothing bad to say about Amazon.com.  I have a prime membership which means that for about $80/year, I and 4-5 other family members have free 2-day shipping for an entire year.  You can see that if you divide that fee between everyone, that it becomes quite reasonable.  I have a Kindle, and I absolutely love it - I no longer have to find more bookshelving for my expanding library.  Amazon is a real winner!!!",2
All my products from amazon arrived really quick and ive had no issues.,2
A useful marketplace with huge range of products.,2
If you want something look at Amazon first they've got it or can get it!,2
"I decided to download amazon back to see if anything change since I could not find the item in the state I live in, I spent over $218.64 just to get the items from Amazon and there telling me they have my order on hold because they can't confirm it was me what? How the hell do you not know it's your own customer buying from you! You've even become more dumber and stupider than last time when I dealt with you last year! It's been four days and they still have my order on hold.. once it's not on hold anymore I'm canceling my order and deleting my amazon account for good this time, never will use you them again I swear amazon is so backwards. Avoid amazon and steer away from them at all cost they've gone downhill big time.",0
"Over priced items are cheaper on eBay, order was not on time and was done through Prime trial. Products are not free order because special order is 'then added at checkout' which makes it dubious to reconcile. 😒",1
"I mean it's really not that ordinary. Although I usually just get a free trial, and order something once a year. But when I do the goods is decent. ",1
"They continue to change the shipping date of my packages both before and after the purchase when I by clothing. It is irritating because it leaves me with nothing to wear when they do that. I have to repeat dirty clothing because they keep over promising. I keep thinking they'll improve, but they don't.",0
"Terrible customer service from Amazon. I bought a Nadalan Freesat box on Amazon.  It will only pick up a few channels and not  most of the major channels.  I have a different make of Freesat box working in a different room but from the same dish and that works fine so I know the Nadalan box is the issue.  As the item did not work and is functionally virtually useless, I sought to return it.  Every time I attempt to print a return label via the Amazon website, I get an error message and that they were attempting to sort this out.  I called Amazon and they said they would sort this out.  5 days later and the issue persists.  I was told they would e-mail a return label and Amazon have failed to do so.  I received an e-mail saying they would phone back the following day and they did not do so. I can only conclude that they have lost interest and by adopting such a poor and unhelpful stance they hope they will not have to deal with the issue.",0
I have always found Amazon to have excellant customer service.Any time if I have had an issue with anything they are straight on it.If I ever need to speak to anyone online always very happy to help.For me this is important and that’s why I shop at Amazon online.,2
I received my order very quickly and accurately. I will absolutely use Amazon again.,2
"I placed a order,  it got delayed instead of waiting til the end of the week for me to call back as I asked they did a refund immediately! I ordered the same exact stuff again then the package showed up!! Called to cancel the order just placed and have them take the refund back!!! So I got get the one they found as I knew it would be found! At that time she put it in as refused, even though I wanted to cancel the new order and give the refund back!!! They lost a customer who was a avid Amazon Shopper who spends thousands of dollars a year!! Due to ppl not listening and providing crappy customer service!!!",0
Always good experiences. Whenever bad their customer services sorts it out :) just wish prime was cheaper,2
"I have been shopping with Amazon for a few months and I am very satisfied with the outcome. The last of orders were in early December and I purchased their waterproof bulb, shower curtain and led lights. The quality is great for all the products and I am also enjoying their Amazon prime benefits.",2
"OMG my credit card has been hacked and the details have come through Amazon. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CARD DETAILS ON AMAZON make single payment or don’t use Amazon go else ware. You have been warned. There will be payments taken out of your account by third parties all be it only small amounts but they will empty your account once two payments have been taken so check your bank account NOW !!! to see if they have done this, here are two companies to be vigilant about! BATEAUX PARIS- and -PEAK TRAMWAYS CO…… please take note. They will clean you out. !!!!!!",0
"Prices are still fine but support going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer support and not just 'cheapest'.",1
love using amazon. we got rid of prime but still order all the time. decent.,2
Amazon is the best online shopping site.  Become a prime member and get fast free shipping.  The wide selection and competitive prices coupled with the fast free shipping make it a no brainer to order on Amazon.,2
"I have barely used Amazon, made some orders more than one year ago.. However someone hacked my account and made an upgrade to premium also started to do some shopping, luckily i didnt had funds on the card so it wasnt processed. They emailed me telling me that they have blocked my account as they noticed unusual activity and to try and reset my password in about 2 h. Fair enough... Days have passed and i still couldn't reset my password.. Kepping asking me for an otp which never came. Called them too while struggling with this and the said that will keep not allow any activity to take place from my account and cancel the premium... Well.. One month later i got charged and still no access on my account and i can not verify my account as the dude who hacked it changed the address and the support lady kept asking me to verify my address.... HOWWW??? I told her every possible address i could have had ordered from and aparently she said that it is not from my country...asked about a refund on the upgrade and to close the account..she told me to apply for charge back.. Basically nothing was possible as i couldnt enter my account and i ended up making charge back and cancelling my card as no other friendly way to do it..verry disappointed on the quality of support, considering the size of the company... Oh.. One thing she told me.. In order to cancel this account i have to create another one with the sane email... Is that even possible???",0
"Amazon has certain pluses about it, but like many large companies they tend to overlook customer assistance. I waited 1 1/2 weeks for a replacement item before I called them only to find out they forgot to send it. Really? How does this even happen?",1
"Purchase an item on the 24th aug 2023 , item was being sold by Amazon eu and advertised as in stock at time of sale . After sale I was informed delivery time to be confirmed. Nearly every day since purchase item has been advertised as in stock by Amazon eu . After contacting Amazon I was informed that the item was not in stock and also told that (in stock ) does not mean the item is in stock . Hear is what happened on 11/8/23 , the item said 13 in stock and while speaking the phone a Amazon advisor was able to tell me that there was now only 12 available while we were speaking, I asked the advisor could I not have one of the 12 and was told that is not how it works (lol) . So I pay for the item and Amazon won't deliver it but won't deliver it when it is clearly in stock and can't provide a delivery date . So if you see a item you like and is in stock, understand that the term (in stock ) written on a advertisement on Amazon platform does not actually mean (in stock) and what it does mean is very unclear.",0

I just don’t like about amazon is the customer cares just one thing. Always when the Usps fails on the day they supposed to deliver and they don’t. Why in the world like a customer do I have to call and fix it ? I’m paying for the support . They have to contact the postal office and fix it . That is why I’m paying for that support btw is not cheap . “Amazon prime”  I hope they can do something about it,1
Had a nice experience buying ,2
"I think there is a tendency only to provide experiences when you are frustrated and angry. So I thought for a few seconds about who had impressed me most. And I would say these guys. I am talking about the ease of buying products which I started to do at the start of the pandemic. Everything about this platform is fantastic. I can spend 30 min wandering around hardware stores to find some obscure screw, and probably fail, but I can identify it on Amazon and it'll be here next day most of the time.I've never had cause to complain and cannot judge customer service too well as a result, but I'm around 100 orders now and no issues, so what can you do other than give 5 stars?",2
On chat for an hour or more every time even for the simplest requests. Constantly having to repeat yourself drivers don’t follow simple instructions delivery's not turning up its ridiculous its never been so bad time to find somewhere different to shop,0
"Amazon is big for a reason. You can pretty much find anything you need here, and get a killer deal. With the Markeplace guarantee, you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter. Comforting when ordering from around the world. I rely on Amazon for household goods, electronics, camera equipment, shoes and clothing, books, and entertainment, everything but husband.",2
"Amazing, fast delivery. Love prime feature, very money worth since it also gives access to free tv shows, movies and extra features on alexa, next day delivery and more. Always use amazon for it's swift delivery and good quality products.",2
My husband’s to go place for everything every thing gets here so fast in Arizona. It is insane. It’s very reliable and it’s very quickly so it is our place to shop when we need stuff ASAP.,2
"My package said delivered but it was nowhere to be found. This has happened before, which is extremely frustrating as I had left detailed instructions on where to leave the package. They were helpful in refunding me which was very kind, however, I think they need to have better communication with their shipping entities.",1
"I recently gave Amazon a bad review, it was somewhat reluctant. I had an adverse purchase through Wholesale Hunter, a dreadful company by the way. What is to.be learned is if a purchase is not directly from Amazon, a third party seller situation. We the buyer should practice caution, if anything does not seem square with that third party seller, then keep looking. Sometimes a stinker sneaks through, so beware. Amazon's strongest asset is their employees, like many companies. All the customer service people I dealt with recently did a great job overall, Amazon is beyond lucky to have them. I also wish for healing for the employees lost in the recent storm/warehouse, and their families.",2
Last year I ordered some jewelry and when I got the package the necklace and braclets were broken. Contact the seller through Amazon and the company that sold them to me said keep them and promptly rushed a new set to me.,2
Terrible!! Was due a delivery with prime a week ago. The morning of delivery my account orders changed to undeliverable as damaged in transit and a refund will be given. One item from the package was returned the next day and I got a refund but 3 items are ‘missing’ and now I have to wait 14 days for a refund! Customer service is not acceptable and been told different things. First to wait to the 30th then the 11th august. Was told someone would contact me within 24hrs but they never did! It’s beyond a joke. Quick enough to take the money! Last person I spoke to said they can see its transit and will issue a refund after the 11th. Why? Why can’t they give me refund if they know it’s being sent back ! Personally I think one of the drivers has stolen my items! How does one item return back to Amazon the next day but the other 3 items haven’t almost a week one! It’s ridiculous.,0
"I wasn't too happy when they completely ""banned"" sales of Confederate Flags. There is still a large market in sales for this kind of stuff. Whether people agree with it or not. You will always have someone that agrees, as well as disagrees. If you guys decided to ban a piece of American history, then you should ban the sales of Soviet Flags as well. As this flag and its representation goes contrary to how this country was founded. Could be considered very offensive as well amongst many Americans far and wide. This is the United States of America we should have the freedom to chose what we want to buy. I'm sick of businesses going along with this government that thinks they can dictate our lives. I think this was a total mistake Amazon. I hope my opinion is considered.",1
Didnt like the usage with the seller,1
"Love how convenient Amazon is, and especially their Prime support. In the rare instance I get sent the wrong or damaged goods they are always quick to fix it...However, they do seem to have dubious business practices, undercutting other companies on their website etc, and dont have a strong employment record for their warehouse workers (I am sure their technical and business side have acceptable working conditions and compensation) which is a shame.",1
"Wonderful platform, Brilliant support provider.  I’m a Fan and it’s worth every penny! Always receive items the next day. Very efficient! This is the only shipment support that I can count on as have been let down by others this Always.",1
Have put one star back for Clarissa the only agent who cared and wanted to make things right. After id been online constant for over 4hours being palmed off to next agent she pleaded with me to stay on and she would make it right. So took 5 hours in total but she did true to her word as I found on waking up this morning so she deserves a raise but the rest of the team CS And Co can rot. And I've well and truly been put off buying other items I had intended too Awful customer support with foreign call centres and chat finally corrected by a Amazing clarissa as stated above after a very long time of needing help,1
"Amazon customer service can never seem to give the same answer more than once. I work for an apartment complex that the drivers can never deliver to the correct address (one would think you must be able to read to deliver packages).  I have tried to have packages picked up for that don't live hear any more 1 customer service rep saide they would call back with someone to pick it up and never called back the 2nd person said that couldn't be done, just keep the package. This is a billion dollar business that they can not even have people trained is the same manner. If anyone else in the really world would do this they would be fired or the business would be shut  down.",0
Very slow still waiting for a package to be delivered from usa to berlin!!,1
"I would give 5 stars and here’s why I’m not. I’ve been using amazon for several years now and they have been great! Especially with prime. Now, here recently they have started delivering packages with their blue or white vans. Every since they started,  I’ve had quite a few issues! I’ve have packages that never showed and had to end up getting my money back or have them resend it. Claiming that my house was not accessible! I’ve been staying here for over a year and NEVER have I had an issue until they started using the random people in these vans! I checked videos from the cameras around my house and it showed where these people are throwing my packages!! I wish I could post the videos!!! Come on amazon you have to do better!",1
"Amazon has great prices, and there is no end to what you will find to fit your needs, however, I cannot always trust the sellers. Amazon leaves it up to the customer to research their sellers to find out if they are legitimate and follow fine business practices. They also do a terrible job with packaging their orders. I received an order of 3 reams of copy paper that was put in this giant box that would be suited for a huge picture frame. The reams of paper slid all around inside and the goods packing was all tore up. The paper was a mess! Amazon packaging is also very wasteful. I once received 3 little packs of Name averagege stickers in a box a little bigger than a shoebox! For a company that makes the billions it does, you think they could afford to research, review, and oversee the quality and legitimacy of their sellers in real time.",1
"I recieved a bunch of condolence flowers recently which was wonderful but no note of whom they were from apart from amazon business so contacted delivery company told have to go to amazon, so contacted amazon cust service told cant tell u, what a crock amazon are we only wanted to thank whomever sent flowers to be told data protection prohibits,Glad i never use amazon myself ebay much easier to use.",0
"Everytime I look for something in particular, I always check in amazon.com, even if it's something I found on a retail shop, because the most of the times it's cheaper. You can find really big deals in there. Anyway I like to compare different prices and references, but this one might be my favourite, I guess.",2
I am a regular customer with Amazon every delivery turns up on time and any issues I have customer service are very quick and helpful to resolve the issue ￼,2
no problems here,1
"I found that some of the companies didn't export to ROI but they did not tell me this until I had all my credit card details given. I think that this should have been pointed out when I first put the items in the ""basket"" Otherwise very happy with the support",1

"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience. I don't know seller, if he is not responding you, I bought it because of your trust, Order number :- 403-3552607-1022716Deepak #amazon #onlineshopping #scammersALERT #amazonsale #amazondeals #AmazonCustomer #amazoncheat",0
I've had a refund in limbo for a macbook pro for a month and support has been useless and even hung up on me after refusing to tell me their full name.  It should be illegal to hold on to such a large amount of money for so long.  I still have no idea when or if my refund is going to be processed.  I've been an amazon customer since 2002 and the quality of their product has been in constant decline the last few years.,0
I have been lucky enough to never have an issue with my orders. Always arrive on time and un-damaged maybe we just have a very careful warehouse and drive team nearby ,2
I ordered something off amazon but the money was took out and didn’t get a confirmation email or anything,0

"I love Amazon, for the supports they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the goodss or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' usages. Typical corporate America. No matter how many decent things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
"They always deliver, and for any issues, they make it right.   Amazon fan.",2
Good and easy returns,2
"I have bought SO many things from Amazone and they have been delivered fast and in good condition. I love Breyer model horses, and Amazone has lots! Great company.",2
"I've used 20£ gift voucher code and Amazon has blocked my account asking to provide a purchase receipt for the gift card, spoke to the customer service twice, explained it was a gift, so no receipt is avalable, provided with a screenshot of social media where the code from my friend was received, no result, they keep sending me the same request and wont unblock my account until receipt is received, also emailed the customer relationship team, total ignorance. Thought Amazon was a decent company, can see now how I was wrong, disgusting how they treat their customers. What is more they keep charging me for Amazon Prime despite they don't let me use my account. Unbelievable!!!",0
Love the fact that you can order something and get it the next day.,2
"No matter what I need, or the desire of my heart, I can typically find it at a great price on Amazon. I love the addition of Prime Shipping, and love that I can receive my orders within two days of ordering! I've purchased hundreds of items across a myriad of departments on Amazon, and have never EVER had an issue with returning an item that didn't fit or was not as described. I'm so grateful for Amazon, and recommend my friends and family to shop on Amazon for all their online shopping needs. Years ago, I used to shop on eBay, and found that the whole auction thing was actually kind of fun. However, I ended up having issues with fraud in my PayPal account, and realized that this would continue so long as I was forced to use a middleman to complete my online purchases. With Amazon, there is no middleman and never has been any fraud in my debit account that can be traced back to an Amazon purchase. They're very protective of their customers' financial information, and refunds are quick and easy. I will never, EVER shop eBay again, especially in light of how many scammers are starting to infest eBay's sellers market. It's really too bad that eBay doesn't do as good a job at protecting their customers as Amazon does. Thank you Amazon for being so awesome!",2
"I am published author on Amazon, check my books and thank you Amazon for creating such platform.",2
"As of today these thieves have not refunded my money! Forget Amazon! Besos is a crook! Still hasn’t arrived. Status on Amazon says “delivered”, however they explained that when it arrives in the US it’s in delivered status. They claim 48 hours from today or a refund. Some of the vendors they use 🤬! Especially the vendors in china. Placed order on August 6 for an NFL blanket-still hasn’t arrived! Shop around. I make most of my purchases outside of Amazon. This vendor is Custom Shop Gift!?! Sounds like 🤬",1
Late delivery it's been 3 weeks but Amazon told me it will be delivered in a day,0
Amazon has stopped 2 day order in my area. Ridiculous why even get prime at this point?,1
"It's OK, but you're just giving Bezos more money.",1

"The go to place for pretty much anything.I am a so called ""prime member"". Over the years their deliveries have gotten worse in my usage and items were being sent out but delivered to the wrong places without any attempts being made to deliver to me first even though I was home.Customer support is actually pretty quick and reachable. Very customer centric but there are, at times, moments when you have to push your complaints further. For example for damaged items that no one comes to collect? Communication between them: make sure you check on the status of your complaints because sometimes they cannot update things properly and you may end up being charged for something you were supposed to return and no one came to collect so they told you to dispose of it.",1
"Android App.  ADD ""Sort Price: Low to High""You do a great job of offering your customers' many useful options, a thinly veiled effort to increase your bottom line.  Add this feature to your Android App (""items under $25"" is very far from Sort Price: Low to High) and your customers will increase your bottom line even more. Thank you",1
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day order and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after prices were raised and prices are higher than in stores already. Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1
My son ordered a gaming monitor £169 and instead received a watch £30. He had signed for it because you need a code now for anything over £100. We returned the watch and have now had a gaming monitor delivered 5times! They won’t leave it because we have no code which was supposed to be sent but never received for the replacement. Customer service appalling! Now waiting for a refund 🤞🏻all because someone can’t be bothered to send a simple replacement code.,0
Prime is really great always getting deals and steals,2
Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy,2
Amazon always delivers what I order correctly and quickly!,2
"Been a customer for few years and as time goes on I'm reminded why I was hesitant to create an account.  Don't get me wrong they have loads of brands, variety, and prices many times are better than the seller's own website's but all fine things on the surface have hidden costs. More than half the time order days change often without any explanations. Once I received a completely different goods than I ordered and couldn't get the proper goods from that seller so had to go through similar items to find a more pricey deal anyways. They did gift card the price but many times I've received items that barely resemble the ad and certainly weren't the quality the reviews said so it makes you wonder how do they stay on top? IMO humans are lazy, we don't want to have to go to five stores to get five types of things combined with free shipping that only seems free. I would also guess Amazon knows what other mega stores online or not do:you don't need the best quality if you have enough items just a bit cheaper than the competition and become a one stop shop. Ultimately my choice to go with Amazon for goodss, or not, isn't likely to change their business model as look at their profits year over year. But that's just one opinion among hundreds of millions and I've usaged some sellers that have quality goodss and they probably want a piece of the $$$ that comes with being connected to the fifth largest company worldwide, I can understand that. Good luck, read reviews and log every order. ",1
"Excellent customer service, they care about the customers. I've been an Amazon customer for 10 years.",2
Often a lot of items for a better price than otherwhere. Multiple Payment methods. Unfortunately a few redtricted goods categories. Sometimes out of stock,1
"I ordered a Nintendo switch game, ended up with the wrong game. Contacted customer service and got connected to the RUDEST employee I’ve ever encountered. Didn’t even offer to let me return my game for it to be replaced with the game that I wanted in the first place. Ended up having to return it for a refund, and am now having to reorder the game in the hopes that the game I wanted in the first place will turn up.",0
The customer service is appalling refuse to help and when you want to put forward about a complaint they refuse and don’t give any emails or numbers to put a complaint in its disgusting the way they treat customers one of the worst experiences I have had,0
The delivery driver left the parcel at our front door whilst we were out but claimed to hand it to the customer. captured on security camera. Our front door is 3 feet away from the main pavement. Unable to report it to Amazon. If it had been stolen we would have no proof and unable to get a refund.,0
"You can get acceptable customer support and order if you do not wish to venture outside. However, the high street prices in comparison are often much cheaper.",1
Very good company I like everythink about the company support and service and delivery was really fast.,2
"2 major gripes.1. I have Prime but when i put a goods in my cart the order date always changes,obviously a few days after that stated on the goods page. 2 They should have told me before i returned Everything that you're supposed to keep the charger and accessories.now i have a lonesome Echo Dot and ha ve to buy a charger separatel ly.",1

I shouldn’t take 3 days to prepare a order to ship I’ve never seen such a slow an a business that don’t care about there customers time to step up a few levels Amazon an customer service.,0
"Ordered a product which did not indicate there would be duty charges, when product was delivered $61.00 in duties had to be paid.This is misleading to the consumer, and guess this is how Amazon rips off customers.Contacted Amazon Customer support, they indicated to send the Duties invoice to cs-reply @amazon.caand after doing so, now they are indicating to contact someone else.So the round and around starts so Amazon doesn't take ownership on ripping off customers.This department ...acc-global @amazon.ca is useless and just wants to get rid of you. Basically go away and contact another department.Now I know how Amazon has so much money Ripping us off",0
"I've had an average interaction with Amazon.com. The site offers a vast selection of items, and it's generally easy to find what I'm looking for. However, there have been a few instances where the shipment was delayed, which was quite frustrating.The customer support is decent, but there have been times when resolving issues took longer than expected. Prices are usually competitive, but occasionally I find better deals elsewhere. Overall, Amazon.com is convenient for many purchases, but there is definitely room for improvement in their shipment and customer support supports.",1
"No one is perfect but Amazon has always fixed any issue I have with them.  From refunds to replacements to Prime, this company is superb!  Trustpilot needs some more good reviews too when people are satisfied so here is one for Amazon!",2
Absolutely rubbish still waiting on Xmas presents and other orders not turning up,0
Never had any problems getting my products + they are very cheap and arrive very fast,2
they are awsome . great staff,2
I love shopping at Amazon...but don’t try to contact them..I got a scam call today saying a charge of over $700 was being added to my account..I tried comtacting Amazon with their form..”call me”...that didn’t happen...”chat with advisor” ...couldn’t do that either..no shows..they are decent at collecting the money but customer support...no show.  So disappointing..not that they care...too busy raking the cash in.  Not the first time ...I should have known not to waste my time.,1
I used to shop a lot from amazon but lately I do not like their order any more.,1
It takes you too much time to send me 1 lousy book! I'm wating for over a month now!,1
I use aws services of Amazon. Its really outstanding.,2
"Received my item in the poorest state I’ve ever received in item in - product, box the product came in and the shipping box all broken and crushed. I contacted customer support and explained that I purchased it as a Father’s Day present and couldn’t afford to wait for a time to return myself and then wait for the refund to buy a new present. I also explained that my dad is in hospital and I was going to surprise him with the gift. Customer support was unsympathetic and condescending. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and got through to Omkar. Total waste of time. Not only did he just recycle the same washed out responses I’d already received (clearly copy and paste), he was unhelpful and condescending to my situation. Telling me “we will investigate this issue to make sure it doesn’t happen again”, how does that help in this particular situation? Baffled if I’m honest. Won’t be ordering again as the customer service and delivery is awful.",0
"I would give a 0 star if I could. Amazon used to be great. You'd get same day delivery and 2 day shipping. Now items take a week or longer to get to you. We are paying for a service were not getting.  Customer service is terrible. They used to offer credits for your inconvenience or for an item not getting to you when it was supposed to, but  now they do not offer that nor do they even care if they lose their customers.",0
"Reliable, get what you order, no problems",2
"Experience with Amazon has always been great. However, that was until they started shipping their own.  Now almost everything that is supposed to be a day or two with my prime membership, is almost never on time, and we're left waiting...

Hi guys I'ma famous YouTuber and instagramer and I could help review your items,2
My order arrived over a week late after paying for next day order. Disappointed as I needed it for a gift that weekend :’(,1

Ordered 4 prime items. Needed today. 2 delivered but in my safe space although I was home!!! 2 apparently unsuccessful delivery as I wasn’t in. Oh yes I was. Idiot forgot them and most probably couldn’t be bothered to come back. I’m fuming as they were birthday presents. Disgusted with Amazon. Really gone downhill!!!,0
"Send packages usually never broken, most I’ve gotten are decent quality they seem to be very quick where as other companies can take a week to arrive.i will bump it down to a 3 star because they did have to send back a ddr4 ram stick I bought because it was broken which is kind of annoying.",1
Could do better. Not always the most practical option for the purchase of decents. When multi buying a compromise on post and shipment should be considered.,1
"I’m crying right now, bad experience Jesus Christ, it’s over a month and I cannot return an expensive item I bought £1200 because I only have UPS option which is not working for me Ups will not call on arrival and I don’t know whether they have come or not, I just have to stay home 9-5 on my off day hoping to hear someone knockwhat is this😭Customer service chats to you and you can tell they don’t care, I don’t even know how to express my frustration.. I’m soo upset",0
"Always on time with every order, unbeatable!",2
Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.,1
"Took £80, probably for prime, from a family member who definitely doesn't have an amazon account. Couldn't get it refunded, couldn't trace it so £80 down.

"When you need an item and then there is an issue with delivery to a locker. Then offer an alternative!???!! Like it is so unreliable.

"Amazon is ok, but their couriers are not.  I have had an A4 book folded in half to fit in a letterbox as they could not be bothered to knock on the door.

The third time I called, they said there was nothing else they could do because it was in a different department that didn't have a phone number! Only email and snail mail. So it's been 2.5 weeks, three of the same promises and apologies, no resolution and no phonecall as promised within 24 hours of each call. Shame on you Amazon for your poor customer service and while we know $700 is nothing to Bezos, to us middle class people, it's a lot.",0
"unfortunally,amazon canada use intelcom to deliver their parcel. this courrier leave the parcel in the lobby of the building. this happen all the time,despite a very clear notice from the landlord to not leave the parcel in the lobby. the driver do not take the elevator to put the parcel at the door of the suite. they even not ring to see if they are someone at home.  they have been many parcel stolen.  amazon know that issue and do nothing about it. one alternative work well. you request amazon to deliver at your local post office. whitout this i will not buy at amazon to avoid the delivery by this unfamous intelcom.",0
Can you justify why they’re several of your current employees that think it’s ok to attack customers outside their own homes or people being attacked on the street by your employees merely for asking if they need help. Also how can you justify that you used to adervtise the sale of sex dolls based on the appearance of children,0

"Used to LOVE Amazon but no longer a fan someone had gotten ahold of my Amazon prime information and keeps downloading movies n apps my CC has been hit for HUNDREDS of dollars in the last month there are about 4 charges I'm still waiting to be refunded and thank acceptableness the one I got hit for yesterday in the amount of $64 will be refunded. When asked what should I do to keep this from happening was first told to change my password did that went hm n was able to get right onto my prime without having to log in with new password next was told to remove CC did that but then started getting emails telling me to put one back on file or my acct will be closed...put a bogus one on then went in a WK later to place a order had to put my original cc back on to place my order less then a hour late more bogus charges on my acct. The CSRs don't speak proper English so IDT they understand what I'm asking when I say:"" what can I do to keep this from happening"" its getting really frustrating so I guess I'll jus be calling each time to get refunded when I have to put my original cc on file to place an order n get hit with charges I did not authorize. Can't wait until another company comes out similar...I will be RUNNING to them..",1
"Top notch support and outstanding customer support, they treated me VERY well even though i'm quite uninteractiond within this field. All in all, 5 out of 5!",1
"I had some pretty ordinary online orders before, and of course at last I jumped to Amazon, well the order came pretty quick, in around 5-6 days ( I am talking about international shipping) but the shipping fee is ridiculous! I bought two books and the shipping fee is more expensive than the books! -_-",1
"The bathing suit is super cute and well made and I would give it 5 stars but, it arrived completely wet. Like, the plastic bag it was in was completely dry...didn’t notice it was damp until i took it out of the packaging. So therefore I put it through the wash before I even tried it on (I’m not sure if this affected the sizing but I ordered a small and after the wash it was fine - didn’t return because it really seemed ok) it didn’t smell or anything and it hadn’t rained at all when it was delivered...just weird. But the suit is very cute over all. Probably won’t order another one though...",1

"Terrible service, driver marked status as delivered without delivering it. Spent half n hour looking for it. I wont talk about their customer services. The other week they sent half of my food order. Was nice buying from you un the past but i wont be giving amazon any of my hard earned or time",0
Seems Amazon all over the world is becoming a company loads are turning away from - its not coincidence that Jeff is leaving - his Managing directors have let him down and allowed their customer service to be from a 3rd world and who dont know how to give any customer support - the warehouse in the UK stole some of my goods I was selling so eventually they gave me £155 for them - yet now they wont give me my money incase a customer asks for a refund - i have not even been verified to sell anything yet - so these must have to be imaginary customers - their staff just copy and paste a response that relates to nothing at all about the corrupt behavior. Do amazon not know you can get a program to sent responses that mean nothing at all - wish do it - then they could get rid of all their CS staff. would get a better response from a robot at least they would have the knowledge to understand.I have written to Jeff and the MD in the UK who never respond so have a court date now  - be good to see Amazon with a county court judegment against their name - maybe then they go to india or wherever and start getting rid of staff being paid for nothing,0

"I was waiting for 3 small craft items to arrive to do a project none of which have arrived....Amazon's reasoning "" A POSTAL STRIKE"" I did make enquiries just in case there is NO postal strikes and haven't been since July....now trying to get a refund from Amazon usually do not have many issues but lately its been one thing after another , items left on doorstep and getting nicked, items not turning up, wrong item sent and items broken due to the carelessness of the couriers.

"Most websites have this option of saving a wishlist, my favorite sites have the option of saving items on the websites personal wish list or on amazon's wish list.  I can't always remember all of the website where I have items saved, or which item is in which website; I can, however, always go on amazon and check all of the items I have saved (no matter what website they are from), and there is always the option of grouping different items together.Love It!!",2

They are acceptable about some things but there are some thing on the site that when you buy the will not get back to you. They will take you money and not return it or get back to you on where it’s at.,1
"I have been an Amazon customer since the mid 90's. I don't expect any company to be 100%. Amazon is so big now they just aren't trying. Kindle software stinks the past year, customer support is unavailable, and no one in charge cares further than the stock price. I was a huge fan. Now I am looking for the competition.",1

"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping support. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few average and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman support suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1

Would like to retract my 5 star rating for this awful and pathetic company you call a business sending me emails telling me it my fault my parcel’s haven’t come and looking at investigating ME when it’s you and your company not listening to the customer instructions like I tell everyone don’t just leave anything in my door step give it to a neighbour or wait for me answer the door and you go against my word and just leave it any were and it’s get stolen and half time not even were you leave it and don’t see it again!!!! I’ve spend thousands with your company and get treat no respect and accusations like you are saying even though I spend so much each month PATHETIC and you know put icing on the cake for me most products go missing for my autistic son who doesn’t under stand when they don’t turn up and I go to have behaviour when I gotta go and spend MORE money for your incompetence oh andadd they’ve restricted me buying items as twice I’ve had refund due not getting my parcel and it’s been put on gift card which OFM are not replying for someone who’s been AMAZON for many years this incalled for,0
"I've shopped at amazon.com for more than a decade now, and seen this web site rise up from a simple place to purchase books to one of the most reliable places to order just about anything. Amazon's customer service is so fabulous that if I can find the same thing available through amazon or somewhere else, I've often made the choice to purchase on amazon, thanks to its exceptionally reasonable return policies, and the fact that just about anything amazon ships is perfectly packaged and speedily shipped. Amazon now sells some items which are shipped through ""third parties,"" and the same level of consistency in quality packaging, speedy shipping and items being as advertised may not always apply to such third parties. I especially love amazon's product reviews, and it's links to show what other customers often eventually purchase after viewing a particular item, and I love the way amazon makes it easy to quickly find and read both glowing and critical reviews, to ferret out the real scoop on a particular item. Reviews are voted upon, so more detailed and fair-minded reviews are easy to find, and shoppers can fast become well-educated on just about anything and everything. Amazon is also great for internet window shopping!",2
"I am disappointed with the delivery. Not only is Amazon price gouging, but they are pushing back delivery of essential products needed for families. I ordered mask and gloves and they continue to push the delivery dates back for prime members. This is a disgrace and I am out of my mask and gloves so we are just stuck I guess.",0
"I tried to order a few Sony digital cameras from Amazon.  Once in my Cart, the system recommended cases for the cameras.  Good idea.  I ordered those, too.  However, the camera order was not fulfilled by the supplier.  Not Amazon's fault, however, Amazon still shipped the camera cases.  I wish they had asked if I still wanted those cases once the camera order was cancelled.  A company like Amazon could have easily found another supplier for the cameras.  They didn't, and told me to just re-order myself.  I originally ordered on Black Friday.  Prices have since gone up.  Amazon said it will not honor original pricing.  I'm now not rewarding Amazon with the re-order of the cameras.  However, I will be returning the camera cases that I now don't need.  Last, I put a negative review on Amazon.  However, they emailed to say they wouldn't put it up because reviews can't contain comments on Amazon customer service, only on products.  How nice.  They know the problem, could make it right, but won't, and now won't post the review because they don't want anyone else to know. Been with Amazon 17 years - even after they allowed my 13 yr old to order Amazon Prime without my knowledge.  May be time to find other online shopping options.",0

Ehhh its great and all but they gotta give more opportunities to peepple to make money,2
"Absolutely the worse company ever. Professional scam artists who treat sellers like sh-it and take their money. What kind of policy is this when a customer receives a refund if the item sent out is one day late???? Not only do they refund the customer, the customer keeps the item! Amazon should be shutdown and take court for stealing. A-Z claims is joke. They question you about your performance when you are 0.1% over their 1% threshold. Why am I not performing? It because you keep granting cases for buyers for no fk-ing reason and suspending my account because you want a utility bill and then take 3 months to reply back and grant access to my own money and account. Go fk yourself Amazon!",0
This site is very excellent and learning to make money for weeks.,2
"Seriously thinking about canceling my Amazon Prime Membership.I will never buy anything of value on Amazon again after Amazon’s latest screw up.I had saved up for close a year for a new IPad.My present one is cracked and hardly works.I ordered the new iPad through my Prime Membership. At 1st, Amazon claimed that it would arrive the very next day.That changed to two days, which I was fine with. I paid a friend to hang out and get the iPad from the Amazon driver. I did this because this was an expensive item and I didn’t want anything to happen to it. The tracking information said the iPad would arrive between 11:45am and 2:45 pm. Only 6 stops away. Later, I saw that the iPad had been delivered!Great, I thought!I got home around 5:30pm and asked my friend where’s the iPad?He told me that No Amazon Track or Driver dropped off anything at the front door?What, I exclaimed!I immediately tried to contact Amazon Customer Service, which is a total nightmare and not much help, other than asking if I had checked my front porch?No, it’s not on the front porch!Customerservice told me that the iPad was delivered because it says so?OMG, what’s wrong with these people.Usually Amazon takes a photo of where the driver left the item.In my case, there was No Photo!So, an hour later I was speaking with an Amazon supervisor.I explained everything for the 20th time.Only to be told, please wait another day?I asked if I could get another tracking number for a time of arrival? No Can Do!If the iPad hasn’t arrived by the end of the 3rd day, please call back and file a claim.Well that day came and went, No IPad.I’m presently taking Amazon to Small Claims Court to get my money back.So, the moral of the story is,Think Twice Before You Order Anything Of Value From Amazon!Because if anything goes wrong, You Are On Your Own!Amazon=Buyer Beware!",0
Always good experiences. Whenever bad their customer services sorts it out :) just wish prime was cheaper,2
I've ordered books from here several times and overall it's ok. But the shipping if very expensive and long,1
All companies could learn from Amazon. Very good service and amazing at making things right. ,2

"I have a delivery that they failed to deliver to my home.  This is the Amazon delivery service.  I contacted Amazon.  After a lengthy conversation they said they would deliver it that night.  Right after I got off of chat the first time I got a email asking how I would like the package delivered after spending 15 min in chat telling customer service this exact information.  I then went back to speak to a supervisor and got these responses.

Without knowing the issue I cannot transfer this chat.Me: This is real simple Transfer me to a supervisor as clearly today the first level support is unable to follow simple directions and follow though.Priya: I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.Me: Get me to a supervisor.Get me to a supervisor now or I will post the above chat onling.online*Yogesh Siddheshwar: Hello, my name is Yogesh., I'm here to help you today.Me: Get me to a supervisor.You there?This is very simple you need to answer me and let me know you are getting a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: According to our policy, you will have to tell us your issue first.Me: the first level support is unable to follow simple directions and follow though.That is the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Without knowing the issue we cannot transfer you to our supervisor.Me: Now that you know please transfer me.this is not a hard or complicated request. I already spent 15 min talking to someone just before the above chat that then screwed up.So it is simple give me to your supervisor now.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Yes you can.I have told you the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Is there anything else that I can help you with?Me: Yes you can transfer me to a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Except that?Me: I am not asking for something that is crazy or out of the ordinary.Give me a supervisor.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Give me to your supervisor. You can do this unless there is no supervisor there and I do not believe that to be the case for one moment.Yogesh Siddheshwar: I'm so sorry, but we can't accept your request.Me: Give me to your supervisor. You can do this unless there is no supervisor there and I do not believe that to be the case for one moment.Yogesh Siddheshwar: Unless there is a different issue I can help you with, I will be ending this chat.Me: You need to help with the request as it is not unreasonable and I told you the issue.Yogesh Siddheshwar from Amazon.com has left the conversation.""After the third chat I final got a supervisor.   She said that the package would be at my home last night.   When it was not I contacted Amazon this morning and after waiting almost 20 min online to speak to a supervisor they transferred me to another rep and not a supervisor.  He then told me that I may have to wait until tomorrow to get my packages that were supposed to be delivered yesterday.  The sad thing is that this is not the first time that I have had this issue with amazon but the fourth. I never have this issue when they use fedex or UPS or USPS just the Amazon delivery service.Update: They just ended another chat on me Me: Are you refusing to transfer me to your supervisor?This is a simple yes or no question. Are you refusing to transfer me to your supervisor.Omkar: I'm sorry, but if there was a way I'd have loved, but there is no way to extend by 6 months.However, I'll do my best to get this order to you. :)Me: Again not the answer to my question.Omkar: I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.Omkar from Amazon.com has left the conversation.",0
"I am still awaiting a refund from an item I returned in December 2019! I ordered a Xmas gift from Amazon at the end of November, they sent the wrong item, I returned it and asked for the order I had originally purchased to be sent!  The order was WRONG again!  I spoke to Amazon twice about this and and asked for a refund.  I returned the order and did not receive any email at first to say they had received it.  On 2nd January I rang them, they said they had received it and I would have a refund.  On 8th January I received an email saying they had received it.  I rang again and Amazon said it would take 5-7 days to receive a refund.  A week later I rang AGAIN!  They said they would refund but it would AGAIN take 5-7 days from the call to receive a refund!  I have rung TODAY and been assured I will now receive my refund!  The lady today - Joanna - was good on the phone unlike one of her previous colleagues who was very curt on the phone, however she said she would email me to confirm the refund was going through and I am yet to receive that email - here's hoping!  In 2018 I had problems with Xmas orders not arriving at all and late refund payments.  I was hoping that a YEAR on, the service would have got better.  It HASN'T!",0

Three days  latter the money was back in my account. How many company's do you know that give level of customer service!",2
I have been using Amazon for a while and really like their customer assistance. I wish they audit sellers on the platform properly because many ship from china and return policy is not clear on those. ,1
"I was ordering sunglasses from Amazon but unfortunately it didn’t fit my face. I decided to return the item back with all original package and label to Canada Post. I was wait thing to get my money back in 14 days after they receive an item. 14 days past and I still didn’t get money back. No item no money 😂 funny joke. I start to chat with customers service and they told me wait another 30 days for return. Is it kind a joke nowadays? Why should I have to wait 44 days to get my money back if in your policy it’s 14 days after receiving the item. It was horrible experience for the first time in my life! I was so mad and disappointed with customer service and support. I have no many and I don’t know if I will have them back. I will wait 30 more days and write additional reviews how they gonna solve this problem. It’s ridiculous way how you treat customers this way!!! Shame on you Amazon. From personal experience I recommend everyone go to the store and buy directly!!! Instead of arguing with customers service that DON’T Care at All about you or your situation. All they care to get money from you , but not responsibility.",0
Been a prime user for about 3 years. Use to be really fine. Even use to get same day shipment. Now shipment’s are 2-4 days,1
I like this marketplace for its easy navigation. Fast delivery and a large selection. I always choose gifts for my family and friends here.,2
"order not dispatched, very average shipment time",1
"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!",1
Sometimes orders came wrong not as descriptionbut overall nice prices according to the quality.,1
"Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime. It just seems more like a waste of money to me.But I've never had an issue with Amazon itself.",1
Always deliver when they're meant to and never any issues!,2
"Ordered an item with expedited international delivery on 10 October. On the store page Amazon said delivery by 30 Oct.It finally was shipped on 27 October, with new delivery date being end of November.

Always easy and always as promised. I love the convenience!,2
"At Amazon the customer service representatives are not trained well and Amazon does not care. For instance, I bought a $ 5373.98 zero turn motor from a third party seller on Amazon. I had to summit an A to Z claim because I received a damaged unusable mower due to a crushed mower deck underneath unit. I won the claim at first but an Amazon employee  told me that I won it and since my banking services (Amazon visa credit card) due date was in a day or two,  he told me to dispute it with credit card, because it was  refunded and I wouldn’t be penalized for the dispute.  So A to Z took refund back, if you dispute the amount on your credit card A to Z won’t honor their refund.   Amazon didn’t care even if I had submitted a  Notarized witness statement of a friend visiting and who heard speaker phone calls.  Also had an witness to mover problems. Then Amazon told me to cancel dispute again. That this change would get my refund back.  Again she witnessed the speaker phone conversation. I just got lucky she was here.  Amazon took no responsibility for their workers statements concerning making or canceling the  credit card dispute in the first place and then they just dropped it.  They would not pay the return shipping and the seller will not.  This seller had bad BBB score and complaints. So I have re disputed with credit card with no other recourse. So Amazon is not your friend. So started shopping others sites with free shipping and returns. Wow I beat Amazon prices to heck and back. From 50 to 15 percent on every item plus no tax, too.  I took a friends new monthly statement of $4376.00 and shopped  those items. (They paid their bill off every month like I do.) The same exacted items, He would of saved big nearly $1000.00by buying with other non Amazon sellers was amazing (with free shipping and returns! WOW This was a shock. I think he is returning most of them. I told him to be careful with too many returns, (he likes prime streaming services,) they would bar him from Amazon, if they received to many returns.  I have decided I want to help people wake up and see the real Amazon. I want them to use Amazon not let Amazon use them.  I have Several meetings arranged with different groups this month. I will address and make aware of the Ins and outs with Amazon. I call it “Amazon Ain’t Your Friend”. I compare Amazon to Sears in the late1800- 1930. And Amazon will fall too.  I just do not ever want Amazon to rip off another person. They obviously don’t check out their sellers. At the end of this month, I am canceling prime ASAP. I am not stupid, I want to finish using bonus points. Got 40 dollars to go. You can keep your Amazon-visa credit card and used your points against your statement balance. Amazon has become an American Bad Habit and addiction. It would be a Tragedy for Americans to be left with only Amazon, once every other retailer goes bust because of them! Then u will be at the mercy of Amazon the Almighty!   I got a car and truck sign ordered “Amazon ain’t your friend”. So a new adventure awaits me. Good Luck. If you would like for me to give a presentation for your group, just email me, no can’t leave an email  but here’s my phone number 870-723-3625, send me a text, Attention Amazon issues. The presentation is free in the continental USA at this time. Also if I can help let me know.  I will check it out, but my opinion is Amazon doesn’t want their real policies known. I didn’t know you would lose an A to Z refund if amount was disputed on Amazon credit card. Who would of known. I couldn’t find anything information concerning A toZ refunds. This has never happened on eBay or pay pal. I had an 7800.00 dispute due the purchase of a truck. The engine blew up after delivery. I got my money back. Guys,  we the customers created a monster retailer, they have sold our information and got rich doing it. So that’s why I am doing this. I Hope I can help.  I bought a vlogging equipment from another business and returned the one from Amazon. Saved 50 bucks! Maybe You Tube is next step for me. I am retired.  So again Amazon Ain’t Your Friend, Pal!",0
"If I could give amazon zero stars I would. This company was once good. Its now terrible.  Ordered a motorcycle jacket nowhere near the correct size. Sent the jacket straight back 2 weeks later still no refund , customer services are as much good as a chocolate fire guard. Amazon first blamed the seller,  the seller blamed amazon, amazon are now saying its my bank (its not I've checked,) absolute joke I reckon that's me done with Amazon",0
"Take my money for registration and more than month my application ander revive. Its no contacts with the, They not respect sellers at all. Very disappointed, Cant even start working.",0
"Fantastic at giving refunds when necessary  .As an elder person I  sometimes struggle with comprehending all the services on offer as I  don't always get it,  sometimes I dont understand what I'm actually buying , but that's me.But they're really great for refunds and if something is faulty, or you make a mistake in your purchase they are really,  really up on it.Love it",2
"We have recently ordered a bed, which was destroyed in delivery and a matress, which has still not arrived eight days after the delivery date. This was despite paying for premium delivery.  Customer service were good at dealing with the bed that was destroyed in delivery but awful with the matress. We felt at times that we were being laughed at. We are NEVER buying from Amazon EVER again. Very disappointed!",0
"Amazon’s shipment assistance is decent and legit quicker than other ecommerce in Australia, But the subscription plans are pretty suspicious. I got phone calls from amazon in my personal number which I registered in amazon, and someone said that your prime subscription is turned on (But it’s not) and you are about to be charged 80 dollars for that. I said I am rich, don’t worry about the payment. Then I removed my bank card from the app.",1
The best online site to sell your products! Have used them for a long time and I'm quite happy with them. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. I can recommend Amazon.com,2

"Okay so my problem with amazon originally started as my fault, i put the wrong address. Instead of putting west I put east. On the day of the delivery the driver called me, I apologized and gave him the correct address, and he told me he would update the address and I would get it delivered the following day. Cool.So the following day I check my shipping address at 6 am, and it wasn't corrected. I did the chat thing and the chatter informed me that she added it to the delivery instructions. Skeptical, I called in and the lady on the phone confirmed with me I would receive the package today at the corrected address.A few hours go by and I receive a call from the driver that he was at the wrong address, yet again, and when I gave him the corrected address he said it was outside of his delivery zone.So I call in again and after a 30 minute phone call of just trying to update my address for the following day, the guy told me he updated the notes and address. Address was still incorrect and delivery notes were deleted and he put that I wanted my order the following day.So I then do the chat thing again and they inform me to replace the order and I would get a full refund, which would've worked but I had ordered the last item in stock. So I ask if I can update the address and they tell me no and ask if I want to speak to a specialist.I understand the mistake was originally my fault but it is a simple mistake and I was willing to wait a few days to accommodate that but they have no basic understanding of what I am asking for.",0
"The present I ordered for my wife was supposed to be delivered today but I was not able to receive it as I was not sent the security code which was required. It may have gone to an old email address and I have been on the chat line trying to register my current email address. However, I am getting no response to my request and I need the shipment by tomorrow art the latest. How do I make real contact with anyone at Amazon to get a simple answer",1
"Hands down the best website online. They took over, i used to use ebay but now it's all amazon!",2

"Absolute poo, poo costumer service, poo products, poo delivery. They lie constantly. When they dont feel like sending you a refund directly in account they tell you they tried and bank rejected. THE BANK WILL NEVER REJECT A REFUND, not only that but they dont even have the capability of rejecting any refunds. They ignore me on why they lie and tell me to wait for a call so they can give me a gift card…basically to make sure they keep the money.",0
"It is really easy to sale and purchase from Amazon and their Kindle is really sturdy and affordable for those who just love web browsing and online movie watching.  They even provide many different language options to your Kindle.  I just wish that they would reach out to obtain more apps that the google playstore has.  Like ""Line,"" ""Uber"" and etc.  I do draw internet from my cellphone plans when I'm out.  Also they could enhance their appstore by allowing titles of the apps to be in different languages.  When I'm researching for bilingual games for my son.  It is amazing what I have to guess through the English titles to find them.  And thank you for adding that button to close all apps.  My son was burning down those Kindles way too fast when he runs through the apps w/o closing them and causing them to frequently crash.  Our family are on our 6th Kindle and so far it's great.  Tech support are courteous w/ a bit of accent, but gets what I need done.  Thanks.",2
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
"Amazon recently setup their own delivery service. Problem is they don't actually deliver the products you order, or have any ability to track said orders or give you any guidance when you call them. If this is the direction amazon is taking then i'd be very worried about their future since they can't get their affairs in order for simple things.",0
fast delivery to any state.  love this store,2

"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative interaction with Amazon customer support over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a shipment date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer support to get a more specific shipment date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in shipment. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended interaction with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
"When ever I need something, a book, a hairbrush, a video....groceries what have you...they have it and generally at a better price! I even got my bed from them. Customer service is always professional and quick!",2
"Find alot of items overpriced, claim to give you free shipment if you are an amazon prime member but actually it comes in the price of items. Will block you from reviewing their items without an explanation. Given 3 stars as they do deliver next day or when promised. some items can be awkward to return if not up to satisfaction.",1

I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1
"Love Amazon buy from all the time excellent company to do business with, they have everything you’d want. Recommended to everyone! 💖",2
"Exceptional customer service. Thanks, Amazon!",2
"I really love the item range at Amazon.com However, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD) If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me. Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of support from Amazon.",1

"I sent an item that was under warranty back to Amazon for a refund six weeks ago...After six weeks I had to contact them looking for my refund.. I spoke with a rep that assured me that my money was on its way back to me immediately and all was good..... Not so... Further week later still no refund and now still waiting... A disaster   ... I wouldn't recommend Amazon because their refund policies are crap, and they lie about making such refunds in a timely manner..",0
"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has fine infrastructure (fast order, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1
"The prime fee is not worth it any longer Also, when a package is late they refer you to ups who in turn advise you to contact AmazonThey dont have ownership anymore but expect you to pay for their prime support",1

"Prices are still acceptable but assistance going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer assistance and not just 'cheapest'.",1
I pay for prime. However I am sick of these Chinese sellers seaping through they say they are UK based but that isn't true! Have to wait ages for items to arrive from China which isnt stated on the onset. This is dishonest to some degree. After orders the time frame often changes to longer. This is not the reliable Amazon I started out with.,1
Service is fine. easy to order.,1
Would give 0 stars. Since Amazon is trying to cancel free speech I cancelled my account. I will never do business again with Amazon.,0
Absolutely rubbish still waiting on Xmas presents and other orders not turning up,0
"It's okay, but since finding TEMU, I'm a converted customer. Things are much more affordable on there, same items at such a lower price. They have 50% off if you put this in the search bar afb28153 once you download the app!",1
I order few household item in the last week from Amazon in Vancouver Canada and all have been delivered timely. Very very happy.,2
"Money taken out of my bank for item but after 5 days got cancelled, I got charged they said 5 days refund ,nothing.  I made complaint and ti be told we didnt charge you in the 1st place, It states on my on line banking been charged. Had to contact my bank its ridiculous never had problem before.",0
My son got a kindle fire kids tablet for Christmas from his aunt. I didnt have an amazon account before he got his tablet I had to set one up. His tablet broke after only 3 weeks and I figured with the 2 year warranty that came with the pad I could replace it. Well I contact amazon and they supposedly need a debit or credit card before they can process the warranty I dont have a debit or credit card and so they told me they couldn't replace the tablet. I will never order from Amazon this is a joke I cant get my kids Christmas present replaced just because I do t have a credit or debit card.,0
I have had an Amazon account for years. Now all of a sudden when I try to place an order they send me a notice that there is suspicious activity on my account and shut everything down. I have been double charged for an order I have not received and other orders cancelled. My order history has been deleted. I have spent hours over several days trying to get my account straightened out. Now I am going to delete my account and take my business elsewhere.,0
They delivered a broken item and refunded to full amount! Great customer service!,2
"Amazon generally is good and I have been a customer for a number of years. My only gripes have been down to the size of packaging used compared to the size of the item (and the environmental impact this has) and the laziness of their drivers/couriers who often do not ring the bell when I am at home, don’t always put the package through letterbox when it would fit and instead just leave on the doorstep.",2
"Ive had some issues with Amazon products in the past, but I can say that there work environment has been a great place for my family. They have expressed how good of a job Amazon is for them.",2
Ordered a bunch of T-shirts but the actual cloth material was thin and see through. Wasn't worth the amount charged. Delivery was on-time so thankful for that.,1
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after Prime prices were raised and item prices are higher than in stores already. Amazon is now charging for returns also.  Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1
I like amazon but when I wanted to voice my opinion about a seller they would not post my review,1
"Amazon customer assistance phone number for united state  is +1 (855) 369 8565 for united stateAmazon.com, Inc., is an American multinational technology company based in Seattle that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It is considered one of the Big Four tech companies, along with Goog",1
"I always find myself going back to amazon becouse there prices are so acceptable, however i have had several average usages while buying from resellers that are allowed to advertise on there site, with one order taking two weeks to arrive, the real sting in the tail was that the HD-dvd went bust a couple of weeks later",1
My packages have been late at least 6 times this month and another 4 the month before. I think it’s excessive to be late. It’s guaranteed to get there on that date as instructed by them. They make up they needed to check another fulfillment center which is ridiculous then don’t put that it’s available. I have several fulfillment centers and they don’t deliver on time.,0
"Ordered from amazon and received by prime, no issues and fast delivery!",2
Excellent thanks for letting,1
"Do not, I repeat do not order here.This company is one of the if not the worst.I've been a customer for 10 years. Never had any issue.Until I had an issue. Just before Christmas. Amazon's solution to ANY problem? We ""will,"" (they wont) call you back tomorrow. This can go on for weeks depending if you get someone on the phone who cares about their 10 cent a hour job ( outsourced callcenter)  Then if you finally get your order , IT WONT EVEN BE YOUR ORDER, And guess what return process takes atleast 2 weeks.And I am not even speaking of the endless documentation requested to prove account ownership when you buy something expensive. As of this day amazon is still holding over a 1000 euro hostage in refund and will call me any day now ( yeah no) Tldr (to long didn't read)You are safer replying to Nigerian scam mails than by shopping with Amazon.",0
Don’t gave amazon your credit card number or any information.Becouse they take out $371.00 from my account and I didn’t order anything with that amount.When I called them it was not in their records but why did it say amazon.So my bank is looking into now.So beware if you use them and keep track of your bank account or you will be next.I will never  order anything from them again.,0
"Unfortunately I have had several average usages in dealing with this company, which is why I have rated them in the middle.",1
I had an initial problem with Mart24 but because it was through Amazon they contacted the company and Mart24 customer service reached a very good outcome ,2
Well I'm not happy with Amazon and I won't be robbed by them again goodbye Amazon account,0
"Great customer service, quick delivery, cheap prices",2
Fast Shipping & Great Products! Highly recommend!!,2
This has got to be my favourite site! Customer service is excellent and any queries  have been dealt with promptly and prices are pretty much unbeatable.,2
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
"The company has ordinary ethics, but they’re still one of the best places to shop. Use them if you must but search for alternatives elsewhere first.",1
"Miss delivered, but customer assistance was great and resolved the issue. Thanks.",1
too many third party information scammers and customer service has been absolutely useless in any issues I've ever encountered over the last 10 years.,0
Okay I have to give 3 stars but will explain. Amazon them self is truly 5 star I have had issues with not receiving items especially from 3rd party’s (scammers) and they refund ASAP and for that I would give them 5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ I have to drop 2 stars because of their order assistance is always mysteriously losing  my packages that usually are electronics although they refund me I have to  wait a few days till they see if it is gonna be delivered before they even speak to you about it. Normally it be okay but these last to was for my flight that the refunding and reordering it will not be here in time. I know they contract order company but they need to get this under control. I’m not the only one with this issue.,1
"Never had an issue with this company, always deliver on time - usually early. I'd use them more if they didn't go out of their way to avoid taxes. But really there's no-one to touch them for value & service.",2
Amazon makes shopping so convenient and affordable. They have a huge selection and their prices are almost always the lowest anywhere. Free two-day shipping is an incredible deal and I highly recommend you join Amazon Prime.,2
Great price and super fast shipping.,2
"This review is being put here as seems impossible to get in touch with Amazon about a driver.When you see a NO turning sign on a private drive and bollards in place you dont expect Amazon driver to reverse into driveway, get out and MOVE the bollard so can turn around and then not replace it.All other drivers who deliver here reverse up the road..  obviously by looking at state of the vans i guess a lot of the drivers cant reverse a van that big",0
"I would not suggest even for this one star, I don’t have an zero option and hence this star. Worst ever. They don’t deliver half of the products and say that we are responsible for the product even if it is not delivered. I have decided to stop shopping with amazon",0
Went to check the tracking of a parcel and found I had to pay £1.50 to download app to check where my parcel is. This is ridiculous!!!,1
Poor . bad . Not a very good website for buying world wide The taxes are very high and the shipping price gets more than 150 dollars i wont buy or sell from that website again,0
"Pay for prime same day order nothing come ring up promise next day order customer assistance was great at this time. Then rang a 4pm to ask is it out for order oh yes you will definitely get it tonight after a hour on the phone still no further only wait 48 hours (there fav line),",1
With current situations still managing to get my deliveries at decent time rate.,2
I have been told that amazon refund team will contact or send me an email for past 10 days now and all in vain i've been put on hold more minutes that the CSR have tried to have a conversation. Its one of the worst customer service I have come across. Amazon the so called multi billion dollar company cannot sort their CUSTOMER SERVICE. May be the owner became billionaire from not refunding the customer.,0
"NEVER do business with these tyrants. Amazon is an enemy to the US and cannot excel because of that. REMEMBER traitors, famous last words are always ""No..wait...I was on your side!"" The power hungry will turn and devour you as well!",0
"I placed an order on 06,01. I got an email on 13/01 telling me about the delay for my order. which stated : *If the order won't arrive by the time you need it, you can cancel the order or an individual item from your order by visiting Your Account, and viewing the order details. As long as the item hasn't entered the dispatch process,you'll be able to cancel it.*However, this was not true and it actually was impossible to cancel the order, either on my account or by contacting the supplier ( as per automated message on my account) who said that only Amazon could cancel it and also said that my payment was still pending , which is also untrue.I am now told by their advisors that it is not possible for them to cancel the order until it has been dispatched!!!!! I think I am just being fobbed off with random  excuses/explanations. This is ridiculous, makes no sense whatsoever and istotally unacceptable.This email also says: *We're sorry about the delay in getting your order to you, but I'm pleased to tell you that we're preparing it for dispatch now.**Within the next business day you should receive an e-mail from us confirming that the following items have been dispatched:*This ,too, is untrue as apparently they are still trying to locate the item and it has not been dispatched yet. But I do not want it  sent to me, I want it cancelled, as I have been saying since 13/01, and  my money refunded but according to their advisors this cannot be done until it has been dispatched.And apparently there is no way of getting this complaint escalated to a non existent complaint department as I a told the customer service is  also the complaint department . Resolver is not an option either as Amazon UK has decided not to accept complaints raised via Resolver.Absolutely disgusting customer serviceNEVER AGAIN",0
If you use the platform properly you can avoid 9 out of the 10 problems people are talking about. Watch your sellers and READ about shipping,2
dealing with used goodss can be a nightmare sometimes. The used listings often don't contain enough info and goods overview to give you an idea about the condition.,1
"If they had a zero star rating would be better.Amazon doesn’t help their customers in any way,will never use amazon again",0
I turn to Amazon for all my gift giving and hard to find shopping!  They are loyal and easy for refunds.  ,2
"Been an amazon fan for years, estimate I do around 50% of my shopping from here. In recent times I find amazon lacking; crazy delivery fees, items jumping up in price, and my account has been hacked a few times. Disappointing",0
They usually deliver fairly quickly. Can't complain.,2
