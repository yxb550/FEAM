Placed 2 orders with Amazon last night just after 9pm and both orders arrived (free delivery) by 3.30pm today! That’s both orders processed and delivered in less than 19 hours.  An impressed and happy regular customer,2
"I have ordered a lot of stuff in my time being with Amazon, a lot more than I should publicly admit. Whenever I have ordered anything from them it has always been delivered on time to what they estimate and in good condition. Even when there have been times that the product was just not right or faulty for whatever reason, their refund system has always been easy and straight forward to use. Although I'd have to say that their Pass the Parcel scheme is good in practice it's just not best when you go to one of these designated places and they look down upon you for daring to do a refund in their shop. But clearly not an Amazon issue. My only issue and it would be more search related is that some items are cryptically hidden on the website so you will need to be really specific or it may just not be on there. If I'm searching for a Man United baby-grow I will most certainly be offended if you suggest a Liverpool one!",2
I have been using Amazon for a while and really like their customer support. I wish they audit sellers on the platform properly because many ship from china and return policy is not clear on those. ,1
"I pay my taxes, but they don't!! What a F$#!%&g joke!1 day order is quite nice though",1

"From books, video games, to everyday goods such as paper towels, laundry detergent, and dog food (Subscribe & Save + Prime = awesome!), Amazon is where I do all my shopping.  Amazon Prime, despite the pricey annual membership, is incredibly convenient and quickly pays for itself just for the free 2 day shipping along.  I can't imagine shopping this conveniently anywhere else.",2
Service is worse these days and prices too,1
They are rats They charged me 179 dollars for nothing they don’t explain why just make excuses they are rats,0
"Yes, the prices on Amazon are great and the selection is awesome, but their constant pushiness to sign up to prime is annoying. I know that it's how you guys make your money, but start off by adding free shipping globally, and then, maybe, it will be justified...",1
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a support that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this support. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
Amazon is falling off my packages are not being delivered more an more. I don't know what's going on at that Staten Island location but they are truly messing up the customer service.,0
"If I could give them a zero I would. I had an old debit card get hot carded 1 year ago. I updated my primary payment method for Amazon with my new card I got from my bank. The new card worked for a month or two and then I noticed a part that I had ordered did not arrive when I expected. I went into Amazon and checked and it said order cancelled. Did I get an email, text notification or phone call.....NO! So after some digging and contacting their customer service they stated it was using my old card, I told them to remove it and ensure that my new card was set as default card. So another couple months go by and now another package is not shipping when I expect and so I login and check Amazon again and it states payment needs revision....It was trying to use my old card yet again! I called this time as I was upset and needed the order before I left out of town. I call to see if they can fix what is going on and also get my order shipped ASAP. The original order (Tuesday Morning) stated with my prime membership that they would have it to me Wednesday evening. However, since they messed up my payment method yet again, now when fixing the order after losing the whole day it states my order will not arrive until Friday evening, when I will be out of town! So their mistake and it cost me delivery time and do they offer to fix it. No!! They instead tell me all the reasons why I could have messed up the payment, which is absolute lie! They tell me after about 45 seconds that they cannot do anything about the shkpping to get it to me sooner. I cancelled membership and then they tell me I would not get a refund because I used up shipping credits, IT IS PRIME! When asking for when I used these credits they could not provide me any information....this was management.. They are going downhill and customer service is horrible.",0
"I was a victim of fraud so l called to cancel the fraudulent account but according to te reps l have to login to cancel. What how do you access an account you didn't create. I asked for supervisors because of all the ""overseas"" didn't understand spoke with someone here still the same run around. ",0
"Amazon used to be good and I had very few errors over the years, and any errors were quickly fixed.Recently they stared to use a delivery company called i-Parcel who are the budget division of UPS. What a disaster! Twice they waiting 3 weeks before telling they can't deliver the items. They just made a series of blatant lies to justify the non-delivery. Such as ""we can't deliver knifes to your location"", but I never ordered a knife, I ordered computer parts!Time to look elsewhere.",0
Bad service if you lucky you don't have to deal with the Philippines,0
Try to place an order and they tell me they will get back with me in 24 hours. Been a week. Is this the best this rich greedy jerk can do?,1
"Amazon’s Pathetic Delivery Service. On average I usually have fine support with Amazon. However, today I am extremely dissatisfied. I was expecting a package all day today only to find out later that Amazon delivered my package to a “resident”. They never approached my residence. I have cameras and cameras don’t lie.  Now, I have to wait an additional two days. Pathetic order support.",1
I love Amazon! They are simply the best,2
"It is good, but not perfect. Now the prime day deals are amazing but sometimes the one-day delivery turns into two days. I haven't experienced more than two days thank god. It would have been perfect if they sold tech kits for cheap too and its a guaranteed one day delivery.",2
I received my order very quickly and accurately. I will absolutely use Amazon again.,2
"SHIPPING ISSUES! This place just sucks. ""Your order has been delivered"". Ummmm, no it hasn't. Well where the freak is it?! Won't even mention how I couldn't understand the rep i was talking to, cuz they didn't even speak english. When talking to post office that they contacted with me on the line, they hang up. Thanks Marcus or Marcos. Needless to say canceled membership and will HOPEFULLY get a refund, but I doubt it.",0
I always check Amazon first before going anywhere else.  Great deals and free shipping on most items!,2
"complete joke, very poor customer support, using bot answers as they have so many complaints",0
"on shipment time. When I order sometime for one day shipment I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
"I ordered a patio umbrella on Aug. 1, 2021 on Amazon which I received. I have my credit card record showing the transaction. I needed to order a broken replacement part, only to discover there is no record of the purchase on Amazon itself in my order history so I contacted the company, Best Choice Products. They also had no record of my purchase. They can do nothing without my order ID number. I contacted Amazon Customer service chat online and repeatedly (3X) got what was obviously not a real person but an AI. I asked ""Are you a real person or an AI?"" and was told ""I am a real person"", but the responses were still like a programmed AI. I said, ""What is your favorite ice cream?"" because an AI would not be set up to respond. Sure enough, no answer. I wrote, ""I am not sure you are a real person so if you answer that question, I'll know."" The response: ""I am a real person"" which is the exact phrase that is always used. It's triggered by the phrase ""real person"". He refused to answer a simple question about ice cream so I knew it was an AI yet again. I finally gave up because it just kept going around in circles because its coding couldn't handle the complexity.  Shame on Amazon for lying to its customers that its customer service help are 'real people'.",0
"As an Amazon Prime user who frequents both the Instant Video function and the main wesbite I can say - to a tee, this is one of the best services i've ever dealt with.Customer Support - 10/10      Customer Support Staff seem to always go out of their way to try and help you with an issue, and the majority of the time will compensate you for your troubles. I was given 1 month free of Prime for my RX480 GFX Card being 2 days later than it was supposed too.I was given 2 months free of Prime and a full refund for a product being over a week late.Instant Video - 10/10     No issues with load times and/or buffering. Streaming Service works well which is better than some others.ConsAmazon sellers and Amazon themselves have to pay people to deliver your product, these people tend to be the only issue in a well oiled machine and are an issue with any online retailer.",2
Amazon double charges customers!!!! They are a bunch of thieves.,0
"Company accepted payment for multiple orders, taking payment and decided afterwards to suspend orders to verify payment details. Customer service worker advised me to open a new account with UK phone number & this ended in the same situation.Refused to cancel orders or provide any evidence/record/reference number of requests to cancel/refund.Company's practice borders on illegal activity, which is not surprising as Amazon benefits form modern day slavery.",0
"Amazon locked my account without explanation. All I ever did was purchase some Kindle books using gift cards and my debit card. I lost access to my Kindle library. When I replied to their email and asked them to explain what exactly I did wrong, they said I ""may have provided inaccurate information to Amazon or otherwise used the account in violation of the Amazon conditions of use policy"". But I never did anything like that. And it's obvious that they aren't even sure I did. I'll never buy any digital content from Amazon again.",0
"After complaining to customer support, I was reassured this would not happen ... Amazon customer care number.....",1

"My items appeared as delivered but never camed. After a conversation with a representative I was told my address is wrong in the system so I provided the correct one. I was advised to call a day later to make a refund request. When i called on the day after , i was told my details are correct and refund cannot be processed unless I provide a police report case that has been already been closed. I spoke with multiple agents from the Philippines and India and it felt as if i was talking to a wall. Hearing the same nonsense. My question is when the courier is Amazon why can't they contact the driver and see what happend . Why am i the one who should contact the police if i have zero fault there. The parcel appeared as deliver on Sunday 4th of the December, when i was in the house the whole day. After checking the doorbell camera there were no movement of any delivery guys.The filipino rep told it was handed to someone. And promise to put me on to a manager. It didn't happen nor i received the callback he promised. The Indian girl said the calls are recorded but i cannot get those. Every Time I called i asked the rep to leave a note of in the interaction records on my account. The same Indian girl told me there were no notes. And while i was having a conversation with her she said thanks and hang up on me. I dont feel that this is how people spending their money on Amazon should be treated.",0
I never ever had an issue with Amazon. My first preference is always amazon only!,2
"I have ordered two goodss in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.  Now I am wondering if I can trust them to get a package delivered for Christmas, even with “guaranteed “ order dates.",1
"Half the packages delivered smell strongly of heavy laundry products chemically infused. Their employees transfer the smell from their clothes onto the products. Asthma, rash. This has happened too many times. Ordering elsewhere.",0
"Hello and goodbye. I was a new Amazon customer since, but I'm leaving now, because I'm an American!",0
"Ordered a $3000 product and it showed that the product shipped. In fact the product did not ship and the price jumped up significantly $1200 to be exact. When I left a negative review about the shady transaction, Amazon pulled my review. This has been the 3rd time with a similar outcome. I purchase and item, the item does not ship, then the price goes up and still shows in stock. Amazon has become a very shady place to shop. They truly have no customer service anymore. Also if you leave a review they don't like it will not get posted. Shady! Shady! Shady! I will be looking elsewhere for my online purchases from now on.",0

If you use the platform properly you can avoid 9 out of the 10 problems people are talking about. Watch your sellers and READ about shipping,2
"I order most things from Amazon and am actually satisfied. However, sometimes the good are not packaged properly or are damaged, which should be rectified.",2
Some order’s never come and some order’s get dumped around back,1
Greatest customer-centric company on the planet.,2
I ordered a book and the item arrived in 48 hours. I am very happy about the service from Amazon UK.,2

"My wife and I have been customers for a number of years. We have always found them to be excellent in everything. Recent notable experience was we bought a coffee machine, Nespresso, and it developed a fault. Amazon and Nesspresso worked on sorting it out with minimum fuss, see also my review for Nesspresso.The only caveat to the above is that sometimes you have to check prices against other suppliers but other than that I would recommend them to everyone.

"Rubbish pathetic wrapping material.I bought a Paper Mache bird with hearts attached and Amazon decided to post it to me in a Cardboard Stiff Envelope?No wrapping around the object to cushion it, nothing.",1
Amazon allows an order to be cancelled before the order has been dispatched.  I ordered a phone case and then noticed it was coming from China and would be a long time arriving. I checked to see it hadn't been dispatched and sent a cancel request. When this was not acknowledged I sent three more. .A day or so later I checked my Amazon account to find it was just dispatched in spite of all my cancellation requests. Amazon now tell me I had only 30 mins to cancel the order even though it hadn't been dispatched for almost two days after my cancellation.,1
"I find Amazon generally supplies acceptable customer support, acceptable prices and deliveries. However, the continual tricks used to trip people up when placing orders, making other methods of shipment (such as choosing prime) so bold and prevalent and presenting things in a confusing manner very frustrating.Prime, is only any acceptable for deliveries coming from Amazon itself. Music, TV and other supports are only given to tempt you to pay more to see the rest of the TV series or the music track you really want to hear. Take music for example. Amazon music is free with advertising, to a degree. Then you have music prime with no add’s. But to get the full Amazon music, you have to pay again. No thanks Amazon.",1

"I would like to say Amazon is terrible. It's business practices and treatment of employees are both questionable at best. It's ridiculous how little tax they pay. But they do their job very well. They make shopping easy. Their customer service is good enough. Refunds are usually straightforward.I'd love to hate Amazon, but I can't fault their execution.",2

"Decent, these days a lot of cheap and/or fake decents are being sold on the site.  Sometimes packages may get lost, but usually replaced.",1
"Amazon used to be great.  Now they have started using USPS - which is snail mail.  I’m waiting on hygiene goodss that keep getting extended.  The package is in my state, there is no excuse - what is going on in Texas is not affecting it.  At this rate I am going to stop buying basic needs on Amazon, and so are a lot of other people.  I’m not the only one frustrated.  Amazon fresh is pretty decent, but very little choices.",1
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime support, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1
"I order alot from Amazon. One thing I do not like is when my order is delivered they do not ring the door bell. I live in a semi average neighborhood and in apartments. I do not know why they can literally walk right up here set my package at my door, take a picture of it but not ring the bell. Every time. I only had 2 people ring the bell out of 30-40 orders. It just tells me the company does not care if you get your order or not. They only want to make a sell and protect themselves.",1
Usually you find what your looking for on Amazon but they can be a little pricey plus shipping and tax adds to the price. If you sign up for thank you and rewards points thru citi.com that helps.,1
"Placed order which was shipped with Amazon Prime with a scheduled delivery date of 2/10/2021. I rearranged my schedule so that I would be home to accept the delivery. On the evening of 2/9/2021 I checked my Amazon account and found that Amazon had changed the delivery date to Friday 2/12/2021 without notifying me. I immediately contacted Amazon Customer Service, but they were not willing to fix or provide compensation since I would now have to rearrange my Friday schedule to be home to accept the delivery. I submitted a BBB complaint, but the Amazon BBB representative refused it. Amazon Customer Service is just about as bad as Comcast.",0
Good Experience making payment etc!!,2
I have being shopping at Amazon from about 2005 and never had a problem with my package.Once I ordered and my item was the wrong size sent and contact them and it was rectified easily.IOn another occassion I bought an item and I did not get it and they re sent another.No hassle.I will continue shopping Amazon.PLEASE READERS DO NOT SHOP CHARLOTTE RUSSE..THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!,2

"from what I see here, you are all a bit frustrated, first of all, some of you wouldn't last even 2 hours as a courier at Amazon, you don't have the common sense to buy a parcel box, you only know how to complain, you have the impression that you have to let the courier treat you as if you were their boss, you have demands and some of you don't even say thank you for a correct order, not to mention those of you who lie that the packages haven't arrived, let the courier lose his job, some ….you are , in your work you will have a share of this",1
"I'm really happy of the service I got from Amazon. Good package, good product, fast delivery.The best ecommerce website.",2
"UNTRUSTWORTHY, and are NOT to be believed!.......PERIODProve me incorrect!",0
"I have been an Amazon customer since the mid 90's. I don't expect any company to be 100%. Amazon is so big now they just aren't trying. Kindle software stinks the past year, customer assistance is unavailable, and no one in charge cares further than the stock price. I was a huge fan. Now I am looking for the competition.",1
"I've been ordering from Amazon since October 2016. I got to know of them when I stayed in the US for a couple of months for technical and hands-on training. I've experienced delays, items lost or damaged or even ""delivered"" but no one knocked and I was home the whole day. On the other hand, I've also experienced extra-early deliveries, being given freebies, and all that.In my years of online shopping, I've also bought from competitor platforms like Lazada, eBay, to name a few. I still buy from other platforms but what keeps me with Amazon is how I find their customer service to be. The quality is exactly what you would expect of an American company: customer-satisfaction-centered.Your experience may differ, but I can see myself ordering from Amazon for years to come simply because if they do it right, I am one happy customer; and if something is wrong, their customer service whether chat or call will get my problem resolved each time.",2
"What's the point of you? 99% of my orders are not delivered when you say they will be. The drivers deliver when they feel like it. Customer service is useless, they just ghost you. Bunch of imbeciles. Shocking is an understatement. What the hell are you doing?",0
"I ordered 3 tea cup sets on Amazon on January 3, 2024.  The products were coming from China from a third party vender.  The tracking information on Amazon said the teacup sets were on their way.  Later, the information on Amazon for my purchases claimed the packages were lost in transit.  It was recommended I wait for shipment to be found.  No follow-up from Amazon was made.  When I inquired about a refund, I was told the refund would be made and I got a email telling me the refund would be processed.  It appears they didn’t process the refund at all.  I spoke to Isabelle in customer service who now claims my earlier request on May 31, 2024 was not valid and now the time to request the refund was beyond the 6 months to make the claim.  The initial request on May 31, was within the 6 month time frame.  No remedy or refund will no longer be made by Amazon.  This company will not make good on the undelivered items without the customer making an inquiry.  I have been dealing with Temu who when an order is cancelled, a refund is issued within 48 hours without contacting Temu.  Needless to say, Amazon Prime does not make the customer whole within a reasonable time, as they track the purchases you make and forget you when the purchase cannot be delivered.",0
"I paid 10 Euro for expedited delivery and they have sent my order with regular delivery which by the way takes at least a week, so I won't be getting my items for over 7 days. After talking to support for over 40 minutes, they issued a refund for shipping. Same thing has happened about 2 months ago.... Horrible experience and I won't order from them anymore. They are either scaming people on shipping fees or have incompetent underpaid workers. How can you screw up shipping out a product when that's your only job?",0
What is not to like about amazon.  Prices clearly posted. Easy no arguing returns and credit.  Stores old purchases and searches.,2
"What ever I m looking for, I ve always found at a great price and prompt shipping with secure tranactions. Their offering of various modes of payment and shipping addresses works for me.",2

"I have been an amazon customer for many years and a prime subscriber for nearly as long. Recently, i have notices a sharp decline in the service provided by Amazon, most notably, their inability to deliver items on time or even on the same day. I order a pair of headphones for next day delivery which were dispatched that day, then shipped in the early hours, the item was sent out for delivery and a slot for delivery was sent. This time came and went and a corporate apology e mail sent. Having waiting in all day, I had to go out and at 9pm, I received a call, stating a delivery was attempted but i was not in. Driver said he would deliver following day. Today, i have been informed that the item has been sent back to the local sorting office and a delay has been experienced in delivery and no one knows (or cares, as they have my money) why or when i will receive the item and this is on the Prime service.This is FAR FROM A PRIME SERVICE and is happening more often than not now. Not only to you pay your annual subscription, you also pay a PREMIUM PRICE for PREMIUM DELIVERY which doesn’t occur. I have attempted to speak with customer service who just read out and repeat the scant information from the tracking info. In reality, the delivery companies take on work beyond their abilities in their greedy pursuit of wealth and when things go wrong, they just brush the problem aside and carry on as if nothing has happened, they have no real strategy for dealing with balls ups. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and I shan’t be using Amazon anymore, there are better and more reliable options out there. This seems to be my only option now and i advise others to do the same and save their money! NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
I am usually a huge amazon fan!  reason for only 4 stars is that sometimes their returns process is frustrating!  I am sure dealing with all the returns they must receive on a daily basis must be frustrating for this company as well tho!,2
"Would you please fix your search engine?  Perhaps Google could help.  When I search for an ""RTX 3080"" the booleans mean that my search should not display RTC 3090's, 3070's, 3060's or AMD graphics cards.  I have 2 battery orders sitting here that are useless to me because they popped up in a search where they shouldn't have.  Some of these button batteries have several names.  Can't I count on your search engine to get it right?",1
"Usually my amazon deliveries are great, but only when I deliver to my mother's home as they always put my parcel behind the wheelie bin if no one is home or just in general preferred space even if I'm home and they take a photo to let me know. However, when ordering, make sure to check what area you live in cause some areas are prone to either stealing your parcels if its small. I ordered 2 mascaras recently and it was suppose to come Thursday and suddenly I get a notification it's delivered today and left in the letterbox when it was not there at all, so disappointed, I'm never going to order to my apartament as my parcels are always never delivered, only if they're large parcels then they arrive as I'm shown tracking, and it arrives to me as I wait downstairs, also depends who delivers it, but when it comes to small packages it's always a problem, I'm awaiting a refund and re delivered same item to new address. Plus I didn't get a tracking map this time for this one  the shipment just flew out of nowhere, it kept saying delivering tomorrow then today and just switching up.",1
"So far, they have been good, consistent.  But now in 2024 they have gone to A.I. Customer Service that is just programmed response in which you will not get your refunds even if you deserve them.  ",2
I love amazon especially 2 day free shipping wow amazing.,2
Being a prime member always receive orders in a timely manner,2
Okay I have to give 3 stars but will explain. Amazon them self is truly 5 star I have had issues with not receiving items especially from 3rd party’s (scammers) and they refund ASAP and for that I would give them 5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ I have to drop 2 stars because of their shipment support is always mysteriously losing  my packages that usually are electronics although they refund me I have to  wait a few days till they see if it is gonna be delivered before they even speak to you about it. Normally it be okay but these last to was for my flight that the refunding and reordering it will not be here in time. I know they contract shipment company but they need to get this under control. I’m not the only one with this issue.,1
I really love Amazon.Very efficient service.Huge variety of products.As a buyer all my purchases came at good prices and very fast sometimes even up to the house.(Without going to the post office)About Amazon salesI never sold there.But I heard a good friend of mine selling there.That the warehouse service is excellentAnd everything you store there in warehouses you get e-mail while it is sold.Which is a very convenient service.Regarding the Company's shares and the rate of growth.I bought the stock in the 900 and sold in the 1600 area.At its peak it reached $ 2000 per unit.I really think all the work for Jeff BezosAbout what he managed to create.RegardsAlon Fertig,2

After leaving honest reviews about products that were purchased from Amazon.com (mostly positive with a couple negative) Amazon has banned me from leaving reviews. After contacting via live chat an Amazon representative told me there was nothing they could do and would not tell me why I was deemed unworthy of being a consumer with a voice. Terrible and shady business practices. If you don't want to get banned from Amazon make sure that you never leave a negative review on a purchase...,0
Very fast shipping! Interested!,2
"As a matter of fact, amazon had been quite satisfying since I first used their assistances years ago.Though, the past few years I find quite annoying their borderline policy about shipment date. There was a time when that shipment date was fixed. Now it changes even in previously received mails. The only way to keep track of their promises is to make a screenshot. The most irritating things is that every time you write to complain about undelivered items and warn other users, amazon refuse your review. They even remind you stupidly that your review should focus on the item quality.  How are you supposed to do that without even receiving the item ?",1
I love shopping in Amazon.,2
"Very very bad.since this exprience preffer use Ebay.they are much better than amazon if anything happend.I ordered a camera with the case via amazon and in the package was only case.somebody stolen the camera,wrote this to amazon.also reported a crime at police,and no help at all,amazon stopped answer me an polices argument was not enough proofs,If that happened with ebay,what did to me once.their service was amazing,refunded me what the lost.",0

"Amazon's ARC insurance company for driver property damages is terrible and will not send adjusters to assess damages. They will say anything to get out of paying claims no matter how much evidence you provide. Thier intent is to force you to hire attorneys! Amazon should be ashamed for using them! I have extensive property damage caused by lazy drivers coming onto my property caught by cameras that prove my case and yet ARC wants to send me a $50 ""goodwill gesture"" for thousands of dollars in damages. Claiming I have no evidence!Here is an email comment verbatim from ARC: ""Thank you but we will not for claims over time and you have no evidence. Also that was a goodwill gesture but we will not pay for damages that were not caused. Please have your attorney email this file and our attorney will respond. Have a great day. I will cancel the goodwill gesture.""ARC cannot even provide proper grammar let alone deal with Amazon drivers' incompetence.",0

I like the convenience of it but my deliveries are constantly being delayed.,1
I just used Amazon and ordered an item with a great review and the item arrived and works as well as the reviews state so I wished to also leave a review for the item but according to Amazon guidelines I need to spend $50 or more a month to be eligible to review... so Amazon is getting an Average score from me for not allowing me to review a goods.  Terrible policy if you ask me.,1

I am a vivd purchaser on Amazon books and other hardware. The best price and shipping dont always seem to be in par with reality. Great selection but quality is not what I expect.,1

I probably spend 100K a year+ here for my business.they keep trying to get me to have a business account but from what I was told it would nix the free shipping on a ton of items.. why would I do that? it just doesnt seem worth it.,1
"I started receiving packages from Amazon that I did not order.  I contacted Amazon with all the information and was told several things but never received a fix.  I was told they would conduct an investigation and contact me, the first several times within 7-10 days then 24-48 hours about the fourth time.  Never received a response, was even told by customer service to view it as a golden opportunity as I was receiving things I didn't order.  I received a CC bill from my CC company that is not associated with Amazon nor on my account with several charges I did not authorized.  Obviously someone got access to my CC information and was using it but Amazon did nothing to stop this.  AT&T Universal who has my CC was outstanding, reversing all the charges and issuing me a new card.  Called Amazon again to let them know about the problem and that a fraud was taking place and they could not be less interested.  If you are receiving 9 of the same paintings, 40 steak knives, 20 bottles of soap and many other items in the same amounts someone in the Amazon fraud department should take notice.  They didn't care than and don't care now even when the CSR admits the items and amounts are obviously an attempt at fraud.  I'm good and my CC company will get their money back from Amazon and Amazon just really doesn't seem to care either way so guess they make so much money that issues like this just are not a concern.  Make sure you check all your accounts not just the ones you have linked to your Amazon account.  They will not help you.",0

I have boughten many great items from Amazon and feel great to be able to find what I'm looking for with easy to find items at the best price. I also have the Amazon Prime to get the free shipping in less than two days. I highly recommend Amazon.Com to anyone looking for the best sales.,2

Love using Amazon! So easy and orders always come on time!,2
"I unfortunately don’t have the representatives names, but I had an item never show up. I contacted the customer support for a replacement. The lady who I first talked to LIED saying she could expedite the replacement and get it to me in 2 days. After 4 days, it still never showed up and the statement on my order said Jan. 8. The lady whom I talked to after the 2nd order was placed, said they could not expedite any replacement item and was quite surprised another representative would tell me that. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon who has an usaged representative LIE TO A CUSTOMER. However, the Second Lady who Told me they could not expedite my order was nothing but absolutely wonderful.",1

"I have been an amazon prime member for yrs, Fraudulent charges were made on my Amazon account at the end of April, so because I disputed the charges Amazon locked me out of my prime account,(to be expected), except they didn't stop there, no they decided to rob me of my thousands of dollars in movie and music purchases, and all of my Amazon devices when they also deemed it appropriate to lock me out of my prime movie and music accounts, not to mention none of my Amazon Alexas and echos will work due to all being registered to my account that had fraudulent activity... So then I called Amazon and confirmed I did not make those purchases dozens of times and here we are 4-5 months later and I'm still locked out of all my stuff and services that have already been bought and paid for??? Which is weird, I have never had the clerk from the grocery store come into my house and take all the food I just bought from my fridge, freezer, and pantry.... I have never had the manager of kohls show up at my house and confiscate the school clothes I just bought for my children.... I am not sure why Amazon thinks it is acceptable to remove access to movies and music that have already been PAID for... Or how they think it is appropriate to block the functionality of my devices that have already been PAID for with the understanding they would FUNCTION!!! I am beyond disgusted with treatment and handling of this whole situation.... I'm honestly not even sure it's legal.... It seems alot like theft to me... I honestly don't ever want to purchase anything from Amazon ever again after this and neither do family and friends... a full refund for ALL of my movies, music, and devices would be appreciated",0
Overall I rate Amazon as A-.  Deliveries are sometimes optimistic in that the date given prior to ordering is sometimes altered after placing an order. When an order does go wrong (infrequently) Amazon usually pull out all the stops to remedy the situation.,2
"Amazon failed to deliver an item 3 times - then did not refund me then failed to close my account and delete my data as requested ( breaching the data protection act ) They purposely make closing the account difficult to do and ""no on is available on the phone "" - reason is they are too busy making huge amounts of money while ignoring customer service - blame the virus !!!! they are coining it in",0
"I always find myself going back to amazon becouse there prices are so acceptable, however i have had several ordinary usages while buying from resellers that are allowed to advertise on there site, with one order taking two weeks to arrive, the real sting in the tail was that the HD-dvd went bust a couple of weeks later",1

I am always very pleased with Amazon and shop here often,2
This is a minus 10 review rating. I ordered 2 items for delivery today and although they haven't arrived their status shows as delivered. Customer services say I have to wait another 2days for my order to arrive. What is the point of having amazon prime if I cannot choose the delivery I want?,0
"I have a love/hate relationship with Amazon. I order from them all the time, especially the last few years because it is easier than having to go out and search our local stores for particular items, that often times are not in stock or simply not available where I live. I have also often searched for other online stores to purchase items from but rarely do I find one where I can get free shipping and a lower price. So, though it pains me to do so, if I need to place an order for certain items, I shop on Amazon. That being said, the customer assistance I personally have received has been pretty awesome, the majority of the time. The key is NOT to buy from a third party seller, as that is a huge headache, in my own interaction. Also, you cannot write a review that directly complains about Amazon because they will not ""approve"" it. Which is ridiculous because we all know that Amazon has gone way downhill since the early days. However, that being said, it is possible to get a refund, make a return, and get your money back if you NEVER receive your package. It is a bit of a pain in the a** but it can be done be done. What it takes is patience, persistence, and knowing how to navigate the system. I recently was given a large gift card credit to spend simply because I had such an issue with shipping and it was days past the time my package should have arrived with an item that was an 1/8 of the price of the credit I was given. I used a gift card to purchase it, so I was happy with that. I am the person who manages to get my refunds AND I often get my items for free because I do NOT take NO for an answer. I am polite (for the most part), kind, calm and I do NOT give up. I have interactiond many problems with shipping, missing items, items delivered to the wrong apartment, poorly made items, poorly packaged items, items not arriving on time,etc.etc. And each time, customer assistance has taken care of me. Sometimes it takes more than one phone call and asking for a supervisor, explaining the situation over and over again, but in the end the result is in my favor. I actually fill out the survey the customer assistance agents email me after the phone call. I am honest and thorough when I fill them out and I praise those exceptional agents who go the extra mile for me, as I appreciate excellent assistance, as I have been in there shoes in the past. However, if I can find an alternative to shopping at Amazon that also offers free shipping and lower prices, I take it. I would love nothing more than to not have to order another item from them. Obviously, the company treats their employees like crap, the quality of many of their items is merde, they often price gouge, many of their reviews are bogus, the packages are usually not packaged properly or poorly packaged, returns have become a huge pain, many third party sellers rip people off, it can take longer to receive refunds and reviews have to be approved(utter.bullsh**.) Jeff Bezos is making money hand over first, while not paying the amount of taxes or any at all on the billions of dollars he has made and not caring one iota about his employees or his customers. This is what happens when we end up with monopolies and extremely few options available to us. My goal this year is to buy less, continue to search for other online businesses to shop from (especially local ones) and continue to vote, sign petitions and work towards changing the current status quo.",1
"It’s pretty ironic that a company that got its start delivering books can no longer seem to accomplish this simple task.  I receive my mail and packages at a mailbox store, which has normal business hours.  I have noted this in the delivery instructions on my Amazon profile, and even entered their hours of operation.  Yet Amazon delivery people keep trying to deliver packages after hours, and the mailbox store employees routinely find Amazon packages that have been dumped at their front and back entrances.  Despite the fact that they have posted large signs telling Amazon drivers not to do this, that all deliveries must be brought inside during normal business hours.  Lately I’ve had experiences where whatever I order, if it’s being sent by Amazon delivery it shows,”Will be delivered by 10pm today”.  And then the item never shows up.  Seriously? First of all, who wants a delivery person banging on their door at 10 pm, and secondly, it seems that Amazon doesn’t actually take into account their customer’s delivery instructions.  There are other online retailers who don’t seem to have a problem with simple things like delivering an item that I’ve ordered, so I will be canceling my “Prime” membership and shopping elsewhere.",0

Having a large notice saying to Ring the doorbell, they often can't be bothered so you know notice of the shipment.For me the cost of the prime is not worth the money as I don't want music or any of the other so called perksI would take up prime at a cheaper change for shipment only.",1
"Amazon is a very acceptable assistance, however I can find nowhere to report a discrepancy between the comment the order driver made and the actuality! The comment read “handed to resident”. Not so, we were in and listening for the order - having tracked it. But no ringing of the bell or knocking of the door, just dumped.I’ve tried to find a place on their web site to report this - it’s not the first time - to no avail!! Sad really as parcels they send by Royal Mail or other assistance always come with a ring or knock!! Making this a reliably, safe order. That’s really is my only complaint about an otherwise very acceptable company!",1

"I have been an Amazon customer since the very beginning - in the UK, the US and now France. I think their service quality is astonishingly good. Living in rural France it is a lifesaver. Just recently I have had my first returns and they were handled quickly and without fuss - maybe thanks to my many, many orders over the years. I think they should pay far more tax and pay their employees way more money - and I'd be happy to pay an extra 15% if I was confident it was going to staff wages.",2
"It was a time when Amazon was a really acceptable company,  but now it seems to be just another one just like the other. One of my problems I have with them is their shipment.  I'm a prime member and have been for years but now that doesn't matter to Amazon.  We order often and our home sits slightly up off of the street in a cul de sac and we have the ring and it shows them delivering. I have called, complained and also written instructions with orders and on the account not to walk in the yard on the grass but only walk on the driveway. Well no one cares and they park at the driveway and walk straight through our yard which is well taken care of. Years back they never did this and they have no respect for the customers property.  I will be canceling my prime and shop for what I need elsewhere. ",1

This is a company that treats its own delivery people, employees and  customers equally badly and it should not be supported. ",0

"XPO Logistics is the worst company ever. I ordered a play house for my granddaughters on Amazon . XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the order provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the item somewhere else. I am not ordering anymore large items from Amazon if they are going to keep using this company. XPO Logistics  has horrible customer support!!!! Amazon has not done anything about this organization that they paired up with.",1

"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a support that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this support. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid.

I love Amazon!! I’ve been a loyal Amazon and prime customer for years. Amazon is very fair and they have great refund and return policies. They deliver fast and smoothly (sometimes same day delivery) and take pictures of their deliveries to notify you when your package arrives. Amazon has a wide variety to choose from. Also a large variety of prices for each item.. you get what you pay for. I have hundreds of orders with Amazon over the years  and only 2 refunds. One for a box spring and and the other for a dent puller.,2
Some of the items were fake.,1

"A seller outside amazon sent me a parcel on 29th of march via Amazon Shipping. It was supposed to be delivered on 3rd April. It has been 5 days since then and I still havent received my parcel yet. Neither the tracking status has been updated. Called the customer service 5 times and every time I heard ""Sir it will be delivered by tomorrow surely"" and that 'tomorrow' never came. Their service is literally pathetic. Neither are they ready to give me the address of the hub it has reached or any other leads. All they are saying that they have escalated a complain and just fooling me on every single call. Never opt for amazon shipping for courier, its the most pathetic delivery service I have ever experienced. Dear Jeff, if you ever look at this grief, please think upon your decision of starting this courier service. The employees you have hired are probably not good or qualified enough niether do they care about customer.",0
I like amazon! Very quick delivery and good website! Easy and good recommendations,2
"I've been ordering from Amazon since October 2016. I got to know of them when I stayed in the US for a couple of months for technical and hands-on training. I've experienced delays, items lost or damaged or even ""delivered"" but no one knocked and I was home the whole day. On the other hand, I've also experienced extra-early deliveries, being given freebies, and all that.In my years of online shopping, I've also bought from competitor platforms like Lazada, eBay, to name a few. I still buy from other platforms but what keeps me with Amazon is how I find their customer service to be. The quality is exactly what you would expect of an American company: customer-satisfaction-centered.Your experience may differ, but I can see myself ordering from Amazon for years to come simply because if they do it right, I am one happy customer; and if something is wrong, their customer service whether chat or call will get my problem resolved each time.",2
I ordered a toy for my grandson on the 15th December. I received a e-mail from Amazon saying it would be delivered to my local hub on Tuesday 20th Dec giving me tracking and order numbers. I cancelled my Amazon account on the 21st Dec. I have never received the toy but amazon were VERY QUICK to TAKE the £39.99 out of my credit card.I have phoned them and they say because I do not have an account with them they cannot do anything!! They still KEPT the money though and the TOY!!! Absolutely left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing and appauling customer service. Will NOT be using them ever again,0
One of my best and favor trust-able online shop is amazon only i never try others,2
"I’m really impressed with Amazon. I’ve been a customer for years and still no problems. Recently, I was worried that a product was late. I raised this with Amazon and they returned all costs.",2
I ordered 2 sets of Cushions. Each set had 5 numbers of cushions.The delivery guy just delivered 1 set only. The stupid unfriendly app does not have any place to capture it. Inspite of putting it in product review and delivery review no one from the company is interested in resolving my concern. I rated 1 star because there is no scope to score less than that here.,0
I never had a problem with Amazon but today I tried to call and report a package that was not delivered I was hung up on 18 times called Brooke because I didn't have money in my account because everything was coming out my account I was talking to you very rudely I don't ever want to order from y'all again,0
"I have been using Amazon more and more. I can always find the products I am wanting. Unusual items can be found and with prime delivery it is hassle free. The app is so easy to use. I love it. Only small downside is that some of the next day deliveries don’t arrive on time however these are few and far between. On occasions I gave gad to contact customer services, they have resolved the issue. Returns are easy. Overall a very happy customer. ",2
Getting worse and worse in both organization and customer service!,0

"Order item 7th October and was told it would be delivered by 14th October.  After wasting 3 days waiting for this parcel, I was told by the message bot to wait until 19th and contact again. Do they not realise people and  life and work.",1
No respect for the parcel and being delivered by just throwing it over a gate as if there rubbish.This is not the first time and trying to make contact with amazon is a joke unless you want one of there Faq's answered. The company just doesnt care like there drivers.,0
Great company but very confusing.  When is an item from Amazon and when is it not.  When can you get support and when are you stuck with no returns policy?That and they are killing mom and pop local stores.,1
"I asked them to check the package before send it out.  They said give me the replacement without return process because of appreciation of my concern and comment   However, they sent an email to return it.  I never asked to return item.  Therefore, I canceled that replacement item.  They lied and played with my time and so disappointed.",0
"This is more of a review on Amazon service!I took in a parcel from Amazon, for the property next door. It is a rental property and it turns out that the family moved out before Christmas so are not aware that I have this parcel.I took a photo of the label on the front and contacted Amazon to see if they could either trace the recipient so they can tell them to come and collect it, or at least arrange for one of their drivers to collect it and take it back to the depot.However on contacting Amazon I was told there was no way they can do this, and I can either keep the parcel or dispose of it!!Either of these options make me very uncomfortable, as it feels totally wrong!It does make me wonder how many goods are just kept or disposed of by people who are being neighbourly and basically doing Amazon’s job for them! I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here. What on earth would I do if they did that and I told them “ oh sorry, Amazon said I could just keep it “ I would be mortified.So my advice is, don’t take in anyone else’s parcels unless you know the neighbour well enough to know they haven’t moved house!",2
Great service. Received order on time as promised!,2
I have done everything humanly possible to stop an order from Amazon of a dog bowl I didn't order but nothing works. I ordered two in August and had them delivered. Fine. The one that's coming now I didn't order and yes it's a cheap item but what if had been very expensive? No wonder people get away with fraud with this kind of security. I have been with them for years and it's never happened before. Is it a trial run?Sorry Amazon but you deserved this!,0
You have to wonder what idiot decided packing a $500 rifle scope in the same box with a 40lb bag of dog food was a fine idea.,1
Normally very fine but the last 2 orders have not gone well one never arrived and other came damaged managed to get they swapped but it took allot of emails and hassle might shop local going forward,1
"I have brought lots of things from Amazon and I do love the company, however I ordered something so exciting in about March time and it never ever turned up, I got an email saying they had received the order but it never turned up, need my money back 😩",1
Stop using your leverage to torture common people.,0
"So annoyed with amazon. Certainly won’t be using again. Been a prime member for years but not again.Arranged a return pick up for my one day off this week. Sat in the whole day and they didn’t turn up.Amazon arranged DPD to pick up next morning. They did, and then Evri turned up later to also pick up.The next day DPD try to drop the parcel back at mine, no reason just it’s down as a delivery to me. Listening inside the box can also tell the item now damaged, loose parts Refused delivery.Trying to get my money back from Amazon a nightmare.Decided to go back to shopping on the high street, refusing to do online.",0
"Absolute worst company ever. Their customer service is terrible. I don’t know how they can possibly stay in business if this continues. In the past month, I’ve ordered 20 items. 5 of them have been late, 2 have been the wrong thing, and 2 never arrived. Of these 20 items, I’ve returned a total of 4 items. 2 because they were the wrong thing and 2 because they just were not what I was expecting.Of the two that never arrived, Amazon was so reluctant to refund me, they kept telling me to wait it out. The most frustrating thing was my orders showed if the item didn’t arrived by “__”date, then I should return and I would be refunded. When I did this, they asked me to wait longer. After reattempting this 3 times over the course of 6 days, each time they did the same thing. Finally, I was refunded. 2 other items I’ve chatted about and the reps have told me on separate occasions that I don’t need to return the item and I would be refunded. I then donated the items because they were what I needed, and a week later, I have no refunds. I chatted with their CS and they said I needed to return the items in order to be refunded. I told the reps that I didn’t have them anymore because I donated them since the last reps told me I didn’t need to return the items. You can guess how this ended… no refund. I told Amazon that I would send them a screenshot from the previous reps. They still would not refund me, they said that the other reps made a mistake and that I still would need to return the items. I am absolutely dumbfounded. These people just don’t get it. I’ve never seen a company contradict themselves more than Amazon. It is beyond frustrating. Their CRM system or whatever they use is horrendous. How terrible customer service that you don’t keep previous customer correspondence or stick to your word. It’s complete bogus. This company used to be pretty good, but now it’s the most frustrating company to purchase from. So sickening.",0

"Bought several presents in the days before Christmas. Was delivered at 8pm the day before, but they did keep their promise! I don't know how they do it!",2
"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of interactions with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only decent thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1
I have recently purchased an item from Amazon and the delivery  date was around 3 weeks which i thought was acceptable. 3 weeks passed so checked on my account and it stated item might be lost? Contacted seller and was sent an email to confirm my delivery address? I replied this have been provide when i purchased the item. By mirical a week later the item turned up in very poor state. To my surprise the item was sent from China which i had no knowledge of. I contacted Amazon  and i was told that the info was there but only if you gone through all the literature which i think is deceaving and should have been highlighted with the description of the item.Amazon said will look into this but it's  dissaponting and a bit late for me.Be aware of this,0
Great choices and excellent service every time I order.,2
Legit scam. Took $79 out of my bank at random without any email or pre-warning stay away from these guys!,0
I have had several interactions between sellers not actually Amazon on your site and have been totally amased at Amazon's immediate response in correcting the issue your ratings only go to 5 stars in my dealings with Amazon I would most certainly rate your service at 10 stars twice what is able to rate you at thank you so much for being above and beyond what any person could ever expect,2
Amazon overall deliver a decent assistance but it can fall down when some of its suppliers provide a very average assistance. In my case I bought 3 cat Webbox  sticks from Staks and Co. They offered no return assistance. I paid £8.19which I had assumed  was for 3 X 3 packets of Webbox Cat sticks and so I paid £8.19. They sent me 3 so i paid £2.73 eachper  packet when they only cost £1.00 in Morrisons. Don't use Staks and Co unless you are very rich.   Oh and no returns.,1
"A few weeks ago I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a sewing machine, for those of you who don’t know, this isn’t a cheap purchase by any means. So to save a few dollars I buy a factory refurbished model being sold by Amazon, great reviews, all the bells and whistles, and roughly $150 worth of included accessories. Order showed up a day early and I’m super excited to set it up and start figuring this machine out, but much to my disappointment when I unpacked the box none of the accessories were there except for one, or so I thought. In my disappointment I started a return when I was offered a replacement item to be shipped to me next day and I had a month to return to one I had with missing pieces for free, using a UPS pickup, just had to confirm that it I didn’t return the item the full cost would be charged to my original payment method, which couldn’t happen, this was a splurge, but since I was absolutely returning it I wasn’t worried about this and agreed. Since I was bored and decided that I could still mess around with the machine without the optional accessories that were to be included I set it up and started reading through the manual when in it I discovered basically a hidden storage compartment in the base of the machine. Open it up and ta-da there’s my “missing” accessories. So I hurry up and try to cancel the replacement but it has already shipped so I can’t, okay no problem I’ll just return it when it gets here. While laughing with my mom about my little blonde moment she mentions that she would like to learn to sew and wants to buy this machine off of me, okay no problem I just have to get ahold of Amazon and have them change the payment method they will charge when I don’t return it since I didn’t want the charge on a credit card. Contact CS through the chat feature and explain that I no longer wish to return either machine and that I need to pay for the replacement one but need to change my payment method. CS Rep asks me to wait for a few moments while she sees if this is something she can do, when she responds she says that she is unable to change the payment method after an order has been placed, but that I haven’t been charged. Confused at this point I tell her I know I haven’t been yet because I was to return one machine but that I will no longer be returning it and I agreed to be charged the full amount for both if I didn’t send one back and that I was just trying to pay for the second machine. At this point she tells me she understands all of this, and that what she was trying to say is that she will switch the replacement to a return so that I can keep both machines and not be charged for the second one. At this point I’m floored, but this was my mistake, and I’m not trying to not pay for it, I just want to use a different card to pay for it, why should Amazon give me a free machine just because I can’t change a payment method on a machine I wouldn’t have even needed shipped to me had I dug a little deeper in search of the accessories? Again she confirms that I can keep both machines with no charge for the second machine, also that she will send me email confirmation of this at my request, just in case a charge shows up on my card because this seems to good to be true. Within 30 seconds of ending the chat I have email confirmation of keeping both machines and not being charged for the second one. Wow. Thank you Amazon, you made myself and my mother very very happy yesterday. Never would have dreamed I would end up with a free mid level Brother sewing machine by contacting Amazon in an attempt to PAY for said sewing machine just because they don’t have the ability to change my payment method. Still in shocked disbelief, I guess the karma gods were happy with me yesterday.",2
"I have been an Amazon Prime member for at least 15 years and until the past 6 months to a year, I would have given Prime a 5-star review.  However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day shipment any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the support altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the support gets any worse.  I truly hate to see this happening because Amazon Prime has been a lifeline for me for years...my go-to when I needed something shipped to me fast and reliably.",1
"Very very big let down this company , they collected a package on 11th march and it should have been delivered today 12th March.

Fantastic deals on tech and digital media. Wouldn't buy hard to find groceries from there though. Cancellations and refunds are a breeze.,2
Slowly descending into obsolete. Step your game up!,1
I have been using Amazon for a while and really like their customer support. I wish they audit sellers on the platform properly because many ship from china and return policy is not clear on those. ,1
I have been in Amazon prime customer for years now I understood during covert some orders were delayed but it is past that point now over and over multiple times Amazon says next day delivery and then they turn around and deliver it to me over a week later I called Amazon to complain about this and they said no it is only next day delivery from the date we ship it that is total BS everything is next day delivery from the day you ship it if it takes a day to get to you I pay $100 plus a year for next day delivery and Amazon considers if you order something on Sunday you'll receive it on Thursday and that they consider next day delivery it is total fraud it is a total ripoff Amazon prime not worth the money save your money shop on eBay,0

"I buy as little as possible from Amazon, and I try to avoid the companies owned by Bezos.  I buy hardcover books from 'other' online sellers, however, sometimes Amazon is the only place to find a product at a 'fair' price.I'm writing this review because Amazon edited  a review of mine regarding Hikari LED headlights.  I gave the Hikari a single star because of the failure of 1 of the lights failing within 4 months of installation.  Amazon changed it to 2 stars and edited my rather short text, which was polite and straight forward.",0

"I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th. I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.",1

"This is what online shopping should be, this is by far the best experience I've had with online ordering, I have been using eBay as long as I can remember but when they started letting people sell fake/knock off items I had to cut down a bit, but even the $13 a month for Amazon Prime is honestly not bad at all, it just ensures that you will get the majority of your items in 2 days, which is Awesome no matter who you are, and it also allows me to watch shows and movies that I do not own all for the Prime fee, I swear idk if I can shop anywhere else after my recent great experiences shopping with them, I see why they're taking over, I only wish I had jumped on earlier, Definitely Recommend !!",2
"Haven't experienced any difficulties buying different products on this platform. It's intuitively clear, plus of course it's the biggest retail marketplace in the world. I frequently skim through different stuff to buy something, one may say that I am a shopaholic, maybe, I ain't exclude. But the fact that Amazon delivers parcel in time, never delivers bad packages or something, everything's always on the highest level. I sometimes have hardships finding something I really need, because the assortment is huge, but these are just trifles, yeah?",2

"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has fine infrastructure (fast order, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1
Always good experiences. Whenever bad their customer services sorts it out :) just wish prime was cheaper,2
"We use amazon prime regularly. Before we ordered it gave us next day delivery, so we placed our order. Then we received an email saying it would be five days.

I've moved the GPS marker to the correct location on the map amazon use AND added delivery instructions...all to no avail.

I stick with them because of the ease of these returns. They have made shopping so easy and I can find almost anything. I also love reading all the reviews, which helps me decide what to get. ￼",2

They keep saying that one of my packages will get here today but the other two are already out for delivery and the other one is not even out. This is ridiculous. If they can’t deliver on the dates that THEY provided, they need to give accurate days of when it will actually get here. This has happened twice, they had plenty of time to ship it but they waited till the morning of the day that it is supposed to be delivered to ship it.",0

"I purchased an incorrect item back in Nov 2018. Upon opening the package, I realized my mistake. I immediately applied for a refund, got my refund code, prepared the package to be sent back, and paid for the shipping back to the seller.I contacted Amazon in mid-December after I realized the package had been delivered but my refund had not been received. They told me it could take some time and that they would take care of everything. I left it at that.I had not received anything nor heard from Amazon into early January, so I contacted them again. I got the same response but they were escalating it to their complaints department. Great?!?! now I had to wait for them to get back to me again.I had not received any communication since contacting Amazon earlier in the month. I was getting annoyed. I contacted them for the third time and I got the exact same run around that I was given earlier. I was given three days to hear back from Amazon to see if I can even get my refund.It went from a simple return to the potential I won't even get it.

"Amazon, as many people will probably agree, is very useful and inexpensive. You can find a mixture of good and bad products. I will say, even though Amazon's cheap, remember to check other sites, because I was looking for a Disney animator doll, and on Amazon it was more expensive than on shopdisney (It's gone down in price now on Amazon, but point is, at the time it was more expensive, so don't just trust Amazon to give you the CHEAPEST offers.) I like the fact that if there's a problem with a product, they'll let you return it.",2
"I think that these are the main core main issues of Amazon that makes Amazon anti-customer friendly.1) Want to use Amazon Prime Now? Sadly, you don't get free order, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour order. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for order. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's. We're expected to watch content on our phones but we can't control what we do, even though membership cost is ridiculous.",1
I really love amazon prime.  Never really had any issues with them.  I did get automatically billed the other day which I was not aware of.  Later found out that it’s an automatic bill cycle once every year.  I guess I should have read that.  Maybe you can guys can send out a reminder on when this is due?  Other than that the service has been awesome for my small business.,2
Liars liars I ordered with them many times I get the lie they take money but care less about you DO NOT USE amazon I mean run not walk RUN!!!!!! I will never recommend this company to anyone ever,0
"My Amazon Fresh order was due to be delivered between 12 and 2 pm on the day of delivery.When the order didn't arrive by 2pm I contacted customer services. The first representative told me that they couldn't get in contact with the driver and asked me to try - I couldn't contact the driver either. They then said they were going to refund the order. I agreed. Later they said that the driver was ""in my area"" and would be no later than 4pm ""Max"".Due to the cost of living I didn't have the budget to go and buy more food so I only had the option to take more time out to wait in for the delivery.It didn't arrive by 4pm.I then contacted customer services again who told me that a FREE replacement would be sent out by midnight the same day. After a very long wasted day, time taken off work and an autistic son waiting to be fed, the replacement order arrived by 11:30pm.Today Amazon has taken the payment of £40 despite promising a full refund of the order.I contacted customer services again today and that representative told me that I would be charged the £40 and there was nothing that could be done about it.This has caused stress for both me and my son. I have written to customer services on the email address they provided but that was a few days ago, and they haven't even acknowledged receipt of my email. Needless to say I won't be ordering food from them again and will likely cancel my Prime membership also. Don't bother buying a Prime membership. Doesn't make a shred of difference tbh. And get your food elsewhere.",0
"Orders arrived next day, but driver left package in the bin, didn't leave a note/card and didnt take a picture. Found the package 2 days later when taking the bins out",1
"Most of Amazon customer service is garbage. They lie to customers over the phone or Amazon account chatting, Amazon should get rid of those rats customer services it's just a waste of $ there are not helpful.",0
I enjoy shopping on amazon. Great products. Gets most orders on time If there is a delay on an order they would send sms and email atleast a day or two before hand let me know. Never had a complaint. Will shop on amazon more.,2

Goodluck Cancelling your prime subscription took me over 4 weeks to cancel,0

"Their customer support needs a major improvement.  They need to watch for fake items and horrible sellers. I bought something special for my mom, received the wrong item, and they were mad at me for it.  Do something to fix your company Amazon.",1
Why has Amazon suddenly got so ridiculously more expensive than the shop. For example by Vileda active mop head £6.99 in Sainsbury's and everywhere else but £11.99 and more tab Amazon!  Shame on you cheat on people,1
"I ordered a patio umbrella on Aug. 1, 2021 on Amazon which I received. I have my credit card record showing the transaction. I needed to order a broken replacement part, only to discover there is no record of the purchase on Amazon itself in my order history so I contacted the company, Best Choice Products. They also had no record of my purchase. They can do nothing without my order ID number. I contacted Amazon Customer service chat online and repeatedly (3X) got what was obviously not a real person but an AI. I asked ""Are you a real person or an AI?"" and was told ""I am a real person"", but the responses were still like a programmed AI. I said, ""What is your favorite ice cream?"" because an AI would not be set up to respond. Sure enough, no answer. I wrote, ""I am not sure you are a real person so if you answer that question, I'll know."" The response: ""I am a real person"" which is the exact phrase that is always used. It's triggered by the phrase ""real person"". He refused to answer a simple question about ice cream so I knew it was an AI yet again. I finally gave up because it just kept going around in circles because its coding couldn't handle the complexity.  Shame on Amazon for lying to its customers that its customer service help are 'real people'.",0
"Oh Amazon, what would I do with out you.😀👌Amazing products, amazing price, lots of choices and above all, the best customer service ever. No one compares to amazon.",2
"There is always something wrong with Amazon.Starting from out of date food shipment, subscriptions with rising prices with every shipment.Ending on a useless document verification system, which is unable to verify documents accepted by ANY OTHER BRITISH company.That's why I quit my Prime membership after 6 years.",1
"I attempted to purchase something from Amazon and use a virtual Visa card which I was told BY THEM is basically like a credit card and I'd be able to use it! Then things took a ridiculous turn in that the card wouldn't work and in contacting their customer services team I got zero help. It's actually hilarious that in the end they sent me a total of 11 replies without managing to answer my actual query at all. I requested to make a complaint and continued to get conflicting information and random agents trying to tell me they were in charge yet continued to send me conflicting and useless information! I went and spent my money elsewhere in the end ...what a joke! I also ended up cancelling my Amazon unlimited account as there's nothing like shocking customer service to make you not want to give someone your money anymore - they were so unhelpful didn't seem like they wanted it.I have to admit this is the first time I've had an issue with Amazon ...I've been shopping with them for around 13 years, but this episode was pretty catastrophic and went on for about 2 weeks! I never did really get the response I was waiting for and that's why I gave up! I now prefer to use other online stores and eBay although I think Amazon is great for range of products, not interested in being treated like I don't matter as a customer again!",0
"I think Amazon is losing its control of deliveries. I am a Prime member and Amazon customer for over 10 years. This is the second time they tell me my package is probably lost. The first was a couple of months ago, a cordless vacuum I had to cancel the order after 10 days of no arrival. Now, I keep waiting for another order that has been tracked all the way to my local area. Its been four days and it now says that ""the package may be lost"". They have been very good in the past but I cant hide my disappointment when this happens. COMON, AMAZON..GET A GRIP!!! ",2
User friendly; hassle free.,2
I just don’t like about amazon is the customer cares just one thing. Always when the Usps fails on the day they supposed to deliver and they don’t. Why in the world like a customer do I have to call and fix it ? I’m paying for the support . They have to contact the postal office and fix it . That is why I’m paying for that support btw is not cheap . “Amazon prime”  I hope they can do something about it,1
I  buy  lots  of  things  with  amazon  if  there  is  a  problem  they  sort  it  quick  I  buy  all  my  dvds  cd  and  lots  of  other  items,2
Worst Service Ever had.Please don't use amazon service anymore,0
"Amazon's customer support has declined over the last years. Their 2 day shipping for prime members is great, but when there's an issue with an order their customer support lacks the support that they should be providing. ",1
Stole money for over a year for prime membership through an inactive account..,0
Very poor customer service.  Fail to deliver a 2 day shipment to my business.  Failed to know my business hours and delivered 2 day after we closed.  Failed to reattempt delivery.  Failed to know where my package is.  No representative wants take responsibility.,0
I bought a Product on Amazon which doesn’t work. I have initiated a return but neither the seller nor amazon customer service are returning my emails. I also wrote a review on the bad customer customer service on amazon which amazon refuses to to make public in their website. What about transparency for other customers? Both good and poor experiences shall be shared with the public.,0
"in general they do pretty well.   god help you if you want to leave feedback about them or their site.    their annoying gdamned app will message me all day long every few minutes about deals or hey do you wanna buy, or an order that I placed is going through step 500 of the 1000 things they'll tell me about, but they can't be bothered to tell me when/why an order I was looking for was cancelled or otherwise marked 'undeliverable'.   and trying to be able to talk to a person about this issue, or let them know that I think this is a problem?   I may as well pee into the wind and call it a hot shower, cuz ...  newp!   'customer assistance' means I get to do it myself through their website.it might be time for me to reconsider if I really want to  order anything from them again.",1
I opurchase some lite bulbs from Amazon recently and the service was good. One was broken on arival  and they replaced straight away. Thanks.,2
most sellers are not decent. But when you find a seller they provide decent stuff those are decent. add more quality control please!!,1
very disappointed with service that is so bad.,0
Absolutely rubbish still waiting on Xmas presents and other orders not turning up,0
"I am a blogger who writes about company reviews on any company I come across to. I am sure some of you will agree with me on this. I know someone who is a driver, and they better be treated respectfully.It is important to look around at other stores. I look at prices too. Online is a bigger issue with dealing with scams. Be careful where you shop online. Amazon is one of them.I was ranting while I was walking back from a store. I saw an Amazon truck. There seems to be a lot more nowadays. But this specific truck looked old, not the ones I usually see. I was curious of where this truck came from. Do drivers have to clean the truck themselves?. I feel bad for those drivers. I was really annoyed, no bathroom breaks?!. The warehouse employees are fired at the year 3 of how long they have been working. The company has stated that after three years, the employees are 'lazy'. They pay you to leave. Instead of fixing the speed of shipping, why not fix the employee situation?. These are human beings. Even the ones with color do not get treated fairly. Even though Amazon has a 'black lives matter' thing on their website or advertisements, it is lie.I say to myself, it is not just with the people you see at a store, to me, it is about the whole company, is the CEO willing to change something’s about their company. I hope the employees are striking for more respect, who does the harder work?, the employees. I still have not used the app. I am glad. I feel for those employees with the holiday season coming up.",0
"This is the worst and reliable company.

What a moron",0
Prime service is one of the most beautiful things in life,2
"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank decentness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your assistance we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
"Ordered a battery charger for same day delivery, waited all afternoon and evening and the parcel never turned up.Got an apology from the agent and told it would be sent the next day (today). today i get a message saying i will not recieve it till friday.I ended up cancelling the order nad will be closing my amazon account as soon as the refund is made.Its happened to me 3 times now, if they cant keep there promises then they shouldnt commit in the first place.",0

This company always comes through with their promises. Ordered so many items throughout the years and they NEVER fail to deliver. 100% recommended!,2
"The site has a lot of products, and the support is really good",2
"I use to only buy amazon but in the last year constant issues, from damaged items, very delayed shipments, to not refunding promptly after receiving my return. Subscriptions doubling in price on the 2nd shipment without notice, Finally, They don't allow me to write honest reviews if they are below a 5, they refuse to publish saying review doesn't fit their guidelines. Didn't Lowe's and Home Depot just get fined for that??",0
"Had a very bad experience, bought a camera from Amazon and the flash was not compatible, I was asked to return it which i did but i lost more than 300usd, they took 100usd for restocking and i spent over 300 usd for shipping expenses.  I regretted it.",0
"How is it legal that Amazon can inform you that your order has been delivered but it has not. You call Amazon and they inform you to give 24 hours for package to be delivered. It’s an outright lie. I leave in an apartment building. After receiving a message that it was delivered I assume a neighbor took it accidentally or it was stolen. Amazon claims drivers scan the package a day prior to delivery. WHAT They scan it the day before, package has not yet been delivered and Amazon informs you it has been delivered. Tell me this is legal.",0
"Constant brush off emails.  Anytime you complain they just tell you they are ""investigating"" and never do anything.  Also CS can't do anything other than refunds.  So the sellers bribe the Amazon Community managers to alter reviews,  and there is no way to report the transgressions.  Any attempts to contact are either fumbled by incompetent (and powerless CS),  or outright blocked by corrupt Amazon Community managers.",0
Very slow with shipment. Amazon Prime is not a fine deal either.,1
"Amazon scams people!!! I don’t order things from amazon often, but sometimes they do have some cool stuff. I ordered one thing. When I checked out there was option for a one time FREE prime delivery. I was then automatically charged for delivery as a separate transaction! It wasn’t a big charge so I decided to let it go, but now my package is two days late and I received an email that I will be charged monthly for a amazon prime account. You know the one I never wanted. I called the customer service and line and after talking to a stupid machine for 30 minutes I was transferred to a real person just to answer the same questions again! She said the package was delayed and won’t be here for 5 MORE DAYS!! No refund for the shipping. The free prime shipping trail is a scam. It is not free, and it is not any faster than the regular free shipping! My package was important and time sensitive and I would have paid for the faster shipping if I had known this would have been a huge issue! When I told the customer service rep that she immediately tried to refund me. I told her that I still wanted my item, but I wanted to cancel any further payments! VERY annoyed with the service of amazon in every aspect. I will not be order ever again unless this issue is resolved to satisfaction! It is not just OK for packages to be a week late and then receive no explanation!",0
Great price and super fast shipping.,2

"Purchase an item on the 24th aug 2023 , item was being sold by Amazon eu and advertised as in stock at time of sale . After sale I was informed delivery time to be confirmed. Nearly every day since purchase item has been advertised as in stock by Amazon eu . After contacting Amazon I was informed that the item was not in stock and also told that (in stock ) does not mean the item is in stock . Hear is what happened on 11/8/23 , the item said 13 in stock and while speaking the phone a Amazon advisor was able to tell me that there was now only 12 available while we were speaking, I asked the advisor could I not have one of the 12 and was told that is not how it works (lol) . So I pay for the item and Amazon won't deliver it but won't deliver it when it is clearly in stock and can't provide a delivery date . So if you see a item you like and is in stock, understand that the term (in stock ) written on a advertisement on Amazon platform does not actually mean (in stock) and what it does mean is very unclear.",0
I'm somewhat ashamed to admit it but Amazon has become the glue that keeps my life together. Their quick delivery has gotten me out of too many tricky situations on multiple occasions...,2
Prices are getting higher compared to a few years ago.Shipping seems to have gotten faster though,1
Amazon is just getting worst I’m paying for prime but never receive my packages when I’m suppose to so what’s the point of paying monthly for the benefits when you don’t get them,0
"I've been using my Son's Prime account for 5+ years & now need to use my own account.I'm at my wits end after several calls to Customer Service which seems to be someone in a foreign country each time.After I enter my email address in the box, Amazon sends me a numeric code that I successfully enter in a box.  The problem begins here; Amazon asks me for the expiration date of an old credit card that I haven't used in years because it was compromised & closed.No matter how many times I enter my email  & enter their security code, authenticate my address...the program always asks the same question...""what is the expiration date of an expired credit card""!I want my account restored using my email.  The suggestions from support were ""get a new email or use my phone number instead"".  I run my life using a central email & don't want non urgent texts coming to my phone & I certainly don't want Amazon telling me to change my phone number should another issue arise were I to use my phone number.I know Amazon has sophisticated business on the corporate side, but the retail side must know a credit card expiration date to an old expired card?I authenticated all other information correctly.  So my account exists, but is not accessible by anyone?",1
"Well, I never thought I would be writing a negative review about Amazon. After many years as loyal customers, and being a Prime member for many years, spending a lot of money, I find myself writing a negative review.Whilst being Prime members we have never had problems with faulty, not as described, not received goods, etc. Now we have cancelled out Prime membership, the customer service and customer support has become sub-standard. It just shows that you are not treated equally and there is no equality.If we had a problem with an item, the money was refunded either as soon as the item was returned or within a very quick period of time. Now we have cancelled our Prime membership, we have had nothing but trouble getting a simple refund for an item that was clearly sold '!s new' but was infact 'ex-display' and not as described. This is a clear cut case and should have warranted an immediate refund.After contacting the seller and getting no response, then one response, and no further response, we contacted Amazon. There was excuse, after excuse. They eventually said they would refund the money and said it will be in your account, but it wasn't.So bearing in mind they said they had refunded it! Two days later they send a message saying, ""your A-Z claim has been successful and we will be refunding you payment."" So the initial refund they said they had refunded, they had not actually refunded it. Now I will have to wait another 7 days for a refund. In total that will be 15 days from the item being received back by the seller.Why would you receive lesser customer service than a Prime member? Surely, all customers should receive the same customer service, after all we are all customers. Why is a non-prime member discriminated against? We are disgusted and disappointed in the service we have paid for, and this is not the experience we have become accustomed to over the many years with amazon.We have spend thousands of pounds with Amazon over the years. This will probably the last time we purchase from Amazon, and we will be closing both of our accounts with Amazon.",0
"I ordered an Amazon Fire stick. It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an shipment confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the shipment status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new shipment date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer support and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the decents never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too. Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund interaction. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.",1
"Many people to talk to, but no one who can really help your issue. They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a average mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",1
"I am consistently astounded at how good amazon is and it is now where I do most of my shopping for almost anything. The product reviews help me decide between multiple similar items and the price is always competitive.

But the fact that Amazon delivers parcel in time, never delivers bad packages or something, everything's always on the highest level.

"We bought a Danby DAR044A4WDD compact fridge after seeing 4 stars average from 594 Amazon customer reviews. Looked at questions answered also, stating the door was reversible. I took a minute to search by model number and there was ONE review on this model. The site clumped 13 different models, including outmoded ones, into one set of reviews making the reviews misleading and useless. It arrived in one day - door is no way reversible on THIS EXACT model. Luckily we don't care except I don't like being misled. This is not the first time I've discovered this practice - check out Amazon purchaser reviews of Panasonic NNT-945SF Microwave or Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cups. Reviews are grouped, ALL purchasers of Genius microwaves of any model, ALL flavors of Green Mountain. Useless! Last month we bought a Little Tykes coupe from Quidsi an amazon store, then discovered that the same thing with a trailer was available through Amazon directly. Went to cancel the first one WITHIN FOUR MINUTES and we couldn't because it had ""shipped"". We had to take order and return it which cost us $14 UPS. What a scam...  Other than constantly and increasingly dealing with questionable information, if you do research on several websites and don't rely on Amazon to make your decisions, then you know EXACTLY what you want, they are quite amazingly fine.",1

"I don’t know what has happened to Amazon in recent months but it’s seriously gone downhill. From an exemplary service to poor. 4/10 items either lost or damaged. A small business would fold with those stats.So no more Amazon for me, simply not good enough. 😢",0

"Amazon is definitely one of my favorite online shopping sites besides of course, ebay. However, I prefer amazon more. The reason being is, Amazon does not scam. I can give 100% trust in the service & the seller. Although sometimes, apparently, it does not carry what I wanted therefore I have to switch to ebay. But overall, I'd always pick Amazon because it has never failed me! :)",2
"Good prices for most of goodss you can find. Sometimes shipment is very fast but sometimes is delayed, and I like most Amazon support supports.",1
"Don’t ever use Amazon.es! Faulty items that Amazon does not want to take responsibility for even though it was Amazon that sold and delivered it. I bought some baby items well in time for the baby’s arrival. I had a quick look to see if everything was there and it looked fine but obviously didn’t put it up including a travel cot/changer as I wasn’t due any time at that point, I got it early just in case as you never know when the baby decides to come. When I did get to put it all up, there was a clip missing to hold the changer up safely onto the cot, this is something I would t know was missing without the whole thing up and reading instructions etc. I contacted Amazon and they shrugged it off saying the policy is complain within 30 days. This isn’t realistic for this sinario but they didn’t want to know. I only wanted the missing item! I didn’t want a refund or a return, I just wanted the clip which I am unable to buy separately. They didn’t care and didn’t want to know!! It’s so black and white with Amazon and will use anything to avoid responsibility and to compensate a faulty item! I might as well paid a lot less for the same item as I am unable to use the other aspects. It’s now just a travel cot. I paid €110 for a travel cot!!! Don’t bother! Go to a shop or use a different online sight!",0

Very good company I like everythink about the company support and service and delivery was really fast.,2
"WARNING:Just a word of warning.I've ordered lots of things from Amazon and only had 2 or 3 failures.  However, I feel that I should warn people that if your item is coming in from anywhere in the world, including Europe, customs randomly check items and if they are over just £18 in value, they levy a surcharge.  I've just been told that my item won't be released unless I pay £32.  The item itself was £52 and I paid £52 for delivery.  That means that costs have now exceeded the value of the goods.  Absolutely ridiculous.My options are to pay, or let the item be returned.  I have to add that I didn't buy this item off Amazon but when I told Parcelforce Coventry that I'd ordered high value items in the past with no problems, she said that I'd just been lucky not to have received a surcharge. Check where your items are coming from before you take the gamble.",2
Cheap price. So far not ordinary.,1
Good choice. But not excellent service,2

"I ordered off a supplier through Amazon, I ordered three of the items and later discovered Amazon charged me 3x the delivery fee. The product was ordered and would be delivered together!! I requested Amazon to refund 2 x the delivery fee and they refused and also decided to argue with me consistently back and fore on email until I got fed up of their confrontational attitude and gave up. I to date have never received the goods that I paid including delivery of £35.00. They decided to deliver early without warning I was at work so they decided to leave at a post office depot miles away from where I live. I am not going to collect the goods and made that clear to Amazon on email. So to date I do not have the goods and they still have my £35. I will never order from Amazon again. I have made that clear to them and they don't care as they are literally in the pound seat. Dispicable!!!!",2
Reason f o r one star is far from friendly an not good at solving issues orders are never on time I would not recommend this place to any one an they don't respond back to you an if they do it's not on time .,0
"Nice company,very caring and helpful staff",2
"The worse company to make shopping online, if you want avoid at bad situation not but in Amazon. They never have a time slot to deliver your order, the costumer service the only solution they give you is to wait, if you have to return an item it is a big problem to get your money back, in my case they told me that the order arrived in one day and it's been a week and they haven't delivered it to me I spoke with costumer service and they told me that I have to wait two more weeks and I can't cancel the order I have to wait three weeks to request a refund",0
Knowledgeable vendorsWell mannered well priced and amazing service professional.,2
I have ordered books and other gadgets from Amazon for almost two years.The goods are always fine with decent packaging.The shipment is not so fast the only thing that bothers me,1
I have been trying to get hold of amazon one phone number they give dosent exist I live in a block of flats and they are given the code to get in but the lazy driver opens the door and throws all the parcel just inside for anyone to take one of mine was left out in.the pouring rain i was lucky because my next door neighbour saw it and gave it to me before it got to wet at this time of year they should be more careful.where they throw parcels,1

Love shopping on this site.  Always a value.,2
"I'm really happy of the service I got from Amazon. Good package, good product, fast delivery.The best ecommerce website.",2
"I love Amazon. They have a nice selection of products. I broke a cell phone and had to replace the screen. I was able to order a replacement screen kit for under $10. Shipping time was a little longer than I would have hoped for, but I did receive my item.  I was also amazed with the list of resources, when I was researching the kit, it had a list of ""How To"" videos. I found that very helpful.",2

"So on July 27th, I got a message saying that someone had purchased some Nintendo gift cards and Apex Legends coins. I first contacted customer support on July 28th and then again August 1st and then again on August 6th and then again August 29th about some issues with someone gaining access to my account and spending $176.86 out of my $200 gift card. In the email that I received from Customer service on July 29th and again on August 6th, they said that they would restore my gift card balancewithin 2-3 days. I still have not received my money back. My account hasbeen locked since.",0
"Amazon prime continues to disappoint. 2 day shipment no longer exists and movies suck big time. Haven't ran across a movie I want to watch that's  ""free"" in ages. The decent titles have to be rented again on top of the price already paid for Amazon prime. Amazon prime itself is just a gimmick to make sure people use a prime seller to get free not so free shipment. We are stupid.",1

"No need to review the store... That's all fine. Even great. Huge goods range, relatively fast and cheap shipment options to New Zealand. What's not to like?Well, Amazon Prime video... The movies and TV shows they offer to NZ customers are better than Netflix NZ, but it is impossible to watch 'em. Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ. It's just impossible to use Amazon Prime in NZ. Cancelled the subscription. Back to the more-or-less-crappy alternatives, we have here.",1
"Placed an order, items being sent in 2 shipments both from Amazon delivery drivers. First shipment marked delivered to mailroom, no picture. Should’ve been to front door. I run down to see it’s not in there. See Amazon driver and he tells me he didn’t have a delivery for me. Call customer service and they say it was marked delivered by mistake and I’ll get it with 2nd shipment. 2nd shipment marked delivered but doesn’t say where and no picture. It’s not outside. I call Amazon and receive terrible customer service so fuming mad I drive down to the Amazon HUB customer counter. Spoke to 2 supervisors who looked into it and found that one shipment was delivered a mile away, completely different apartment complex. The other, they say they have no idea what the driver did but delivery wasn’t actually attempted. They could see this by looking up the GPS history. I now drive to the “wrong” address where they told me it was and spoke with leasing staff. My packages were not found but they did find several packages that belonged to people at MY complex, a mile away. I called Amazon customer service and explained all of this for the 10th time. Amazon then emails me a questionnaire to file a report for them to look into it, I gave them everything they asked for. They respond with, NO refund NO replacement, basically you’re SOL! So, I’ve spent hours of my time and not even to mention aggravation dealing with them over this. I had to file a dispute with my CC company. To add insult to injury I get a WARNING email from Amazon due to “too many” packages reported missing. They are threatening to close my account. Wow!!! They think they are so big and successful that they can now treat their customers like dirt. I’m deleting their app, deleting my handmade seller’s account, F them, horrible company!!!!",0
"This is the first time when I have such experience with you, I have an ordered on 11th dec the delivery date was on 19th dec although, without delivering the product got message of successful delivery so, called customer care and asked the reason not to deliver my product she replied it was just technical glitch due to which it happened and also assured to me will be delivered till 24th dec. It's 27th dec now but, didn't receive yet. Now, My order isn't showing under the section orders have all the payment details with me if I didn't get call then I am compelled to file a case in consumer court.",0
"Products are great, not a single problem with anything I’ve purchased from them. Delivery of merchandise, however, is very disappointing. They’re two day shipment sometimes turns into more than a week. They’re package tracker is just a plain outright lie. They really need to be more honest about there shipping practices, the ONLY thing the “prime” membership saves you is the $20.00 shipping cost. Some independent stores will get your merchandise to you in two days but I don’t think the Amazon store itself cares when you get your orders.",1
"Amazon Prime. It's fine when they have the item in stock and you are prepared to wait until the end of the day.Recent orders - My keyboard broke, so when asked if I wanted shipment morning I said yes please. Got a message late morning saying couldn't deliver, nobody at home. This is code for ""you live off my route, and I have too many parcels to deliver, so I will pretend you weren't in"". Liars. So instead I received it at the end of the following day.Next one - I ordered an item that said it would be delivered next day from their website. An hour later I get a message saying that the item would be delivered in 11 days time. So I cancelled the order, and my money will be returned in about a week and a half. Amazon must have known that they had no stock, their stock must be computerised for the robots to be able to fetch it off the shelves. SO liars again. When you are paying an extra £90 a year for next day shipment, this kind of behaviour sours the relationship.Next problem - you cannot complain by chat about an order you have cancelled. So I asked for a call and was called by a young woman the other side of the world, for whom English was guesswork. But then I don't speak Phillippino either. Waste of my time again.",1
good value and excellent service.  Can always rely on this company,2
"I been a customer for 10 years and they continue to do the right thing every time. Recently, I bought a heavy scooter for my son and he could not use it. They took it back without questions asked. Amazing service.",2
"Won't honour their own prices. I've been a big customer for years. Today I closed my membership. An item I bought, in sale, was £140 less hours later. I asked for a refund (before it was delivered) and was told that they don't price match. I did say, its only price matching with yourself.I needed the item urgently for work so couldn't return and reorder, which is weirdly what they said that I could do???? Just refund the difference. They wouldn't so I won't be a customer again. Weird policy. It meant that I don't feel like a valued business customer.",1
"Terrible customer service only option chat, says my order was delivered I was in all day nothing received. Told me to wait till Saturday I am away now till Tuesday.  I pay prime for a reason so what’s the point if they fail and lie about saying it has been delivered!!!  It then hung up on me even though I pressed the button to continue chat.",0
Review system skewed,0
This company product is very effective & it workes very nice,2
a terrible usage. a poorly designed website,1
First rate company. They aren't all about screwing customers out of money like light in the box. Customer service has live human beings and doesn't jack u around like light in the box.,2
"I use Amazon a lot. And for the most part it's fine. However just recently it's been a bit of a joke. A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the item itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items. Then I also pay for Amazon Prime, the idea being next day order. Ordered an item and didn't receive it next day. Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the order date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days. So I pay a premium for you to make me wait longer than expected and then not send the item and make me wait for a refund. No explanation either. It's really annoying. Makes me think twice about using them again and makes me wonder about Prime membership.",1
If I could give 0 stars I would. Waited in all day to be told at 16.00 delivery would not be coming.  Cancelled it and requested a refund. 2 weeks later still no refund so finally managed to speak to them.  They have now processed my refund so will be another week at least.  Avoid at all costs.,0
"Hello,I am from Dublin.Amazon, from a consumer point of view, are really good.There customer service is VERY good and have had many good experiences with what should be bad ones. Most recent, I bought an power supply and  it didn't work for all intended purposes.I got Karen, amazon associate. She was good/great!. Got it sorted and i got a refund. 5 minutes!!How they deal with mistakes or issues is really refreshing.They are customer centric. So yeh Thank you Karen :)",2
"Spent over $600.00 for items for a small business. They sent only a partial package. Someone at the warehouse read the order wrong. Made several phone calls to C/S only to be told they cant help and cannot send entire order or cannot give me a refund, or would just hang up on me only for  having to call back again and talk to someone else and  explain the partial order again.  They claim it was stolen upon delivery. The package was directly handed to me so it wasnt stolen. Amazon wanted me to file a police report?? Someone packing at the warehouse messed up. They want me to return the partial package, Im still waiting for their return label. Almost 2 weeks. I filed a dispute with my credit card company, still waiting for results of my dispute. My next move will be to news channels,  BBB, the State attorney generals office, and anyone else out there that can either get me the rest of my order or get me a refund, or else I will be out over $600's. Ive shopped at Amazon alot over the years, well, never again and although Amazon is a huge company and maybe $600 isnt alot of money to them but its alot for me to lose. Sad, that, for a company like Amazon that they will not help with customer issues, but sure didnt hesitate to take my money. So, from now on I will do my shopping elsewhere.",0
"Generally okay in my usage. My only real issue is the stupid ""Try now pay later"" Wardrobe system. They took money out of my account instantly and i was told it would be refunded within 5-10 days. What is the point in the system if i'm just going to be charged straight away? I'm not gonna use the system if i had the money to pay for it there and then, am i? If i wasn't to be refunded until the 10th day then i'm effectively paying for the goods twice until the refund is issued. The scheme, to me, just sounds like I'm giving Amazon a small loan. Bloody stupid.",1
It's simply simple it's easy and the help is there when you need it. I love this place and you should check it out.,2
"I CLEARLY SEE NOW WHY THERE IS A 1 STAR OVERALL RATING! I HAVE BEEN CHASING TWO RETURNS FOR AT LEAST OVER A MONTH! THE CARD I USED WAS COMPROMISED HOWEVER THE ACCOUNT REMAINED OPEN AND I GOT A NEW DEBIT CARD. AFTER AT LEAST 10 EMAILS BACK AND FORTH AND AMAZON ASKING 5 TIMES IF I WANT STORE CREDIT OR A CHECK I AGAIN SAID THE CHECK SINCE THEY CANNOT ISSUE THE REFUND TO THE SAME ACCOUNT/NEW CARD. THE CHECKS TAKE 6 TO 8 WEEKS YET 5 TIMES I'VE ADVISED THEM I WANTED THE CHECKS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW IF SOMEONE TOOK CASE MANAGEMENT SERIOUSLY AND I DIDNT HAVE TO TALK TO 15 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEN YESTERDAY 10/18 ALMOST TWO MONTHS LATER. THEY EMAIL ME SAYING THEY RFUNDED A MASTERCARD EXPIRING IN 2024. IF YOU COULDNT REFUND THE NEW DEBIT CARD I ADVISED YOU OF THAT IS NOW CONNECTED TO THE SAME ACCOUNT AS THE OLD CARD, HOW DID YOU RANDOMLY SELECT A MASTERCARD (DIDNT EVEN TELL ME THE CARD NUMBER) THAT IS ON MY ACCOUNT TO REFUND! AT THIS POINT I NEED TO GET LEGAL INVOLVED FOR A REFUND LESS THAN 100 DOLLARS. AND MENTAL SUFFERING AS THIS IS CAUSING SO MUCH ANXIETY FOR ME!",0
Really happy with items purchased. Thank you.,2
Good but dident knock anyone could’ve stole parcel,2
"Once upon a time, in the magical land of Amazon.com, I embarked on a quest to buy a variety of items and even sell some of my own. Little did I know that this journey would be filled with both laughter and bewilderment.As a buyer, my interaction has been mostly positive. Amazon's vast selection of goodss and speedy order make it a convenient choice for all your shopping needs. However, there have been times when I've encountered the occasional weirdness with returns. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and hopping on one foot.But fear not, dear reader, for I have discovered a hidden treasure! On rare occasions, I've managed to summon a human customer support representative. These elusive creatures are surprisingly pleasant and possess the power to make your problems disappear with a wave of their magical wand.Now, let's talk about the dark side of Amazon: the seller interaction. As a small business owner, I must warn you that Amazon is a greedy and ridiculous platform. It's like a dragon hoarding all the gold and leaving you with just a few measly coins. Their policies are designed to maximize their own profits, leaving sellers feeling like they're on a never-ending quest for fairness.To all aspiring merchants out there, I would advise you to tread carefully in the treacherous realm of Amazon. Offer your goodss on their platform to reach a wider audience, but don't put all your eggs in this basket. Instead, create your own enchanted website and offer your wares at a slightly lower price. It's like offering a secret discount to those who dare to venture beyond the Amazon kingdom.In conclusion, dear reader, Amazon.com is a land of contrasts. As a consumer, you'll likely have a acceptable interaction, but as a seller, be prepared for a wild and unpredictable journey. So, gather your courage, sharpen your wit, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",1
"ok support, pretty fine prices for most of the things you can find.Sometimes shipment is super fast and sometimes it is delayed, you never know what's coming.But in most cases, the top wait is a week.",1
Review text not found,2
Amazon prime is just becoming a joke. They make you wait home all day and continuously tell you it will be delivered by 10pm and then all of a sudden it’s got an unexpected delay and will be with you in a few days. It’s not the service you pay for and the customer service reps just say don’t worry you will get it in a few days. It’s not exactly the service I’m paying for when it’s meant to be next day or the day I’m choosing. More than 50% of my deliveries run into unexpected delays. They just make too much profit to care about losing customers nowadays.,0
"Great and easy to navigate, with amazing ship times!",2
Easy to find stuff to order. Usually quick shipping. If you have a return it has been easy to get my money back.,2
"I have ordered two goodss in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.  Now I am wondering if I can trust them to get a package delivered for Christmas, even with “guaranteed “ order dates.",1
"My package said delivered but it was nowhere to be found. This has happened before, which is extremely frustrating as I had left detailed instructions on where to leave the package. They were helpful in refunding me which was very kind, however, I think they need to have better communication with their shipping entities.",1
"They lost my package, then found it.. then lost it and then i was double charged. It was refunded in the end but It was a right faff on.",1
"Skip the middle man.  Going through Amazon makes it very confusing when one needs to make a return or exchange.  However, Amazon has rectified any problems, but it's hard to know if one is communicating with Amazon or the original seller.",1
"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great interaction with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer support rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer support, is that if you ask a question about a item because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer support reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
"Customer support could be way better, managed to have my refund for a item but it took a while because the support was not able to provide it with enough proof, everything else was okay but that should be something to work on. (This was something related to Amazon Prime)",1
"Never had an issue with this company, always deliver on time - usually early. I'd use them more if they didn't go out of their way to avoid taxes. But really there's no-one to touch them for value & service.",2
"Once upon a time Amazon was a great company.  Those days are long gone.  Greed has transformed this company and not for the better.  If you have any sort of issue with an order, you will get someone in a third world country with a script and a lack of basic comprehension skills.  That's their idea of ""support"". I tried to return something and only had the option of having UPS pick it up.  Waited all day for UPS and they never came.  I contacted Amazon yet again.... explained that UPS never showed up and my preference was to drop it off at UPS store.  I was told by the customer service idiot that I could simply drop it off to the UPS store.  WRONG.  I drove to the UPS store and was told that they could not accept my package because I had the wrong barcode and the one I gave them was for UPS pickup.   I stepped outside, contacted Amazon, got another moron w/ a script in a third world call center who couldn't help me.  I was told that they could not provide a QR code and I needed to find a printer.   So I had to drive home from the UPS store to print the barcode.  Now I get to find the time to drive yet again to the UPS store to drop the return off.How is this convenient and why should I keep paying for Prime?  Seems like Prime keeps going up and service keeps getting worse.Done with Amazon.",0

"Nothing but a 5 star for me. Crazy to read all the negative reviews. I've been ordering from Amazon for years they've been extremely transparent with everything, lost or misplaced items no issue getting a reimbursement. All the benefits that come with prime is well worth the fee alone. Delivery, costumer service and product all 5 star and the reason why I will continue to use Amazon (Amazon Prime)",2
"Excellent is not what I would share about any company. But Amazon has been exceptional in so many regards as to shipping on time, the amount of choices, desired product lines. Amazon could improve on their Prime in MY opinion. Give a bit more leeway in the choice of movies presented. I mean, there are so many films that should be on Amazon Prime that are not. Any movies over Ten Years Old should be free in MY opinion. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal here? So many great flicks from awhile ago and still you want to be paid for them. You are already receiving 100 dollars a year for Prime. And I might add, you are a HUGE company with substantial profit.",2

For some reason at this present moment Amazon are claiming my account has been disabled AFTER setting up 2Factor Authentication - pathetic company outside of their day to day running they have no focus on customer service.Don't take my word for it, contact Amazon Support and be greeted by one of various thick accents that Amazon pay $5 Per Hour to sit in their rooms, stoned and answer calls.",0

"Amazon... One of the biggest companies out there... You all seriously don't have an option to upload credit card information manually every time you purchase? I'm forced to upload my card and have it saved there until removed? What if my kids get into my account and decides to buy everything as far as the eye can see? I wouldn't be able to stop it considering my card information is saved and all they have to do is click ""continue""... I just purchased a laptop and apparently I still had my old card uploaded there from a purchase I did years ago WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. Thank God It was a Credit card and according to Tamara I was able to change the payment method to my new card before Amazon charged my old card. Or else there would of been a big problem.

"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping assistance. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few average and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman assistance suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1
"I am a Amazon prime  member and been a loyal customer for years,but after todays expeirence I have had enough,my delivery was due at five past twelve pm following the tracking on the Amazon app they kept putting the delivery time back all the time I and still waiting at seven o'clock at night,just sat in all day when I could have been doing other things,this is how they treat there customer's,",0

"This is what online shopping should be, this is by far the best experience I've had with online ordering, I have been using eBay as long as I can remember but when they started letting people sell fake/knock off items I had to cut down a bit, but even the $13 a month for Amazon Prime is honestly not bad at all, it just ensures that you will get the majority of your items in 2 days, which is Awesome no matter who you are, and it also allows me to watch shows and movies that I do not own all for the Prime fee, I swear idk if I can shop anywhere else after my recent great experiences shopping with them, I see why they're taking over, I only wish I had jumped on earlier, Definitely Recommend !!",2
"I have ordered for years, I have never had a problem until the past year. Orders don’t arrive when they are supposed to! I was paying for prime but stopped, because I never got them on time, and I would put my payment on to be taken out. You never took it out until days later, I do t keep my credit card on there because I had purchases on my card I didn’t order and had to call my credit card company. Very disappointed in the way you treat your customers. I know a lot of people that have stopped using amazon for the same reasons I have had with you. The whole year it won’t let you pick that !",0
"Today being stalked by Amazon. Sending me MENS VANS SKATEBOARDING SHOES ONTO MY PHONE. I am sick to death of Amazon stalking me on my phone 😭😭😭😭😭 I continue having complications with both talking to any English speaking CSR and getting rudely spoken to by foreign people overseas who clearly Do Not Care:( That I am a Prime Member means nothing to Amazon. I have been trying to buy a dog stroller on a payment plan. They approve the payment plan and then proceed to charge my Card for the over $320.00 full price of the dog stroller. The payment plan is to pay for this item month to month. Not all at once. I have bought 2 other items using their month to month plan with no problems. Yet the minute I try to buy this very important item they charge the full price even though I checked Month to month and the agreement shows I will only be charged a fraction of the full price. Zero help from Amazon about this. I contacted Petique the dog stroller makers and all they said was 'Sorry about Amazon,"" So Zero help. Many of my packages get stolen or delivered to completely different cities and I get cruel emails telling me my order has been delivered to me-when in fact it has not. I feel like there is a criminal element to my account because people email me telling me I need to change me mailing delivery instructions just seconds after I place my Amazon order. Also telling me to ""Update your Billing Address"". I have called and emailed Amazon about all of these issues and its always the same 2 voices of 2 men; they are very rude, sarcastic and sounds like a former landlord who did very bad things to me. It has gotten scary ordering anything from Amazon anymore. Amazon also continues sending me Suggestions to buy: MENs Watches. MENs Clothing. MENs Shoes. ALL MENs items. I am a Disabled Woman with Cancer. I have NEVER bought ANY Mens items and have asked them to stop sending me MENs suggestions. It is very disturbing the way they treat me; so badly! I can't believe I am paying them and they still do all these terrible things to me.",0

"I ordered 4 items (ships from amazon). First day, no doorbell, but package was there (Okay). second day, 2 items said out for delivery. web site said 1 delivered (I ran), delivery Guy still in truck. I yelled ""Where's the second one?"" He said ""The envelop?, that's not here.. maybe tomorrow"". I check the website. It says ""This package is delayed due to severe weather in the delivery network."" Well, if it's so severe..how did the big box get to me, santa?. Yesterday it shows up outside (no notice). Today it still says delayed due to weather. I think the Guy had it on the truck all along. Today, (it's 10:00 am) I have a package that says I'll get by 10:00 pm, but it hasn't even shipped yet, we'll see.",0

"Amazon prime temporarily locked my account out of the blue for no reason. And it keeps telling me to contact the support team, only problem is, when I try contacting the support team, it tells me to log in WITCH I CAN NOT DO!!! So I am completely stuck, and because they have no other way of reaching out to them, then call (which I will not do from Denmark). Sooooo I guess I have to tell my bank to block any payments to amazon prime. Edit: I ended up creating another acount with another email, and got through to live chat. The promised to resolve the issue within 48 hours, so lets wait and see if thet actually does help",0
"Amazons delivery has been unreliable. They promise fast delivery with Prime, which is expensive and then don’t deliver on time. I’m finding Target and Walmart shipping much faster w/o membership cost.",0
"Love everything Amazon, sure there has been the odd hiccup here and there with an item but deliveries are fast and always when they should be. Generally speaking anything ordered for Prime delivery is of good quality and rarely have an issue with a prime item. Amazon have really seen the niche in the market to get stuff to customers when they need it and the range over all is massive.",2
"Amazon is the Best!  I have never had it so easy with Amazon. My experience is that they are always available to work out complaints with its customers. They are very knowledgeable and have great customer service. For instance, my complaint was with the seller. The seller would not satisfy its promise, so Amazon stepped in and fix the problem for me. Now the seller must answer to Amazon and i'm sure Amazon will put them on notice for failure to meet the customer needs. I will always be a Amazon Prime Member.",2
"It seems as though you can’t be honest with Amazon anymore. Recently I made a purchase for a phone. I couldn’t find the phone after delivery. I made a claim and they denied it. How can you just leave an expensive phone lying around out side, smh. I was about to resubmit when the package showed up. There  are still good people around living at the Apartment complex.The package also said charger included. There wasn’t a charger, very misleading information for $1065+. I sent a review and Amazon said it couldn’t be submitted. Because my focus was on seller and packaging. Are they for real?",0

"As a whole I have had a acceptable usage with Amazon, but that changed today when I called and Mezagreg (?) answered. I will take responsibility for halfway listening (working) to his question and answering him, but there is no excuse for chastising a customer for the way they talk. I  showed frustration for a situation that I'm dealing with and having an Amazon representative try to control me and the way I talk is crossing the line. He even laughed with amusement telling me to be professional (the customer). Then he hung up on me.  The next representative told me what he wrote explaining the call which was not the truth. I am sick of customer support representatives abusing the customers because they know they can hangup on us with the support of the company. How can a customer get help or ask a question if the people answering the phone has it out for us even before they answer. No care for the customer anymore.",1

Refund not returned within 7 days as promised. Live chat unwilling to help. Extended it to 14 business days and asked me to call back,0
"I haven’t had a terrible interaction but I also haven’t ever had a great interaction with Amazon.

Those are hit or miss, some are reliable and some are not.",1
fast shipping at great price for my order. Thanks!,2
"My order has gone missing. Order worth £150. I checked with my house mates- nobody signed for it or received anything. After contacting Amazon customer service, they told me to give them 48 to look into the matter. After checking with them again, they have asked me to get a police report because they can’t send a replacement! I sure won’t be shopping with Amazon again and will not recommend to anyone!",0

"I have just recently started shopping online in Amazon. They are able to ship the deliveries on time when I purchase the items. But when I try to return a item that I incorrectly purchased, it still said pending item returned for a drop bar handle bike via Canada Post, it has been since June 24th that I have been waiting for the refund. According to the Canada Post site and tracking system, it said that it was returned and shipped to the Amazon warehouse, but on the Amazon tracking status it still says it is waiting for the item to be returned to it.

I gave 4 stars because the majority of drivers are kind and helpful deserving  5 stars but 2% let the the other drivers and the company down when it  comes to the elderly we seem to speak another language they don’t understand us when one off these drivers came yesterday afternoon with order number 204-5796960-3400326 he rang the door entry bell I said bring it up please the address is first floor flat and he translates into leave it downstairs he even had a invisible receptionist sign for it because I certainly didn’t ,2
"I'm thrilled with my recent Amazon clothing purchase! I ordered the CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.The fit is absolutely perfect, and I appreciate the accurate sizing chart provided by the seller. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and of high quality, making it a pleasure to wear all day. Plus, it's even better in person than in the pictures - the color is vibrant and hasn't faded after multiple washes.What truly impressed me was the attention to detail in the design. The stitching is impeccable, and I haven't encountered any loose threads or issues with the seams. This piece not only looks fantastic but feels well-made.The delivery was prompt, and the packaging was eco-friendly, which I appreciate.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts is now a staple in my wardrobe, and I've received numerous compliments whenever I wear it. I'll definitely be exploring more clothing options from this brand in the future. Highly recommend![Hafsat Abdulkadir]",2
I am literally on the phone every week with Amazon customer service because one thing or another didn't get delivered or it was delivered to the wrong place or it's being held at US post office service. Whenever I call weekly by the way I get the most ignorant clearly non-educated people answering the call who don't know how to do anything but say oh I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I swear to goodness if one more Amazon person says I'm sorry to me I am going to lose my cool! I ordered pillows in June they never arrived they sent me new pillows which said were delivered but when you looked at the tracking the carrier just picked them up and that was the end of the tracking. So of course I had to do all the work I have to cancel the order I have to reorder them at a more expensive price because it's now been 2 months in the price is gone up I swear to God I am so flipping sick of Amazon and they're terrible policies and the fact that they really don't give a crap about whether you get your stuff or not. The policies they have in place are just ridiculous people are stealing my stuff so I have to cancel my order and reorder it again and they're stealing my stuff by not delivering it to me so it's not like somebody stealing it off my mailbox no it's never getting delivered half the time honestly I would not join Amazon and I think I'm going to cancel my whole thing because I'm sick of it I'd rather go to stores and wait at least then I get what I want and I don't have people lying to me I cannot stand when people lie and I think that's how they train their customer service just lie to them just lie to them it'll be fine go ahead and lie and say you're sorry eventually they'll be worn down and they'll do whatever you want. You know it would be different if they actually needed individual customers I feel like but they don't so they don't give a crap,0
I purchased many goods from amazon.it. And I was always super happy with the quality of service and scheduling of Amazon.,2
The owners wife should have taken more than the money she should have got this entire website taken down. Customer service hahaha what a joke all they know is how to say a script and even that is hard for them. They lost nothing clearly about third party returns and policies. I used to love amazon but as the time goes by this company is just another crap one we have dealt with before.,0
"Amazon's onboarding process as a potential seller is horrible! For a couple months I have been trying to list items. Amazon has sent me emails numerous times that my account is verified and I am ready to list.However, when I try to list (via adding a product not sold on Amazon) I get this, ""Problem with your Seller AccountYou’re currently unable to add or edit listings because either the credit card on file is invalid or the credit card is in the process of validating, which could take up to 24 hours. Please ensure that you have a valid credit card uploaded in Account Settings.""I have quadruple checked my credit card info matches my legal identity. That everything matches up 100%. Not only that I use this card on a daily basis. I also use it with my Amazon prime account (under the same account) often! But, am considering dropping my prime account based on this experience.I keep getting canned responses that don't help and have requested phone calls more than once and not received one.Absolutely horrible!",0
Never had a problem with amazon after many years of using them.,2
This company does not consider the customer. They sent me an item on a phone that I did not buy. I returned it and instead of issuing the refund to my credit card they credited it to a Gift Card without my consent to force me to spend the 270.00 dollars on their page .Get out of this company. Walmart already has one-day shipping service.When I spend the gift card money I close the account and the credit card. No more Amazon.,0
"Had a transaction for over £500 made on my account, only way I found it was that there was an address in the USA on my delivery addresses. They'd archived the order.At no point in the thieving little c*nts purchases did Amazon have any system that might have queried why £500 worth of stuff was going to the USA under a different name (internet security 101)Tried contacting them and the customer services are completely useless. Talk about the Spanish inquisition! No I don't know some random yahoo in America! They've made a serious balls up and will have to investigate before I get my money back.Hold your hands up and admit your security systems are crap and refund me immediately. If the shoe was on the other foot it would be slightly different. Take criminal activity going on in your business seriously!",0
All companies could learn from Amazon. Very good service and amazing at making things right. ,2
The customer service is appalling refuse to help and when you want to put forward about a complaint they refuse and don’t give any emails or numbers to put a complaint in its disgusting the way they treat customers one of the worst experiences I have had,0
excellent company. i have bought so many stuff since last year and they all have arrived on time and in great condition.,2
Worst customer service experience I've ever had. They charged me double for an Audible subscription but cannot see those charges in my account . They referred me 10 times back and fourth between different internal customer service numbers without success. Spent 3 hours of my life calling because of a failure of the company to establish efficient and customer friendly internal systems and lines of communication. It is noticeable that you're dealing with a gigantic company only in existance because they minimize costs and exploit their employees as well as their customers.,0
I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
My go to site for most things.  Love the Prime feature and the fast delivery.,2
Never had any problems with amazon. Use them a lot. Love the click and buy!,2
I used to buy most everything with ebay but now most purchases are with amazon. The prime program is unbeatable.,2
"Amazon customer service is Appalling!  I needed to return two damaged items and went through the returns process online.  The courier arrived on 3 occasions to collect them.  Each time with a car when, as items are heavy and bulky, a van is needed.  After each failed attempt I have contacted customer service by live chat and telephone.  Further collections were supposedly arranged with Hermes who didn’t turn up even after I waited in on days for them.  At this point I had contacted them at least 8 times.  The whole experience was utterly frustrating.  On 2 occasions the call was disconnected.  Eventually Amazon customer service told me I have to arrange my own courier and they will refund.  However, I tried again and, after explaining all the details again, this assistant said she went through to the large items department and had arranged the collection for the following Tuesday.  Again a courier didn’t turn up.  I tried to contact Hermes direct.  They only provide digital chat.  I inputted the parcels tracking number and waited about a week for a digital response which said they couldn’t locate the parcel.  I then went online to arrange my own courier.  The cheapest courier costs £126 yet the item cost £90.  I contacted Amazon again to check they would refund this large amount.  He said yes.  But as so many CS advisers have told me different things I don’t trust anything they say.  I am now left with two large and heavy items unlike want or can afford to fork out £126 for their return.  It definitely is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced and I will not buy anything through them again.",0
"*DO NOT TRUST AMAZON*Everyone who has EVER purchased anything on Amazon check all of your bank statements very closely. Look for Prime that you have never subscribed to also for Amazon Music. When you place an order with a third party seller, they (Amazon) have a habit of ""accidentally"" signing you up to one of these subscription services and charging to ANY CARD that has been used to buy a product. Even if it is not in the name of the person who holds the Amazon account.Example! My 70 year old mother was being billed for Amazon music, she did not even know about this. It went on for months. Finally yesterday I got to the cause of it and Amazon has agreed to refund ALL 8 wrongfully claimed payments from a pensioner. That amounted to almost £80 STOLEN from a vulnerable person.They also agreed to refund the £9.99 STOLEN from my card. It only came to my attention when I used my mothers Amazon to order an item from a third party seller. When I checked my card. I had been charged £9.99 for Amazon music, as my mother's registered card was lost and had to be cancelled and replaced. So Amazon took the money without authorisation from my account. Just to add. I have now been charged £1 by amazon only a day after this scamming, thieving, fraudulent bunch of vultures ""apologised"" for stealing money. I therefore deleted both my card and my mother's card from amazon. I suggest EVERYONE does the same. If you buy anything on Amazon, DO NOT STORE YOUR CARD!!! Simply input it for each transaction. Your money is NOT SAFE!! Better than that NEVER USE AMAZON. We never will again!!Had this not happened, and I had not been charged my mother would never have known about this and Amazon would have continued pocketing her money. Along with their tax avoidance schemes. So be warned. This company openly admitted to me that the system sometimes ""accidentally"" subscribes when a purchase is made. The person who scripted Amazon's website must be a total amateur if this is what happens. So everyone get checking you statements, if you see one payment to AMAZON MUSIC or AMAZON PRIME, that you have not asked for, go to your bank (or call them) Order statements dating back to when you first started using Amazon. You may find more unauthorised charges. Also if you have elderly parents who use amazon help them check their account. Amazon do not pay tax correctly, why should they also get away with STEALING from vulnerable people.My mother's was almost £80, your refund could be more, It depends how long it has been ongoing. But every penny they have taken without permission will be refunded. And Amazon if you're reading this. ALL CARDS have now been removed from your scummy site and not one more order will be placed using Amazon. Sorry this is a long post but it needed explaining in case amazon are stealing from others. They certainly won't check their end, as long as they get their money coming in. So ensure you all check.I would love to have replies on here of anyone who checks their account and finds they have been unknowingly charged. I know for a fact amazon do it frequently, my bank told me this and even said they refund people OFTEN. So there is a good chance of you being owed and I would love to hear about your situation.Thanks for reading.",0
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new shipment system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a shipment but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" shipment. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1

"I have been an Amazon Prime member for many years. They were great, fast, efficient, and good customer service. However, several months ago I placed an order for an item that was on backorder for three weeks. No big deal. But when the three weeks past, I got an email saying the item would not be available for unknown amount of time. Just for kicks, I looked my item up on Amazon. It should to be in-stock but the process had tripled. Yes, tripled. I contacted customer service and asked how an item could be in-stock and yet my back-ordered order had not been filled. They could not give me an explanation and told me that if I ordered the same item at the new price, when it arrived, they would refund me the difference. When the new order arrived, I contacted them again for my refund and they refused to give it to me. After days of going back and forth with customer service, I finally wrote a letter to the corporate office with print-outs of all the chat messages with customer service. I sent the letter certified with signature delivery confirmation. I got the signature card back a week later and expected.Well, I just got the letter back... opened and taped back shut saying ""Return to sender - wrong address."" So I'm done with Amazon.",0

"Seriously thinking about canceling my Amazon Prime Membership.I will never buy anything of value on Amazon again after Amazon’s latest screw up.I had saved up for close a year for a new IPad.My present one is cracked and hardly works.I ordered the new iPad through my Prime Membership. At 1st, Amazon claimed that it would arrive the very next day.That changed to two days, which I was fine with. I paid a friend to hang out and get the iPad from the Amazon driver. I did this because this was an expensive item and I didn’t want anything to happen to it. The tracking information said the iPad would arrive between 11:45am and 2:45 pm. Only 6 stops away. Later, I saw that the iPad had been delivered!Great, I thought!I got home around 5:30pm and asked my friend where’s the iPad?He told me that No Amazon Track or Driver dropped off anything at the front door?What, I exclaimed!I immediately tried to contact Amazon Customer Service, which is a total nightmare and not much help, other than asking if I had checked my front porch?No, it’s not on the front porch!Customerservice told me that the iPad was delivered because it says so?OMG, what’s wrong with these people.Usually Amazon takes a photo of where the driver left the item.In my case, there was No Photo!So, an hour later I was speaking with an Amazon supervisor.I explained everything for the 20th time.Only to be told, please wait another day?I asked if I could get another tracking number for a time of arrival? No Can Do!If the iPad hasn’t arrived by the end of the 3rd day, please call back and file a claim.Well that day came and went, No IPad.I’m presently taking Amazon to Small Claims Court to get my money back.So, the moral of the story is,Think Twice Before You Order Anything Of Value From Amazon!Because if anything goes wrong, You Are On Your Own!Amazon=Buyer Beware!",0

One of the greatest online shopping site I've ever used.  I won't stop using amazon until I die.,2

"It used to be that if I purchase more than $35, it usually was Free Shipping.  Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1
"There is always something wrong with Amazon.Starting from out of date food shipment, subscriptions with rising prices with every shipment.Ending on a useless document verification system, which is unable to verify documents accepted by ANY OTHER BRITISH company.That's why I quit my Prime membership after 6 years.",1
fast shipping at great price for my order. Thanks!,2
You get exactly what it says on the screen,2
Amazon is a great site to get premium products at a affordable price.Their products always come well packed and are on time.,2

"I have purchased a washing machine from Amazon and really wish I didn’t. Not only was I not offered the chance to have installation included, nor collection of existing machine, now they have messed me around with the delivery. I booked someone else to install it and now have had to cancel them messing them about too. I now have no idea when the machine will turn up so can’t book the installers again. Been a week without any washing machine and the whole process has been utterly useless. Tried phoning their customer care people and got nowhere. Will never use this company again for purchases like this as other companies provide a far better and more comprehensive service. Amateurs!",0
Terrible customer service run by human robots. You can't really discuss any issue.They treat their customers with outmost disrespect.I predit that amazon will not be what it is now in a few years.,0
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve items with so-so quality,1
"Easy to navigate, perfect user experience design, perfect behavioral targeting etc",2
exelent applications,2
"They are safe and efficient Perhaps I have been fortunate but I have never had anything but decent support from Amazon,their drivers have invariably been courteous and helpful.",1

Item couldn’t be collected because the local locker was stuck solid. Amazon immediately sent me a replacement plus a voucher in respect of all the hassle. When the locker was later opened Amazon let me keep that item too. Every business makes mistakes sometimes and I judge them by how well and how quickly they make amends. Excellent service.,2
"Amazon has certain pluses about it, but like many large companies they tend to overlook customer support. I waited 1 1/2 weeks for a replacement item before I called them only to find out they forgot to send it. Really? How does this even happen?",1
"BOYCOTT AMAZONI have used Amazon for twenty years or more, and buy hundreds of items from them every year. Last week I had an insolent message from a so-called Account Specialist who claimed: ""We noticed that you have requested multiple returns in the last few months, and some of the items that you have returned were damaged, used, or not in their original condition."" That was a pack of lies. I wrote back, pointing out that I have never returned anything unless there was something wrong with it, and that nothing had ever been damaged or been used. This waste-of-space (who has never signed his name) then copied his first message without answering my email. I then complained first to the Manager, then to HIS boss, and I sent copies to Jeff Bezos which always did the trick. The waste-of-space pulled the same stunt four times - never replied, and simply copied his first message again and again. I have now demanded that my complaint be escalated and until it is resolved, I will not buy anything through these misfits.",0
"I really like to find everything I need in one place, apart from the offers I receive, the delivery service is one of the best on the market, so far I have no complaints about quality or response times, I am very happy, go to giant stores without leaving my house, that's what I call innovation ..",2
Always amazing Customer service. Cannot fault them.,2
"I’ve never really had any issues with Amazon, if I have it’s only ever been really miner and has always been resolved promptly, I find Amazon has excellent costumer service. Any items I order are often delivered the following day (with prime membership). There’re  such a wide selection of items on offer, if I want something, they usually have it. Their gift wrapping service is great too, if I forget somebody’s birthday I can order something off amazon have it gift wrapped and delivered the following day to their door, sometimes even the same day. Personally I can’t fault Amazon.",2
I received my package with a delay of 2 days but it arrived safe covered by a fine packaging!,1
"I recently bought a school text book, art equipment and a reading book. I pay for amazon prime and as always my package arrived the very next day, which was very useful because I needed the art supplies and textbook for school the next day. it was delivered early in the day so I did not have to wait inside for the whole day. my items were all in the same cardboard package which is good because it is saving paper so good for then environment. overall I was very pleased with this delivery and I will be spreading the word of my positive experience.",2
I just spent an hour with Amazon customer service to correct a billing problem they created. I still dont know why it happened and the customer service rep could barely speak english. It is silly that they dont have people that can speak english and cant answer your questions and would not transfer me to a supervisor.UN acceptable,0
I continue to be amazed at the quick service! Placed an order an hour ago and all items will be delivered today. Blows my mind every time.,2
amazon is great but what get me mad is that IF YOU AIN'T IN THERE PROGRAM . you can't write no reviews or they band you from writing reviews. I am honest person and I show video/pictures of the goodss and still got band.,1
"For the past few days a promotion had been popping up on my account, ""Save $15 with your first sign in on the app"". I have a Prime membership and consistently place orders on Amazon but through my regular browser so I proceeded to download the app. After downloading the app I add an item to the cart that meets their requirement of $30. However, the $15 are not automatically deducted off the total. So I decide to reach out to customer service through the available chat option only to be given the runaround.My first complain is that I switch off from a representative to representative. If you do not respond back within a minute or god forbid 2. You will have a new representative that will need to read the complete conversation to catch up.Then a representative decided to focus on whether I received an email with the promotion? In which I respond, it doesn't seem to me that I need one when the promotion clearly states, ""the eligible customers should have received this offer directly from Amazon through the Amazon website OR by email. My favorite was when a representative told me I was not eligible because unbeknownst to me. I downloaded the app already in March 2018. Yet, I have several emails from Amazon throughout the summer with a similar promotion asking me to download the app.I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from Amazon. I had a more serious matter  resolved with Best Buy resolved through chat in less than 8 minutes. While, I had close to a 4 hour conversation through chat with more than a handful of Amazon representative only for my time to be wasted. A representative finally informed me a complaint will be placed after over 3 hours of me speaking with representatives and that I would hear back in 48 hours. 4 hours later over six representatives later, my matter was never resolved. My household spends thousands every year through Amazon. Just for them to not be able to honor a $15 promotion they themselves promoted to me on my account. I hardly ever use promo codes when shopping on Amazon but if they will be promoting a discount for downloads of their app they should honor it. Amazon will surely be losing much business from our end and I will be doing my research in other websites now instead of immediately going through Amazon.",0

Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.,1
"I won't go into all the awful details, because it's frankly not worth more of my time. The broad strokes are someone hacked our account we've had for nearly 20 years, changed the email & phone # associated with the account, turned on 2 factor authentication, & ordered 4 (yes, FOUR) robotic vacuum cleaners totaling $1700. My husband spent over 20 hours in one week on the phone with Amazon trying to get them to let us back into our account, give us our money back, cancel the order, etc. Supposedly they were having their IT dept go thru code line-by-line because they were baffled as to how someone was able to hack our account. Never got any answers on that account. The phone number & email address associated with our account had only been changed once in nearly 20 years (by us) - that didn't raise any red flags?? We've never bought one let alone FOUR robotic vacuums... THAT didn't raise any red flags?? They eventually gave us our money back, but our account remained locked, even to us. We routinely spent over $10,000 per year with them, more when COVID hit. They could not have cared less about retaining us as customers. No compensation for massive amounts of our time wasted due to their lousy security. No explanation. No follow-thru. I'd give them zero stars if I could. Now we only buy thru them when we absolutely have to have something & we absolutely cannot find it anywhere else, which amounts to next to nothing. Forget this place. They are the absolute worst.",0
no problems here,1
"Bought a selection of items for family back home, all set to deliver to the UK (was sure i did this through Amazon.co.uk)Find out that somewhere along the way they randomly charged me 92.50 for Amazon Prime. Once i spent 30 mins and a couple of transfers on the phone, i got it refunded, but its just as well i checked my pending transactions online otherwise I might never have know they'd charged me, for a Prime account i dont have too. Fast resolve but shouldnt happen in the first place with this much money.",1
"My order was delayed in delivery and when I finally recieve mail with hours of deliveri, I site all that time at entrance of my home. There was no my package or any signs of delivery service, but at 15:58 status was changed to ""delivered"". I ask custom service about investigation and was very surptized: they ask me to go to local police and report of stilling. This is how amazon trying not only to shift it's responcibility to me, but also because of very unprofessional service make big troubles to it's customers: if I was sitting all time at door, and see that package was not delivered and noone still it, it mean that I will make false statement and will have big troubles. THIS IS HOW AMAZON SERVICE UNPROFESSIONAL. And I was just asking to proof of delivery and investigation.",0
"Terrible customer service from Amazon. I bought a Nadalan Freesat box on Amazon.  It will only pick up a few channels and not  most of the major channels.  I have a different make of Freesat box working in a different room but from the same dish and that works fine so I know the Nadalan box is the issue.  As the item did not work and is functionally virtually useless, I sought to return it.  Every time I attempt to print a return label via the Amazon website, I get an error message and that they were attempting to sort this out.  I called Amazon and they said they would sort this out.  5 days later and the issue persists.  I was told they would e-mail a return label and Amazon have failed to do so.  I received an e-mail saying they would phone back the following day and they did not do so. I can only conclude that they have lost interest and by adopting such a poor and unhelpful stance they hope they will not have to deal with the issue.",0

"I was shocked! You aren’t able to write a negative review on purchases.  I had trouble with a purchase and titled my review...”buy at your own risk”.  I said that “I ordered an item the 1st part of July and after 3 weeks I contacted the seller to say it hadn’t been received and was told it was shipped, but never got any other communication  from the seller after that.”  Amazon said I couldn’t post a review like that.  I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.",1
"2024 has been one unpredictable shipment after another. When purchasing, you are given choices as to shipment dates. Purchase may be averaged between dates. However, when promised same day or next day, the on going accuracy has been off by a couple days and the tracker is slow to update until items are within minutes of house. It's hot and I'm old, so grabbing before ruined is sometimes a factor and scheduling when I'll be there to take it inside.",1
"My usage with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the shipment company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
"Amazon.is my most favorite place to shop ever, they always meet or beat the cheapest price for an item,I know I order everyday. I.know there's been some controversy over reviews but I want to set the record straight. There are many people that provide legitimate, honest reviews on products, they aren't paid, swayed or compensated in any way. I don't know how it came to be if you review a lot of stuff, your writing ""fake"" reviews. I buy almost everything from Amazon so I write tons of reviews and I can honestly say I've never written a untruthful review in my life, ever. I can't say that everyone in the world writes honest reviews but what I can say is don't disregard a review if the person reviews a lot of items. I enjoy sharing my thoughts on products because I always read reviews, I hope in paying it forward.Amazon also has exceptional customer service, it didn't start out this way they had terrible, hard to understand reps who didn't provide a solution to your issue and didn't care. This is all changed, they respond quickly, efficiently and provide an immediate solution, it's truly one of the best companies in terms of service out there.I wish they would stay away from buying grocery stores and expanding, people don't realize if you automate everything, YOU WILL CRUSH THE ECONOMY! You can't take away cashier, stocking, manager and every other job that regular grocery stores need without having major consequences. PLEASE stop, you have a great footprint already and have put tons of companies out of business but this grocery store business will have devastating effects. Stay with the online website and I'll continue to give you my business.",2
"I wasn't too happy when they completely ""banned"" sales of Confederate Flags. There is still a large market in sales for this kind of stuff. Whether people agree with it or not. You will always have someone that agrees, as well as disagrees. If you guys decided to ban a piece of American history, then you should ban the sales of Soviet Flags as well. As this flag and its representation goes contrary to how this country was founded. Could be considered very offensive as well amongst many Americans far and wide. This is the United States of America we should have the freedom to chose what we want to buy. I'm sick of businesses going along with this government that thinks they can dictate our lives. I think this was a total mistake Amazon. I hope my opinion is considered.",1

If I could give a negative 5star I would worst customer service I've ever spoken with. Yes I know most are over seas now but I can normal deal with them and understand what they are saying. Amazon's customer service representative are the worst. Couldn't understand 3/4 of what they were trying to say. And when. I could they kept transferring me. And asking the same identical questions which weren't hard to answer. I was transferred to a specialist of absolutely nothing because he asked the same questions as the Normal representative. And gave the same answer. Saying they could reship my item and never did. Said they had to transfer me. By far the worst customer service EVER. JEFF BEZOS KEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES SHAME  ON YOU!!!!!,0

"The declining quality of Amazon services just hit rock bottom for me. I ordered a 4 foot light fixture for my shop directly from Amazon, as a prime member. It was deliverd today by an Amazon delivery driver, not UPS. Pretty cool, right? Not so much. The fixture and package were smashed flat accross the center with a clear truck tire print. I soon discovered what was once amazing customer service, is now horrible. There was no option to speak with anyone over the phone, and my only resolution option is send it back and have it replaced! So this package which was ran over by a truck shipped from an Amazon facility, where it was picked by an Amazon employee, loaded by an Amazon employee, and delivered by an Amazon employee ... None of whom cared that it was smashed flat with a tire track going accross it? You've got to be kidding me! Now I'm told I have to ship it back ... More like customer disservice.",0
"At Amazon.com, I am a valued customer and receive respectful customer support and support. If I buy an item for $ 1, I can leave a review for this item and for the seller.After I bought two well-written, interesting books with an absolutely ordinary cover (the books fell apart) from Amazon.de, I wanted to write a customer review. My rating was rejected on the grounds that I did not meet the minimum order value. The minimum order value is 50 + EURO in one year. I was shocked.Amazon.de customer support stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1

"I have a surgery scheduled for August 16th and need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before. I have been trying to order clear protein drinks for two weeks now, and Amazon has so far failed to deliver all of them. The first product was 5 days shipping and the day before delivery the shipper broke some of the bottles--not Amazon's fault, obviously. The problem was how Amazon handled it. When I called, they told me they communicated to the company to initiate the replacement now, so it could be delivered  by the following Saturday. By the next day I still did not see a status change on the Amazon app for the product, so I called again--I was told by the person that she ""guaranteed"" I would receive the replacement by Saturday. Saturday arrived and still no change in shipping status to indicate the item was shipped--in fact, the only update was to state I was receiving a refund--so I called Amazon again. The first agent lied to me and tried to tell me he could ""help"" by initiating a refund (the refund had already been initiated the day before). I had the call escalated and I was told the item was never replaced and that none of the agents should have told me what they did. It was also too late to order that item as new orders would arrive after the surgery date. I looked for a different clear protein drink (that isn't red or purple). By now the surgery was only a few days away. The item I found indicated it could be delivered same day, between 5 and 10 p.m. Eureka, I thought. I ordered it. Of course it didn't arrive. That night the app updated to say that it would be delivered by 8 a.m. the next day. It wasn't. I called Amazon again. This time they have no idea why the item wasn't delivered and they still had no idea if or when the item might be delivered today. I had the call escalated. She didn't know either. She also couldn't reach the area that handles shipping to find out when the item would be shipped. She ended up refunding the first item (while not canceling it) and recommending a new order be put in to try to get the item delivered by this afternoon--halfway through the clear liquids day. I did as she suggested and put the second order it, but I really have very little confidence  Amazon can make it happen anymore. Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of failed and late deliveries with this company. It's become commonplace. While I was on the phone with the escalation team, I submitted my order for the first items I am moving to Walmart and away from Amazon. I will find replacements for the rest of my items and then cancel Prime before the end of the month. For those who may be holding off on canceling Prime because you like the streaming, be aware that after you cancel you can pay for a streaming-only option for $9 a month--less than the $15 a month or so we pay for Prime shipping. If I find the streaming worth keeping (TBD), that is what I will switch to. The rest of the company isn't worth my hard-earned money anymore. Moving on.",0

In the grass just inside the gate.I went up and caught the guy before he got in his van and I asked him why he didn’t knock on the door his ignorant answer was I didn’t want to disturb you.

"There were seven $100 gift cards purchases on my business account which I did not authorize. Trying to get to a human for reimbursement is virtually impossible. Once I reached someone (offshore) three separate times over a two week period, they told me it had been escalated and would be reimbursed within 2-3 business days. The third time I called, they said there was nothing else they could do because it was in a different department that didn't have a phone number! Only email and snail mail. So it's been 2.5 weeks, three of the same promises and apologies, no resolution and no phonecall as promised within 24 hours of each call. Shame on you Amazon for your poor customer service and while we know $700 is nothing to Bezos, to us middle class people, it's a lot.",0
I would not recommend amazon to anyone. I have noticed multiple times they have charged me more than what my order says I will be charged and every time I bring it up they either tell me they didn't make any charges or check with my bank. This time she tried to tell me they didn't take any money so I asked if I could send screenshots because she said the transaction IDs were incorrect I emailed the screenshots to her. Then she came back with that money is just on hold not taken out to call my bank. When your sneaking money from people your scamming them period! Even if it's a dollar here or there.,0
I wish I could make it zero stars these guys are complete fools! And a customer service people are from some other goddamn country that doesn't give a crap about anything and they won't let you talk to a supervisor they sent it to the wrong house twice!

"Its clear from reviews that customer service via India is the worst possible service available in the current market.  It is also clear that Amazon as a mega giant does not care one bit.  I have just spent two days and spoken to 5 people,  used the chat 3 times and am still, actually more, aggravated than than when i began.  The phone connection is inconsistent and full of static.  The people  accents are very hard to understand. I am first generation American and no stranger to accents but these reps are very garbled in their translation.  First I have twice been told an item that was never delivered would be replaced and that has never happened.  Frankly at this point I feel that they outright lie.  They lie and have no problem with it. And amazon as a company has no problem with the fact that the CS people lie and do not actually follow up on issues.  Second the delivery person here in USA is repeatedly delivering to the wrong address and no one seems to be doing anything about it. One rep actually told me they cannot follow up on something like that.  The items are going to the wrong address so often it seems to be purposeful.  Unfortunately there is no way for me to contact amazon delivery.  i tell india CS it is happening and they say they cannot contact anyone here.",0

"Amazon is a sneaky sneaky company that is on the same bandwagon as the monthly product subscriptions that automatically renew without your consent. Amazon asks if you would like to try out prime for free shipping, then, without any question, they use the credit card you have on file one month later to extract the yearly membership for a prime account which you assumed was ended after your free trial month. They send a sneaky email that is not from Amazon.com but from sales-news@amazon which makes you think it is a phishing scam and you immediately double delete. I am so disappointed in this aspect of the company and will definitely think 3 times before ever purchasing from this site again. I hate shady companies that auto renew- should be illegal to do this without permission.",0
"Sadly, Amazon Prime is no longer Prime! My last 4 orders have not been delivered on time. It seems the Phonex facility doesn't care about On Time Deliveries. Plus they have a ordinary habit of losing packages. I know that Phonex is only 1.5 hours from Tucson and I know they make several stops along the way, but, if it takes a driver over 12 hours to make his trip, you need new drivers!",1
"I am not keen on giving negative reviews, though Amazon deliveries are regularly lost or damaged. My recent book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable. I spend a whole day at home waiting for the parcel to arrive anytime before 8pm and just after 8 pm I get notified that my book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable. I want the old post office back, this on time delivery is nonsense.",0
"Fed up with poor customer service. No recourse for late arrivals and making me jump through hoops to prove orders were late when all information is in their system. The past 4/6 orders have been late and 1 of those never arrived. On one occasion have they offered me a FIVE DOLLAR CREDIT that can only be used on Amazon sold items which are basically non-existent for anything useful to me or relative to my shopping habits. The membership prices have increased only to offer worse customer service and worse shipping times. In this day and age it is almost just as easy and price efficient to shop on eBay. It won't be too much longer until that is fully accurate statement. I am done with the inconveniences and greedy tactics of Amazon which I used to admire as a company. I am fed up, and done. Please do not enable Amazon to rip us customers off and spend your money elsewhere.*I called about my most recent order being late I'm, to follow up about the previous recent orders, and cancel my membership. I spoke with supervisor ""Carla"", after being escalated from a first level rep due to no recourse, and we conveniently got ""disconnected"". During the call they stated they couldn't even cancel my membership. They would provide a link to which I could service the cancellation myself. How lazy? I guess I'm expected to reconsider while taking the time to jump through hoops to cancel. Afterward I receive a message that states she has applied a $40 credit to my account that I can only use on Amazon items, but without a proper conversation and acceptance from the customer. $40 credit for $1000+ worth of late equipment over 5 orders. How convenient it must have been to be disconnected from a ""problem"" customer, and be able to employ such shoddy customer service. My 8 year tenure with prime ends today.",0
"Amazon prime temporarily locked my account out of the blue for no reason. And it keeps telling me to contact the support team, only problem is, when I try contacting the support team, it tells me to log in WITCH I CAN NOT DO!!! So I am completely stuck, and because they have no other way of reaching out to them, then call (which I will not do from Denmark). Sooooo I guess I have to tell my bank to block any payments to amazon prime. Edit: I ended up creating another acount with another email, and got through to live chat. The promised to resolve the issue within 48 hours, so lets wait and see if thet actually does help",0
"Love how convenient Amazon is, and especially their Prime assistance. In the rare instance I get sent the wrong or damaged goods they are always quick to fix it...However, they do seem to have dubious business practices, undercutting other companies on their website etc, and dont have a strong employment record for their warehouse workers (I am sure their technical and business side have acceptable working conditions and compensation) which is a shame.",1
"I never have any issues with Amazon. I am a Prime member. Not only do they have literally everything you need, but with Prime, things come in so fast! Even when I didn't have Prime, things arrived in a reasonable time. Unbelievable prices compared to going to a store.",2
With 2 kids I appreciate even the smallest things made easy and amazon helps me do that a lot. Love the 2 day shipping and the deals I can find. Thanks again for being so helpful,2
"Amazon books orders. Mostly acceptable assistance from Amazon. However, oftentimes you get slightly dog eared edges to your ordered new book corners. This seems to be quite common showing lack of care in their handling of the books prior to or during picking or packing out of the order. This is slightly annoying. Overall order is fine. Selection of US published book titles very fine. Better probably than Waterstones or Book Depository too. Ordered were Krav Maga manuals titles and instructional all region DVD. I also benefited from a free offer one per customer of five pounds off my books order.",1
decent usage with amazon but could be better in terms of price transparency. I got charged for the order.,1
"We literally could not live without them, they have turned shopping from a chore into a fun experience and let us do it all from home. Almost every product on prime arrives exactly when it’s supposed to and any that do not are not the fault of Amazon. Selection is amazing, I think a more identified mark should be listed for 3rd party sellers like the mark for prime, most third party stores are top notch but I’ve seen some scams out there and when I tried to report them it fail’s sometimes. If you stick with Amazon stuff and not blame them for the delivery company issues you will have no problems ever. I cannot for the life of me understand why the overall rating isn’t close to 5 stars",2

"I used to use Amazon for almost everything because I thought they are the best. They are expansive compared to Ali express. The same thing on Ali express is 6 quid and on Amazon it becomes 29.99 how is it possible.Had a delivery from Amazon US packed by Amazon themselves and then it came all opened and ripped apart no customs check was sticked onto the parcel so I’m pretty sure customs didn’t open the parcel. Tracking didn’t even give any useful information. (BTW they use fake tracking as I tried to type the tracking they give on the site to the delivery people. It says tracking not found) It stopped updating for a few days so I don’t even know where the parcel is. Contacted Amazon, they said they cannot do anything about it because the tracking doesn’t update to delivered and asked me to contact the shipping company myself... surely that is their job. The staff were very unhelpful as they keep saying ask the delivery people as we don’t know who it is... and we cannot chase after them ourselves, then quickly ended the chat... Sent them photos of the products and left a review.  Received a message from Amazon apparently my review is fake and misleading as they do not want any negative reviews on the products... worst company ever. I will be shopping with eBay and Ali express from now on. Shame on you!!!",0
"I ordered a shower curtain, from amazon. It was about $25.00 or so, I wasn't happy with the curtain, so I set up a return with amazon, they picked it up a few days later, got an email from amazon, they got the package, and where refunding $15.00 to my account. With no heads up, where keeping half your money. So that will be the LAST item I buy from amazon. I wouldn't have given them a 1 star rating.",0

UPS said that they should have sent me two labels instead of one theitem that cost me $96 I ended up paying $18.19 for the box, I call Amazon customer service and they ran me around for 30 minutes on the telephone. I finally just hung up. I have other things to do. I cannot play these games with Amazon",0
Bought an indoor antenna for local channels and are surprised how well it works and how clear the reception is.  Thank you now I can get rid of high priced cable,2
"God... no comments. I made a very expensive purchase on Amazon from an original brand seller. In the end, I received a very used item, you could tell by many aspects. So Amazon offered me a return, but for some magical reason I couldn't bring it to my local Amazon fresh, but only Ervi, and that's it, from the 28th of Jan, my nightmare started. Ervi provided me with a receipt with an invalid tracking number, so neither I nor Amazon couldn't locate the parcel. At least at Ervi, you are talking to real robots, at Amazon you are talking to humans which are worst than robots. For almost 3 weeks, I was receiving misleading information that I am either getting a refund today, tomorrow I am not receiving it, contact Ervi, I have to wait 14 days and will get a refund, and in the end no, bla bla bla. Not only that people at Amazon are either rude or using pre-copied text messages. I even visited the shop where I dropped the parcel and a lady managed to get through to Ervi, Ervi couldn't locate it and said to contact Amazon. Amazon on that day told me 2 things, first get in contact with Ervi, report it as lost and we will give you a refund, second 14 days passed you will not get a refund. Hahahahha, my IQ dropped during these conversations dramatically. Thankfully, I have a proper bank, so I made a report and my bank will be dealing with these m*r*ns at Amazon. I am a customer of Amazon since 2017, and only after the pandemic, I started experiencing worse and worse deliveries in general. Either I am receiving used or broken things, or my parcels are simply lost. Amazon, Ervi, DPD you name it, deliveries are getting so much worse, it is better to get it by yourself.",0
To start off could not understand any of the reps(Indian) second was passed around to 4 different people. Third somehow I spent close to 2k on Amazon because I use to get 5% back  and somehow they reset my account to 0%. If I would of known I would of bought my stuff from a local business and get back 3% on my CC. Either way will no longer use Amazon because of the horrible customer service and lack of knowledge to their own product. P.S maybe you should screen you employees to speak actually English.,0
"Good assistance, with fast shipment, however they сheet us, if you have an Amazon prime they said shipment is free, but one time I checked same goods from Amazon account of my friend with no Prime and them I decided to place order from my Amazon account with Prime, and the price with free shipment was same as in regular account + shipment cost.",1
"Two weeks ago I placed an order which was confirmed immediately after. However, the following day I received an email claiming there was unusual activity on my account so it was put on a temporary hold. I was promised a review within 24 hours but now, two weeks later, nothing has happened. So, I created a new account and placed an order but now the same thing has happened. There is no email address or local number I can phone without spending a fortune on an overseas call. I am so frustrated and if I could get my purchase somewhere else there's no doubt I would not be attempting to shop with Amazon.",0

"after spending close to 40000$ on buying from amazon, they just decided to close my account and canceled all gift cards for bo reason . why, because they can and no one can complain about it . but this is way to far to just arbitrarily close an account knowing that we have diffective items that we cant return or exchange. I encourage every one not to be fooled my the name amazon because they don't care at all about customers or services.",0
I’ve always had fairly decent usages with amazon - it’s more the order supports! Ever since they started cap amounts (so spend £20 to get anything delivered free) and then outsourcing order. Numerous times I have had deliveries marked as ‘handed to a resident’ when it hasn’t and is either lost of hanging out the letterbox for someone to steal!,1
Well I'm not happy with Amazon and I won't be robbed by them again goodbye Amazon account,0
"Prime member since the beginning. Loved shopping and customer assistance. Starting about a year ago a lot/majority of reviews seem to be fake.Search function has major issues! If you select sort ' low to high"" for one item it shows over 2000 results instead of 1400. I use other sites to research items and often from other sites too..Amazon was great...was...not is...",1
"Amazon has a vast selection of products at great prices and is very easy to navigate. The one click option is great.  My only reservation is the seller rating system as one seller offered me money to remove a critical review, which left me doubting the overall validity of the rating system. I informed Amazon by email but had no reply.",2
It seems my orders are coming from places other than Amazon. I don’t like that these people get my email and spam me.,1

Rang customer assistances on first attempt not got to a person. 2nd time spoke to a very pleasant customer assistance person  only to find out I had been charged £12 and £5 for late payment. I have not received any statement by e-mail and they don't send in post. I note this has happened to others just a way of making money.",1
"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping assistance. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few ordinary and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman assistance suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1
"I wish a one star was possible. This is the third time amazon has taken unauthorised money from my account, and then said it does not show up in their system. I have emailed, after emailed, and the service is absolute trash, especially for stealing my money. What is this? A company? Or one for money laundering?Do your job. Don't steal money.",0
so much stuff to choose from u can always find what you want and usually for cheaper than everywhere else,2
"From my experience, it looks like Amazon is sneakily supporting BDS.My shipping address in an Israeli city in Samaria has started triggering an automatic reply ""does not ship to Israel"". Just on a hunch, I changed to an alternate address in the Tel Aviv coastal area, and instantly I saw that the same item DOES ""ship to Israel"". That's already bad enough. But when I tried to order the item, the order kept getting confirmed and then cancelled after 24 hours (5x). Among other excuses, Amazon support told me my bank kept refusing the payment request - my bank told me they never got any request. Finally Amazon told me my account is ""very sensitive"" -- SO sensitive they can't even tell me what's wrong with it by email, ""for security reason [sic]"". Then they stopped talking to me.I'm betting what's so ""very sensitive"" is my billing address, still in that city in Samaria. And the ""security reason"" is that if word gets out that they are discriminating against Israeli customers based on political bias, they will be liable under American anti-BDS laws.That very same week, Amazon was publicizing its new selling hub for Israelis. Talk about two-faced!BTW I had a similar experience last year with Amazon UK. Their 'customer care' people also gave me bogus excuses, and they also stopped answering my emails.All Israelis should think twice about partnering with, or buying from, Amazon.",0

"Updated review Updating my review from yesterday.So I am not going to let that one guy in my below review make me think that all of Amazon is bad. Yes amazon still inconvenienced me with the issue from yesterday but they made up for it today. This is the type of service I expected from only Amazon which is why I’ve been a prime customer for the past 10 years.Original review Wow... I’ve been a prime member for 10 years and have never had the customer service experience I just had. I ordered something yesterday that was time sensitive. I added to my cart more products than I needed to make sure it would meet he threshold for one day “guarantee”. I told them I didn’t care about the other two items but I needed that one item by tomorrow (which is today). Anyhow at 5:30, amazon tracking said it would come by 8pm. At 7:30, it said it would come by 9pm. I realized around 9:30 that it never came and now tracking said it will arrive within next two days. I called to see if there was anything they could do to make sure it can arrive by noon tomorrow. I felt like this was a fair request since they failed to deliver today as “guaranteee” on their site. He said “I can’t re route everything JUST for you package”. That was a really rude and unlike Amazon reply. After he said that, he got me in a fighting mood and I said so your “guarantee” is basically false advertising. He said “no if you ACTUALLY read our site... we are covered by that”. I was like “Hugh... I cannot believe Amazon is letting you represent them”. He also said at some point when he was reviewing my account  that I did not pay for this shipment  but after I hung up on him mid convo bc I was done dealing with his ignorant attitude, I realized that yes I do pay for shipping. I pay for prime for over $100 a year. Are you actually telling me that a non prime member is more valuable than a prime member? Anyhow... I am all for American jobs because is my country but it seems like those working in the other countries are WHOLE LOT more courteous and customer service focused. This “lead” seemwd like they jut pulled him off he street with his nasty attitude. I did call Amazon again to talk to another supervisor to make sure he “Dan” gets reprimanded. Anyhow “Dan” gave away a lot of Amazon’s inside scoop and how they think about their clients now. They value non-prime members more; their “guarantee” is not real and the verbiage on their site covers their guarantee not being real somewhere in fine print, and they are too big to care for you as client anymore. Also After speaking to this guy who was on the east coast in the US, their hiring decisions have declined because he was the worst.",2
"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",0
I asked for a change of address for the delivery - but they still insisted upon delivering to the original address. Eventually leaving the package on the doorstep! Totally incompetent.,0
Item couldn’t be collected because the local locker was stuck solid. Amazon immediately sent me a replacement plus a voucher in respect of all the hassle. When the locker was later opened Amazon let me keep that item too. Every business makes mistakes sometimes and I judge them by how well and how quickly they make amends. Excellent service.,2
"Most websites have this option of saving a wishlist, my favorite sites have the option of saving items on the websites personal wish list or on amazon's wish list.

Always been impressed with Amazon customer service. They have sorted any issues I had straight away and the agents are fabulous. This is why Amazon will always get my custom.I prefer to buy items actually from Amazon rather than ones that come from sellers as I’ve had a few problems with items from sellers. Amazon have always put it right though. Other companies could learn from Amazon customer service. I have to shield as I’m on chemotherapy and have relied on Amazon though lockdown. They are fantastic.,2

"Its not Amazon as suchBut Amazon order drivers, can they read or just dont bother. I have had quite a few deliveries over Christmas from Amazon... I always put a safe place in case Im not in.

So I come home to sopping wet packages, or nothing, even if it says delivered. I have had 4 parcels go missing now. I have complained to Amazon... They have now put on my ordersDO NOT LEAVE OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR, PUT IN SAFE PLACE. I thought that would do it..

Amazon is just as worthless as eBay. And what's worse is just like eBay they are cowards and hide behind the fact that they make it very difficult to try to contact them. They say they have easy email but I had to search the web to try to find it and still couldn't find it. Goodbye Amazon not going to waste any more of my money at your store.,0
I bought a part from a company on Amazon and received the wrong part I went with another sales site and the part came from the same seller. Wrong part again. I gave a 1 star review so nobody else would go through the same 2 week problem I did Amazon would not post. They only want good reviews. Well don't ask for my review again ! And as far as their guide lines they could suspend your account. OH NO WHERE WOULD I EVER BUY ANYTHING AGAIN! what a joke,0

Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's.

"For years Amazon has been one of my go-to websites for purchases, but just lately there has been a spate of deliveries where the box has just been too flimsy for the weight of the contents combined with the rough handling inevitably received from couriers, so they arrive crushed and/or torn with contents damaged or missing.  It's not the couriers' fault, it's poor packaging.  Amazon, please look again at your packing guidelines, heavy things need strong boxes that are well sealed.  If this keeps happening I'll be looking elsewhere.",0

What an insanely great website!!,2
Excellent working,2
"I’ve been using Amazon for several years, and it consistently delivers a great shopping experience. The website is user-friendly, making it easy to find what I need quickly. From books to electronics, the variety of products is impressive. The customer reviews are helpful in making informed decisions, and I’ve found the delivery to be fast and reliable. In the rare instance I’ve needed to return an item, the process was smooth and hassle-free. Overall, Amazon provides convenience and value, and I highly recommend it to others.",2
Good delivery on time nd best price Thankew amazone,2
"Customer support could be way better, managed to have my refund for a item but it took a while because the support was not able to provide it with enough proof, everything else was okay but that should be something to work on. (This was something related to Amazon Prime)",1
"Best prices, variety of items, shipping speed and customer service. Unbeatable!",2
"Yeah, they kind of took over the world, right. They do fine. Not great or spectacular, fine.",1
"I recently made a purchase, of a blender. It is working pretty fine. I really find it worthy",1
"I decided to not renew my Amazon prime subscription it's too expensive now and the service is appalling.Be warned before you cancel read all the small print. I have four Amazon devices and a fire stick. If I cancel I will lose all my files, photos, the movies I purchased from Amazon, I'm sure that counts as stealing in England! My money paid for the films, my money paid the subscription but everything I have on my devices They Will Erase!!! That's stealing at the very least. Maybe they don't have that law in America maybe the bald dumb ass who owns Amazon does it all the time. Reading the reviews on here I'm not the only customer being ripped off and lied to in a right royal way...forgot they don't have a royal family across the pond just a bunch of lying cheating thieves!Shame on you Amazon!!!!!",0
It is confusing to analyze if the seller is legit.,1
The customer support was fine.  The background noise at the call center was horrible.  I couldn't hear myself think when I had to answer the questions.  I felt like someone was shouting over me.  I've designed call centers for years.  I can tell when employees are sitting on top of each other without any sound attenuation.  It made my customer support interaction really unpleasant.  They need to do better.  They are Amazon and they are taking over the world.  They have money for better call centers.,1
"Orders always come on time and most have no issues. When I did have one last year, the rep was so nice about it, gave me a refund on the spot! He completely understood where I was coming from, unlike Newegg who takes a good 2 weeks to process a refund, needs an investigations team for the whole thing ,etc. Not to mention the prime with a free 30 day trial! And yes I mean free, no having to buy an annual membership and then you get the trial after that. ( you know who im talking about)",2
"Hands down the best website online. They took over, i used to use ebay but now it's all amazon!",2
"Awful ""customer service"" program. Everything is this self-service garbage. When you need more detail or an explanation that you cannot get with self-service answers, you are left in the dark. To actually speak to a real person, it is so hidden to get to it's beyond frustrating. Finally getting to an area that had a chance to message with a representative, there was ""technical difficulties"" and could not communicate. No simple email or anything. They should not even have a so-called ""customer service"" section, since it isn't. Terrible.",0
"I have just purchased some items from amazon to be shipped to my overseas home, I used to think amazon was great for fast delivery however, my latest order has still to arrive and for love nor money I cannot get to an online section on the amazon site to cancel the order (I have given up waiting over 1 month for it to arrive).  Come on amazon - just because you have shipped something and passed it onto the post office doesn't mean your responsibility ends there.  It is very frustrating to wait this long for 1 item and to not be able to do anything about it except wait.  The message - be careful when shipping items outside US/UK as they pass items on to local post offices who are not always the quickest in the world - which is why we choose amazon to use someone like UPS or Fedex who will actually ship something on time!!  Cost saving in postage is a short term gain but not a long term gain for my repeated custom...",0
"Amazon is another great American business ethics failure. Placed several items in my cart with a promised delivery date of 12/18-12/22 for all the items, then I ordered the items and paid. Guess what, as soon as they got my money they changed the delivery dates to 12/22-12-28 and 1/2-1/8. Needed items for Christmas, so of course I was a bit furious. Will never buy from them again. Amazon should be broken up by the gov't.",0
"Purchased a Honor Magic6 Lite mobile phone which was advertised with a FREE Honor Pad8.  Phone arrived but NO PAD. Contacted Amazon who stated there was a mistake in the listing and that the offer had expired.  FALSE ADVERTISING WHICH THEY REFUSE TO CORREC.

"Ordered a mattress during their prime 2 day deal event, booked in for shipment 2 weeks later but 2 days before the scheduled shipment I received a notification that the order had been cancelled as the item was damaged on receipt at their depot. I enquired as to why a replacement wasn't sent as it is still available to purchase on their website, but was not 'that was not possible' they informed me I could reorder the item, but at the new higher price (150 pounds more than it was on sale) it feels as if they simply didn't wish to honour the sale price which I feel they should have done.",1
Solid company out of 178 deliveries from Amazon I have only had two problems with orders. Both were handled with pride and professionalism from Amazon. Very polite drivers and good customer service.,2
They are rats They charged me 179 dollars for nothing they don’t explain why just make excuses they are rats,0
"Generally, I like the Amazon operation. However, there is one part of the operation that causes me concern, and that is book supply. At times over the years, I have bought 'books', which turn out to be little more than 'cut and paste' exercises by some plagiarist. The latest one claimed it was published by Amazon and I suppose it was via the Kindle platform. Amazon should stop this practise, plagiarism stinks. I just wonder how many copyright laws have been broken.",2

"Would give 0, but I cant, 2 items haven't arrived! So frustrated that I'm considering cancelling prime! More angry as delivery person took photo and said ""handed to resident"" lies, lies, lies, lies, LIES! So someone, somewhere is enjoying my wallpaper AND Christmas present from hubby! Hope you enjoy, because I won't be!",0
appalling customer serviceJust pull the plug instead of helping,0
"I buy almost everything through Amazon, it's so convenient when you're a Prime Member. Gotta love them for that! The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer assistance rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer assistance who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day. For an e-commerce company that deals with so many items, they did not a very fine job at properly packaging the glass items. Very disappointing!",1
Every time I order I'm left with tons of Packaging to dispose of!,1
This company always comes through with their promises. Ordered so many items throughout the years and they NEVER fail to deliver. 100% recommended!,2
I received an item which was a pack of 4 smart plugs. Only three worked. I logged into Amazon and contacted customer service through web chat. The refunded me my money and told me to keep the three that works. Excellent customer service!,2
"Amazon wasted a lot of my time.  First of all, Amazon.com kept telling me that my password was wrong and it was right.  I have 2FA so I'm pretty safe, but Amazon made me change my password and THEN didn't recognize it for multiple tries.  Once I got on the site, I tried to use filters to find a monitor that was a specific size, had speakers, etc., and I got so many irrelevant choices that I wound up ordering a monitor I didn't want and had to return it.  About the only thing good was Amazon seemed to make it easy to return the monitor I didn't want, but I spent a whole work day trying to find it and then it's still not returned because UPS hasn't picked it up yet.  But they will, I suppose.",0

Amazon a company that started great but has sadly got to big and is now getting terribly unreliable.My experience with Amazon and I don't use them a lot was awfull?I ordered two item's  a 2020 calender and a saint bernard design hoodie.The first item the calender I was informed was damaged in transit so I was refunded.The second item the saint bernard design hoodie I was told was running late.Two weeks later I used online chat to see how the order was progressing.It was explained to me that the item had been left in the Amazon locker as I'd asked them to do but had now been returned to Amazon as I had failed to collect the item.At no time was it ever explained to me the item was in the locker or any code sent to access the locker.I was offered the useall sympathetic approach and £5 to make it all better I which I refused.i didn't want £5 I wanted my item's they were presants for my partner.After this experience I would be very reluctant to use Amazon's services in the future?,0
"This organization is a joke. I happily cancel my Prime Membership today. I moved recently; and ordered items on Amazon for my new place. Cymax (seller on Amazon) shipped my items 5 days after charging my card. My husband had to reach out to them to have the items delivered. I finally received my order and the item is the wrong color. I reached out to the seller and Amazon. They approved my return; however, I'm responsible for shipping. I told the seller to pick it up. Now, Cymax wants me to take photos and email them. I can't find their email address online, you can't attach photos online through Amazon, and Cymax isn't taking calls due to this pandemic. I emailed Cymax (Amazon receives a copy) through Amazon app asking for the email. Neither organization responds.Amazon lost my lamps I ordered over a week ago. I asked for a replacement and that'll be another 10 days at a minimum. I asked for refund. I was told that it will take 7-10 business days per Amazon's new policy. A rep told me that I can have a refund for my Prime membership for the month. Her manager said I can't because I received free shipping. Free shipping doesn't matter because 2 items were lost; and I received something I didn't order. 2 reps told me I need to be patient. I'm not receiving a discount though Amazon can't be responsible for their end of the deal. Amazon doesn't know where my items are.",0

Getting Amazon Prime was a horrible decision! I have had so many shipping problems I can't even count them. I recently ordered some tattoo supplies. I am flying to NY tomorrow. I ordered the stuff on Tues and picked free 2 day shipping. As of Thursday my stuff has still not shipped. I now have to order from another company and pay a huge overnight fee. Definitely not woth the $100+ a year. It seems the bigger they get the less they care. Everything that made them a great company is slipping away,0
"As other customers have reported, drivers just leave the parcels on the doorstep and disappear. We have made 6 complaints about this recently, which have been ignored. The last straw was today when we found sheepskin slippers on the doorstep absolutely dripping wet. We have cancelled our prime account and got a refund. If only they would listen.",0
It was js terrible,1
"As a student, Amazon is my go-to place when ordering online. They have everything you need, student or not, and at cheaper prices than anywhere online most of the time. They also offer second hand items, which is useful for a History Undergrad like me, always buying big ol' dusty textbooks.",2
"Ordered a gift for my wife for Christmas from Paul's personal crafts.The first one I received was broken.which was no fault of sender, but obviously the courier as the packaging was badly damaged.I contacted Paul on Xmas day with pics. He sent a replacement first class.I received this today and my wife is delighted with her gift.The exceptional service and customer care shown by this business is second to none and would highly recommend This business to anyone.Many thanks Paul.EXCELLENT,,!!!!",2
Service is worse these days and prices too,1
"I've never had any negative interactions with Amazon.com itself. Whenever I purchase directly from Amazon my items tend to arrive quickly and in excellent condition. When I've spoken with customer service via live chat, my issues have always been handled to my satisfaction. The same cannot be said for certain sellers on Amazon. However, I won't name them here, as this review is for Amazon and not individual storefronts.",2

"Amazon are cun.ts.  It is almost impossible to order something without unwittingly subscribing to Amazon pPrime.  And,  of course,  there is no legal recorse because you mistakenly clicked on a obscurely labeled button agreeing to it.

After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1

"The worst company ever, my wife bought a phone from Amazon Italy and she received something else not worth a 10$ while she payed for a phone nearly 1000€, the worst in this scenario that we don't have any possibility to contact them as we don't speak Italian, at the end we asked an italian speaker friend to contact them on her behalf, they said that they will start the investigation, 2 days later she received a mail that her account is suspended, truly the worst company and the worst experience for an online purchase, they don't even deserve a 0.",0
My prime subscription has been cancelled for 3 months and every month the bank charge keeps coming up. The consultants at customer care keep redirecting me to different places but I can't seem to stop the transaction. Canceling an account is the biggest rigmarole and there just doesn't seem to be a solution. I keep being redirected and it feels like it is set up in such a difficult way so that it makes it exhausting for you and eventually you just give up. But at the same time I don't even have access to the account anymore. What a mess.,0

"I placed an order with Amazon on 3/20/20.  At the time I placed my order they credited my Gift Card Account, yet in an email they sent me states they do not charge until item is shipped.  That is a lie. Since May 20, 2020 I have been receiving emails from Amazon telling me they are sorry and I will receive and email when item is shipped.  I received an email on June 16 stating that my item would be shipped on July 25.  If they are not lying to me this time as they have been doing in the past, it will only have taken them 127 days or about 4 1/2 month to ship my item I ordered on March 20. I have ordered several items since 3/20/20 but not from Amazon.  I am through with ordering from Amazon.  I called them and I might as well been talking the phone to the wall.  He was no help and several times I had to ask if he was still there.  I started wondering if I was talking to a human or a computer.  I gave them one star and that was way too much.",0

"I use amazon ALOT and after a friend told me about ‘vine customers’ I made sure to write helpful reviews in the hope I’d be selected as one! Amazon removed my reviews and said I wasn’t allowed to review anymore as they thought I had posted a bias review for a friend or family member! The operator agreed that they couldn’t understand why as the item I had reviewed was Christmas cards, n I had bought about 30 of them all the same kind, but from different sellers on amazon and I left pretty much the same review for all of them! The one seller had no relation and the seller was miles & miles away! Amazon refused to tell me why they thought it was a dodgy review and wouldn't look into it further! So now I can’t become s vine customer and I wasted hours n hours writing helpful reviews! Oh and amazon allows pictures from reviews to be used on other websites as my face is plastered on an online article and the picture that was only posted on an amazon review!",0

"This review is split in two: - One for buying direct from Amazon (5* no question, best internet retailer by a mile) - One for buying from Amazon Market place (2* great until you have a problem) Amazon direct:What more is there to say about Amazon, when you order from them directly then it is flawless, any problems are taken away by their outstanding customer service team. They impress me every time. Amazon market place:Essentially one would expect that if you buy it via market place then since it goes through Amazon's engine and has their brand in front of it you'd think they would want to protect this and thus apply pressure to shoddy marketplace practices from some of the retailers. They don't. I bought some headphones, they broke after 3 months, so I requested a return from the company. Initially contact was good, then it all went quiet and I found myself contacting Amazon to request they gave them a bit of a nudge to play ball. Nothing. To cut a long story short, after several attempts with Amazon to get them to earn the cut of the sale that they put through their website I ended up going direct to the manufacturer. They told me that they didn't guarentee anything bought from the marketplace as there were a lot of fakes on there. I asked them to look at my phone anyway and tell me if they were fakes as I would have had far more to go back to Amazon with if they were and pointed out that they were in their first year of service and were guarenteed. Luckily they weren't fakes and they replaced them immediately, but Amazon's halo slipped dramatically for me as a result.  If you want your cut of the money Amazon then sometimes you have to do the dirty work too. If you steer clear of the marketplace then you will never go wrong with the mighty Amazon though.",2

"Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime. It just seems more like a waste of money to me.But I've never had an issue with Amazon itself.",1
"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.

I always get good and reliable service from amazon. Some of the sub-shops sometimes take long for delivery though.,2
I am surprised to see so many people that have had such bad experiences with amazon. I have never had any issues when returning items or with customer service,2
"We have been a Customer for several years now. Most of the time Amazon has been very good. The issue I have is it impossible to Ask a Specific Question about an item before ordering. Also, some of the items are vague- and are not marked New or Used. This results in needless returns, especially, when You’re spending over $100 on one item. There used a place where you could request Amazon packaging instead of Original boxing. How do I stipulate “AMAZON PACKAGING ONLY” for all my items? What happened to “Live Chat” ? Most of the time, everything goes fine. Just one Man’s opinion.",2

"I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer support numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer support saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a fine way to treat their loyal customers.",1

"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great interaction with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer support rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer support, is that if you ask a question about a item because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer support reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1

Reckless delivery drivers driving at high speed through a built up residential area with children around. After waiting on the line for half an hour they stated that ‘as I don’t have an Amazon account’ I would need to contact the police instead. What has an Amazon account got to do with a reckless Amazon driver. What will it take for a young child to be killed!! I have two kids myself and don’t appreciate or tolerate this kind of recklessness from either Amazon drivers or Amazon themselves. Shame on you Amazon what a sad excuse not to look into reckless driving in a built up residential area,0
"I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th.

"The go to place for pretty much anything.I am a so called ""prime member"". Over the years their deliveries have gotten worse in my interaction and items were being sent out but delivered to the wrong places without any attempts being made to deliver to me first even though I was home.Customer support is actually pretty quick and reachable. Very customer centric but there are, at times, moments when you have to push your complaints further. For example for damaged items that no one comes to collect? Communication between them: make sure you check on the status of your complaints because sometimes they cannot update things properly and you may end up being charged for something you were supposed to return and no one came to collect so they told you to dispose of it.",1
"Pricing may not always be the best, but it's competitive. Goods selection is stellar. Deliveries are on time 99% of the time. Customer service is outstanding.  They always resolve in my favor and are willing to spend as much time as it takes. They definitely go the extra mile.",2

I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer assistance levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the assistance on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
"Avoid this sh!!ty store. I bought giftcards 2 times, both times my account got suspended ""due to suspicious activity"" and I had to call 3 times and wait over 3 days until my account got reopened. Second time I ordered EXACT same thing happened. I have dual layer security on my account and everything at hand, still my account is ""suspicious"" and your order and account gets on hold at any moment they feel like it. No customer service can help you, the ONLY way is to fill out a form through the website and SCAN multiple documents from the bank and older payments to ""ensure you are the owner of the account"" . Words can't describe the idiotic level on this store and service.",0

It has become my go to place for all my shopping. I really am un-happy about the new tracking/targeting system. I feel that they are now charging me more for idem's that I may want. So I am now more careful about what I buy there and shop around more. I use to be a faithful Amazon shopper. Just a ordinary management decision. Amazon has lost 40% of my business because of this.

"The decent things about Amazon is that it is the most known and most trusted(in my opinion) website out there. It always tells you exactly where your package is.(I'm a new customer, and my orders haven't came yet) There are SOME reasonable prices like for a chain I ordered was 3 dollars. Now for the ordinary things. I've made 3 accounts to get my orders, and on all of them it says ""tHeRe WaS sUs ThInGs GoInG oN iN yOuR aCcOuNt""(it didn't look like that I'm just showing how dumb it is).

"I've had overall acceptable results with Amazon & will continue to use them.  I live not all that far from one of their order facilities, so my items arrive often sooner than they guesstimated.  I've had no trouble making returns for the times I needed to.  My recent usage is for a food item I've purchased many many times.  During COVID, the price rose & shipping times lengthened.  The price basically rose from $8 to $13 since COVID, which I accept.  Recently I re-ordered, as part of a larger order.  The other items arrived promptly, but this one was due to ship later with different dates given.  This time it didn't & I gave almost two weeks before contacting them.  That went well as I requested a call to me, which I got promptly,  The agent spoke clear English & understood what happened without further questions to me.  She processed a refund to my credit card, because she said, that replacement wasn't possible on this & I could shop for a new one.So looking, I only saw it for $32 - - over double what I had paid.  The trouble with Amazon, you often don't know who the seller is because so much is ""fullfilled by Amazon.""  So maybe the seller never sent it, realizing they could get a higher price due to some shortage.  So I didn't buy it for $32 & looked elsewhere.  I don't think Amazon themselves would do that, but a much smaller merchant might.",1

"on shipment time. When I order sometime for one day shipment I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
I am going to summarize my experience. They lost my package...they only offer your refunded money to a gift card not back into your bank/credit card. They do NOT tell you the truth from the beginning. I called within five minutes of ordering to change the address..instead of saying no they ask the address and said it would be delivered to the amazon locker that I ALWAYS use. Logistics reps are liars..all of them are liars! They didn't Change the address because then they offered to send my package to an address that was within 1 mile...waited...no delivery...next day..I get a message which said cannot access the facility for delivery. IT'S A HOUSE!!...Come to find out THEY NEVER CHANGED THE ADDRESS!!! LIARS!!! I called 3 days in a row...first...second...and third day of shipment to confirm everything so it wouldn't be a problem...STILL THERE WERE PROBLEMS...they kept switching me to reps that lie or could not really help the situation. The last rep kept me on hold so long and hung up! I called my bank. They will be handling the problem. AMAZON IS CRAP WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,0
"Amazon is my favorite place to order almost everything.  I am a Prime Member...worth the money.  I am careful about ordering from independent merchants.  However, when I had an issue with a merchant, Amazon helped to resolve the issue, and I got my refund (for an item that I never received).",2
This company product is very effective & it workes very nice,2
"Overall fine site. Delivers when they say. The only issue I have is my card was replaced while in a trial of prime that was 1.99. When I went to update it, they didn't even let me finish my week of prime (I was only 3 days in) and they charged me 14.99 right away. So I paid 16.99 for a month in reality and customer assistance said because I used it. (Um like people do with a PAID trial) I was just basically out of that money. So I'll order again but never will I ever use prime again.",1
"Amazon used to be a great site, but between the consistent fulfillment issues (sellers often listing products as being multi-packs with associated pricing and then sending a single item) and the slow, intentionally difficult to navigate customer service options I'm one more incident away from just cancelling Prime finally after being a subscriber for well over a decade.",0
I love to shop at Amazon.com as regular basis because they are most efficient and best shopping place at online. I will hoghly recommend anyone to shop here. Their refund process at prime is hassle free. Excellent customer service and you can get thing so quick on time.mmost of all they are trustful online source. I am feeling good to be Prime member enjoying my shopping every time. I love Amazon service.,2
"I like Amazon. It has a lot of selection and you can usually get what you need from there. They have some acceptable offers on there if you get them at the right time. Otherwise, it can be a little dearer than on the high street. You have to be careful with some of the cosmetic items, they’re not always legit. But Jeff Bezos is really taking the p**s with the minimum spend if you’re not a prime member. It’s been hiked to £35 spend now. I get that he wants everyone in the world to be on prime. But you’ve got enough money now Bezos, stop ripping us poorer folk off 🤬",1

I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a goods. Dont appreciate the attitude.,1
"I had a problem with an item, that I had purchased, that quit working after 2 weeks. Amazon had UPS pick up the item the next business day and they paid for the return. I have never had a company listen to me, like this before, about a purchase. I had a refund within a few days. I have been purchasing items from Amazon for years, but this was the first time I had such a problem. They have been wonderful to order from in the past, but now, I feel much more confident ordering items. I will purchase from them more now then in the past.",2
"I have been a very satisfied Amazon customer for many years, Now, at a vulnerable age I no longer trust them.  We are tricked into becoming prime customers when we have no desire to take advantage of the""benefits""they offer.

Amazon sucks....you pay monthly for 2 day shipping but I'd you don't get your item you don't get anything to cover that? You still pay!! I ordered 3 items all came together in the same shipment with the same guy...he delivered 2 items then never came to deliver the 3rd...which was the most expensive and the one I needed most....now this happens to me all the time with Amazon and this was just the last straw....I was told if the item did not arrive by 10 pm...I would get a refund for my order but still get my order. 10 can and went so I called customer service and guess what....I had to wait the 4 day period before they could issue a refund ONLY IF THE ITEM DIDNT ARRIVEA....THEN ORDER IT AGAIN AND WAIT ANOTHER 2 DAYS OR LONGER!!! nothing was offered to me for this until I got upset...5 bucks then another person gave me 20 only used for Amazon orders...so they make the money back!!! I canceled my prim bcuz why have it if I never get my orders on time and when they are late I get told we'll wait 4 more days and we will do somthing then....how is that 2 day delivery guarantee? Yea Amazon you honestly have poor customer care!!!,0

"Bought an item with next day delivery (Prime) and after no information on second day I called Customer Service. It's probably easier to get a bill through congress than to get to a human! Since it is a shipping problem they can't answer any questions. Not allowed access. Mid discussion I get an email that it will arrive tomorrow. It is coming from an Amazon facility 15 miles from my house and takes three days. When I ask what happened all I get is here is a discount on a future purchase and when transferred to a supervisor by the very courteous CS rep I get a very rude supervisor who informs me that she can't do anything about shipping.

Always get good service from Amazon. Never had any reason to complain.,2
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime support, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1

I want to order some shallow bowls, like pasta bowls - and I don't ever by any dishware made in China.  I heard stories a long time ago that they aren't as careful in regulating the dyes & other ingredients used in dinnerware.  We've all heard about the poisoned dog food from China that killed a few people's dogs.  And the worst was the tainted baby formula that killed Chinese babies.  If they don't care enough to protect their OWN children, then you know they aren't checking too carefully.  I see no way to reliably search for items Made in the USA.  I did find what claimed to be a ""Made in the USA"" section.  Then I typed in dinnerware, and it returned the same dishware that I already knew to be made in China.  Sweese was a brand that came up in Made in America.  And it is clearly Made in China.  And it's so time-consuming.  You have to drill down to the ratings, then search questions to find the info.  After 10 tries in a row with zero results from the USA, I gave up and headed over to WALMART where I was easily able to find what I needed.",1

Selection of US published book titles very fine. Better probably than Waterstones or Book Depository too. Ordered were Krav Maga manuals titles and instructional all region DVD. I also benefited from a free offer one per customer of five pounds off my books order.",1
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen.

"I ordered a garden shed on Amazon when it’s arrived it was too ugly to go into my garden. I contacted Amazon to get a return label and when I carried the shed that weigh 30 kg plus to the post office they told me that the postage was not covered, I contacted Amazon. They assured me they would get back to the seller who would contact me within two days to arrange return of the goods. Now six weeks later, I am being told by Amazon that The order was placed under a different email address and they can only deal with that person. I have pointed out to them that there must be 100 orders before and since that order all placed under the same email address the same delivery address using the same card. I have spent over 50 hours trying to get my money back I’ve been told on two occasions that they would force the third-party to return my money within seven days which hasn’t happened. I have wrote three letters to their managing director and finally I had an answer over the phone this evening.. The person on the phone has given me absolute no confidence of me getting my money back. He’s saying it can’t be looked at under GDPR The order was placed under a different email address and I’m asking him how that’s happened when all the other orders are showing placed under the right email address. I’ve also asked him when when I applied to return the goods why it came out off my orders on the app making it very difficult for me to take the matter up with their customer services. I am also very concerned that the third-party that I placed my order with on the Amazon website have ceased trading and why Amazon allowing companies that do not trade to sell on their website. The guy on the telephone could not answer that question said he would report it, but I would hear nothing back as it would stay an internal matter. this is clearly not good enough and they as they are not protecting their customers.",0

As long as the item hasn't entered the dispatch process,you'll be able to cancel it.*However, this was not true and it actually was impossible to cancel the order, either on my account or by contacting the supplier ( as per automated message on my account) who said that only Amazon could cancel it and also said that my payment was still pending , which is also untrue.I am now told by their advisors that it is not possible for them to cancel the order until it has been dispatched!!!!! I think I am just being fobbed off with random  excuses/explanations.

I had an order that showed to be delayed from the promised date, when I called they gave me five dollars off to use as credit; The package actually got there on the original promise date anyway. They also hold their sellers to the same standards. When I had purchased a mattress and adjustable bed from the website and had a problem they told me to call the distributor company and if I was not satisfied with a solution I was to call them back and let them know. For a very large company they operate like a small business with great customer service.",2

"Please stop collaborating with Airmee in Sweden. They never deliver on time, and whenever I ordered a item from Amazon, I end up with local order with Airmee without my consent. They failed to deliver such time-sensitive items as medical items or a birthday gift, even when I paid an additional fee to Amazon to ensure fast order.",1

"Always waste more than an hour to have simple questions answered... We could ignore the fact that their English is not the best if they were actually helpful, but besides not being able to understand what you write, what they write is also not really clear.Was forced to keep on chatting with someone when I specifically requested to have the chat transferred to someone else I was told:- there is no such option (when they constantly transfer me around from person to person when they can't answer questions);- and shortly after I was also told ""If you confirm the issue we can transfer to relevant team"" - what kind of treatment is this?If I no longer want to have this person wasting my time, why am I being forced to speak with this person? Constantly kept on asking this person to either transfer or end the chat - and they just kept on refusing and taking the longest time to even reply.Every single time I contact them they are always inattentive (probably working on multiple cases at once), slow to react, & not knowledgeable about what they are saying. Huge waste of time",0
I feel like Amazon has gotten worse over the years. Alibaba and Etsy have much better variety of items at a much cheaper price.,1

"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 items that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 item that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of items, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
"Amazon was the only place listing Scrooged (that I could find at the time) and so I ordered it immediately and it came within 2 weeks (from America).Also purchased MP3s recently and they have a ""we call you"" service which was fantastic and resolved my issue immediately.",2

"Amazon customer service used to be amazing, on average I would receive 2 parcels a day over the year. However I’ve noticed in the last 3 to 4 months a decline in the quality of their chat customer service agents as-well as being hit and miss on getting refunds for returns on occasions. I’ve had agents being quite slow at replying and sometimes quite blunt to me. They seem to have lost their politeness and willingness to help. I was recharged today for an order I returned about 5 months ago. The agent gave me two totally different reasons for this recharge and then cut me off the chat…. I’ve never seen their customer service like this and it appears to be a continuous trend. I hope their delivery drivers are not affected as they are very good.",0

I cannot sit around and wait for someone who may deliver a product that should have been here already. Their delivery continues to deteriorate. Packages are tossed over a railing, in plain view. That makes it easier to steal. Amazon use to be reliable.  We use them at least once a week. I may have to find a more reliable company.",0

I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1
"Amazon used to be incredibly reliable, consistent, and user-friendly, however lately there's been an exponential increase in wrong deliveries, falsely reported deliveries, and stolen deliveries. I understand things happen, but I believe that when they do, particularly if one customer is experiencing this frequently, the customer should be penalized as little as possible. When voicing these concerns after not receiving the fourth delivery within a month, I was met with condescension and a lack of consideration. I have found their customer representatives to be snarky, demeaning, and unwilling to actually fix the issue or offer compensation. Even their apologies are rude. Sad because this business used to be hospitable and efficient. Seems this conglomerate has gotten larger than they can handle. ",0
"I go to Amazon for many online purchases nowadays - on the whole their prices are some of the best, and the choice is excellent. There is a lack of detailed descriptions on some items though, and occasionally you take a gamble that something is the correct dimensions or is exactly the model you are looking for. I would happily recommend it though.",2
"I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th. I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.",1
"I was loving Amazon shopping until I required some customer support in the Netherlands. It is my third time phoning to resolve a login issue, after holding for 22 minutes and being transferred I was cut off. My second attempt resulted in a commitment to resolve my issue within a few days, that was over a month ago. Because I cannot login to my account my only alternative is to phone which is not working. Very sad indeed. I did not mention that it was also difficult to find the local phone number. Disappointing service Amazon Netherlands!",0

"Out of the 14 parcels I ordered last week (mostly decorations and gifts for my childs birthday) only one arrived.  Four were left outside on the street - and subsequently stolen, the others were either cancelled after showing they were 2 stops away, the wrong product was sent or they just never showed up.  I've spent hours chasing them.  Paying Prime for next day delivery and lucky to get the parcels at all.  Needless to say I have now cancelled my subscription.  If you have an alternative company, use them.  Amazon is simply awful now!  Was told to raise a formal complaint, of which they didn't respond to.",0

"Amazon scams people!!! I don’t order things from amazon often, but sometimes they do have some cool stuff. I ordered one thing. When I checked out there was option for a one time FREE prime delivery. I was then automatically charged for delivery as a separate transaction! It wasn’t a big charge so I decided to let it go, but now my package is two days late and I received an email that I will be charged monthly for a amazon prime account. You know the one I never wanted. I called the customer service and line and after talking to a stupid machine for 30 minutes I was transferred to a real person just to answer the same questions again! She said the package was delayed and won’t be here for 5 MORE DAYS!! No refund for the shipping. The free prime shipping trail is a scam. It is not free, and it is not any faster than the regular free shipping! My package was important and time sensitive and I would have paid for the faster shipping if I had known this would have been a huge issue! When I told the customer service rep that she immediately tried to refund me. I told her that I still wanted my item, but I wanted to cancel any further payments! VERY annoyed with the service of amazon in every aspect. I will not be order ever again unless this issue is resolved to satisfaction! It is not just OK for packages to be a week late and then receive no explanation!",0

"I'm 50-50 on Amazon. There are sales happening all the time whether it being a small one or a big one. I bought an item from them and it came perfectly well. No blemishes, no defects, works as advertised and great. But the order wasn't. Firstly, I was promised 2 day order. 2 days later, I checked the status only to realize that it will be delayed till the end of the week. And this isn't the first time too. Amazon really need to work on their order consistency.",1
"My interaction is purely based on the website and processes, but overall amazon with get a 3/5.Purely because a lot of items are the site can 3rd party and made with cheap material while sellers sell items at a high price.However amazon do plenty of offers on normal everyday items and I've not had much issue when contacting them if I have problems.My only gripe would be that sometimes some items are sent out via other couriers such as Evri, DPD, Royal Mail etc, and I wish they would state on the order on the website that this chosen courier is delivering my parcel instead of an amazon courier.",1

"I love amazon, the next compare thing is ebay, but amazon is much better cause only deal with professional sellers. However, I usually to buy a lot of OTC meds, and most sellers do not put the product details of the product.

"I haven't been very happy with the Amazon Prime Service for a while now.   I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about assistance I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding shipment.  Normally their shipping and shipment estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.",1
"Amazon is by far, my absolute favorite online store. They have just about anything you can imagine, apart from illegal items. Any time that I have had an issue with them, they resolve it quickly, and painlessly. I love the wide range of items that the store has to offer, and the prices are usually quite reasonable. Shipping is always timely. A lot of the time I receive my item before it was expected to come. Definitely a store that I buy things from frequently.",2
"The local Royal Mail sorting office would be half empty if it wasn't for Amazon's business. But no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list: there is a razor sharp focus in the search engine, but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent.  Sorry guys, but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset, if we ever had a title or author to start with.",1
please control your price during this period.,1
"Subject: Complaint regarding refund issues and poor customer serviceDear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to you with great dissatisfaction and frustration regarding my recent experience with Amazon. As a loyal customer, I expect a certain level of service, which unfortunately has been severely lacking in my recent interactions with your company. I made a purchase on Amazon, using my own funds, for an item. To my disappointment, the wrong size was sent to me not once, but three times. In order to expedite the process, I used the return refunds provided to me in gift card form and immediately repurchased the item. However, due to the repeated errors made by Amazon, I finally requested a refund for the item to be returned to my original account.To my dismay, it took four weeks and multiple attempts to contact customer service to receive a response. Eventually, the refund was processed, but contrary to what I was informed, it was credited back to the gift card instead of my original account. I subsequently reached out to seniormanagers and was assured on four separate occasions that the refund would be transferred to my account within seven days.However, it has now been an unreasonable amount of time, and I still have not received the refund in my original account. Furthermore, when I contacted Amazon again to rectify the situation, I was informed that they could not refund the money from the gift card, which was originally my own money.I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by this level of service. It is unacceptable for Amazon to provide false information and promises regarding refunds, causing undue inconvenience and financial loss on my part.I kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution. I expect the refund to be immediately credited back to my original account without any further delays. Additionally, I would appreciate appropriate compensation for the time, effort, and frustration I have experienced as a result of Amazon's errors and poor customer service.I value my long-standing relationship with Amazon and hope that this complaint prompts a change in the way you handle such situations. I trust that you will take immediate action to rectify these issues and restore my faith in the company.I look forward to your prompt response resolving this matter.Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.Yours sincerely,Nigel Lane",0
Great way to do business quick and easy,2
"I unfortunately don’t have the representatives names, but I had an item never show up. I contacted the customer support for a replacement. The lady who I first talked to LIED saying she could expedite the replacement and get it to me in 2 days. After 4 days, it still never showed up and the statement on my order said Jan. 8. The lady whom I talked to after the 2nd order was placed, said they could not expedite any replacement item and was quite surprised another representative would tell me that. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon who has an interactiond representative LIE TO A CUSTOMER. However, the Second Lady who Told me they could not expedite my order was nothing but absolutely wonderful.",1

It's been 7 days now since they collected the mattress and the refund is still nowehere to be seen. I placed the order 2 weeks ago and I'm sleeping on the sofa because of you as I can't afford buying another mattress until you process the refund.How is this fair?",0

"I have been having the worst interaction on Amazon. First, I paid for a 75 dollar controller that was supposed to be brand new. The controller turned out to be used and the code that came in the box was already redeemed. Now I just subscribed to prime thinking they will charge me at the end of the month. That was a farce because they just took 15 dollars out of my account within 5 minutes. Customer assistance told me it will be 3-5 business days until I get a refund.",1

"Decent online shop, friendly customer support and fast shipping, I only have two minors complaint about Amazon and hope they can improve on it. Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement. SERIOUSLY!? For the past 10 orders, I do not have any problems with my billing address. In the end have to create a brand new account.",1

"I tried purchasing a laptop from Amazon (my first purchase ever from Amazon). I paid for fast shipping, but instead Amazon wanted to wait a week to ship my purchase ""because I am a new customer, they have to verify that it is really me"". I decided to cancel the order, because I verified with them over the phone that it was really me, but they have such a bureaucratic system regarding payments that I felt like I was just talking to a wall when speaking to their customer support. Overall, I think Amazon has a decent assistance in some aspects, so that is why they at least get three stars.",1

THE CHECKS TAKE 6 TO 8 WEEKS YET 5 TIMES I'VE ADVISED THEM I WANTED THE CHECKS WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE BY NOW IF SOMEONE TOOK CASE MANAGEMENT SERIOUSLY AND I DIDNT HAVE TO TALK TO 15 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEN YESTERDAY 10/18 ALMOST TWO MONTHS LATER. THEY EMAIL ME SAYING THEY RFUNDED A MASTERCARD EXPIRING IN 2024. IF YOU COULDNT REFUND THE NEW DEBIT CARD I ADVISED YOU OF THAT IS NOW CONNECTED TO THE SAME ACCOUNT AS THE OLD CARD, HOW DID YOU RANDOMLY SELECT A MASTERCARD (DIDNT EVEN TELL ME THE CARD NUMBER) THAT IS ON MY ACCOUNT TO REFUND! AT THIS POINT I NEED TO GET LEGAL INVOLVED FOR A REFUND LESS THAN 100 DOLLARS. AND MENTAL SUFFERING AS THIS IS CAUSING SO MUCH ANXIETY FOR ME!",0
Amazon have lost 3 of my orders in the last 30 days. I give up!,0
Is it possible tu put less than 1 star ???? The customer service rep lied to my face telling me that my order was in advanced shipping and will definitely received my order tomorrow. Then less than 15 mn later my order was pushed back to 10 days later. And the answer from Amazon was if you bought Prime it will not happen. Oh my god is that BLACKMAIL?  But yes it is. Do not use them again. Please boycott them.,0
"Generally a decent website, but I think it's a hit and miss. I've been using Amazon since 2006 and would consider myself a dedicated customer. There are lot of items for sale and it's very easy to find them. However it literally can cause me anxiety waiting for a order or wondering whether I'd even get my order. I've had usages where the order drivers don't bother knocking or they've left my package in a communal area. I even got £5 compensation one time because of their lazy approach to order. I now try to mitigate this by using Prime and selecting the precise date on which I want order. But that's too much of an onus on a customer.",1
"Wasn't the greatest support I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
"I no longer receive most of my items in two or three days. It takes almost a week. Normally within the time frame they give. I love Amazon. You have to understand how much they have grown! It is impossible to make sure all of their customers get there shipments in two days. Let's be logical. I was disappointed when my stuff started taking a week to get here as well. Amazon has always done the best they can for me, and I appreciate it. Even when I'm not the easiest to talk to.",2

They refuse to do a complaint and only call it feedback, so not a complaint!Will be cancelling my Prime, especially after the rip-off adding adverts to Prime video, then this service!",0
always manage to find what i want,2
"I've been ordering from Amazon for a few years. All shipments from all vendors, including Amazon, have gone to my account address that I attempted to use today, but which was rejected as an address the product could not be delivered to. The product was a package of three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, shipped directly from Amazon.When I used Amazon chat to inquire about this, I was sent boilerplate about hazardous materials and oversized/overweight products. But these were three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, so the issues put forth as an explanation were nonsensical. Next, I asked for a supervisor, but was told the supervisor would simply give me the same explanation. I was, however, asked if I would like to bypass my Prime membership shipping benefits, and use freight forward with Fed Ex.Since the product is a small package of vacuum cleaner bags with a shipping weight under one-half pound, all of this complication over shipping was obviously the consequence of mismanaged metadata at Amazon for this product. But since the Amazon representative was both stubborn in securing more sophisticated support from a supervisor, and was suggesting I could have the product shipped without using my Prime account, it all felt like a scheme to solve a problem at Amazon by getting me to accept their dysfunction and pay unnecessary and inappropriate shipping fees.",0
"I love amazon, products arrive in the time they say,custumer service very good,couldnt be happier",2
"Lies lies lies!!!I like may others pay a yearly subscription fee for a “prime membership”. I’ve lost count of how many times that “service” has failed me.Today being the latest. Not only has my parcel not turned up, but I also received a message saying “failed delivery attempt”, when no attempt was made whatsoever.I know this as I waited in all day, and am now expected to waste another day tomorrow waiting around again.",0
It’s sad when you constantly spend your hard earned money on Amazon and when it’s there turn to fix the issue that you are having they make you feel like your being questioned by the fbi i think after the holidays I’m going to cancel my Amazon account and go over to Temu,0
"I've been a Prime member for many years. It's not perfect but I find Customer support is quick to resolve missed deadlines and defective fines. My only complaint is a lot of sellers are selling expired fines. So my advice is to check the dates on everything and contact customer support if you've received old items. It's true some reps are difficult to deal with but just keep escalating until you get results.Prime Video is another issue altogether. I refuse to pay extra fees for ""no commercials""This is a ridiculous money grab since a lot of content you can get for free on other non subscription channels.The above reasons are why I'm giving Amazon a 3 star rating. IMO they can do better!",1
"I’m really impressed with Amazon. I’ve been a customer for years and still no problems. Recently, I was worried that a product was late. I raised this with Amazon and they returned all costs.",2
With current situations still managing to get my deliveries at decent time rate.,2
Disclaimer: this review was initially posted to the UK site however I just noticed that the profile is unclaimed.I see all the negativity around Amazon however I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with them so far. Got a full refund on a 2yo earbuds which I’m pretty confident that no other shop would honour. Amazon still remains my favourite online shopping option.,2
"Ordered spark plugs for a 2000 Honda. The plugs were wrong.  Spent an hour and a half trying to resolve the issue, with no satisfaction.  Spent the last 30 minutes on hold. F^$# you Amazon.  I canceled my account.  Zero satisfaction.",0

They’ve gotten difficult over the years.  I recently had items in my cart and called prior to ordering and the second rep (Amazon Locker Specialist) explained the items weren’t eligible for Amazon Locker and why but to go ahead with shipment to a UPS Store and they’d make an exception and reimburse the per package fee.  I received the three packages today and called for the $15.  The first agent insisted after I explained it all again there was “no record” like I’d made it up.  I think their game is for the consumer to give up. He transferred me to a supervisor who also made me explain it before mentioning they “have a recording of the conversation” and she credited $15.,1
"Love Amazon, but the shipping companies they use always leave packages on front doorstep and then snap a picture.  As if that would prevent someone from stealing them.  Then when you complain, it becomes your problem!",1
"I ordered a cricut joy from Amazon and I picked the time they offered for delivery. When it didn’t show up at the time they promised, I discovered it was in Texas still. I live in Florida. I then found out it was being sold for $20. Cheaper. Because it was so late they gave me a discount and promised they would get it to me the next day. I saw it eventually made it to the Lakeland Amazon distribution center in Fl. 2am. In the morning. When I woke up, it was still there, but my other package that was there shipped and was out for delivery. At 3pm I called them and before they picked up my phone call a notice came across my phone saying it was being delayed. Ok, still waiting for them to pick up my call. Some guy finally answered, and said it got damaged and my only option was put my money back on Amazon credit or back to my account. After waiting three days extra and they did nothing to fulfill my order. I tried to write my review, but they wouldn’t publish my review because it wasn’t about the product. I could not find a place on Amazon to complain about there shipping, and there should be a place. I got my cricut joy and also bought a hammock elsewhere. They lost about $400. From me over shipping. I wish I could just not buy from them anymore, but from now on they are my last choice to do my business with.  Also the money they promised to give me on my account for the late shipment disappeared, so they just took back the machine and canceled my reimbursement. Shame on you Amazon.",0
Item showed as delivered but never arrived. Thankfully Amazon refunded me after 3 or 4 calls to explain this. Annoying though,2
"Good prices, quick order (via prime) and excellent customer assistance mean that I now buy most things through Amazon. They have removed the stress and risks of buying acceptables for me and I now receive a few parcels a week from them. In the rare cases when there are issues contacting customer assistance quickly resolves them.Update from my original 5 star review. Amazon have become more aggressive as they seek to monetise their high market share. Alexa continually tries to sell you more assistances (you cannot stop this) to the point of ruining the user interaction and has today signed me up for an audible subscription it offered my six year old and she declined  (Alexa has the recording DON’T sign me up).Customer assistance now don’t offer email and the chat use literally two hours of life I’ll never get back refusing to acknowledge the issue or allow me to raise a complaint. I used to be a a loyal customer who trusted Amazon to treat me with respect but increasingly feel more just a Pound sign in their eyes",1
"I STOP buying on Amazon.  Service is now so terrible. Products are expensive. I change and order from now on from competitors such as Ebay, Aliexpress,...",0
I joined Prime and ordered 2 seperate products one took 7 days to arrive and the other 5 days not the next day delivery promised by Amazon. Furthermore their response was odd a long email in an English I don't know and condescending. Little wonder the ASA are investigating this,0

cheap and fast; they sure are. however they cant help me in the sales process; just undercut everyone else who can,1
Screw Amazon I ordered a couple things and I did not receive it and they refuse to give me my money back so now I’m out of like 60.00 won’t order from them again I’ll just use it for prime video!!!,0
"I can't stand their customer service people. They are so rude, and I have no idea what happen to Amazon. They used to be so good and now they are so poor in service. I am so mad that I shipped the 3 products back that was not as advertised in description. They told me that I have to wait 2 weeks to get my money back.",0
Recieved quickly but the package was not good,2
nice ppl kakakkakakakk,2
"Amazon can be both acceptable and average. When it's acceptable, it will take your orders and deliver them smoothly. When they are average, they will charge your debit card twice just to see if you have money in your card....yes that's the reason they gave when I asked why. (rolled eyes)I will always cancel order when they try to charge my debit card a second time. They can very well take the money that was previously put on hold but nope, they want to charge again! So I will always cancel and bring my business elsewhere even if it costs a little more.My recent order was with the same debit card and they did not charge twice. Just once, take the money and delivered the acceptables. Now why can't they just do that all the time?? Charging twice is off putting and defo made me shop elsewhere every time they try sh_t like that with my debit card. They can go borrow money from the bank if they need floating cash.",1
Fantastic website and items and customer sercice!!!,2
"Always receive my items as stated, and after having a few minor issues here and there the customer service advisors are always friendly and happy to help. Never had a real issue with them I’m a loyal customer for over 5years",2
"I know this behemoth is not well liked, but when you live out in the middle of nowhere they are fantastic. I ordered a sack of flour yesterday afternoon, it has just been delivered. Whilst the price is slightly higher than if I buy direct, Amazon does not charge me ridiculous shipping charges and doesn’t then take two weeks to send it.",2
DO Not use Amazon right now.Too many people including myself have had our payment info hacked and removing money and ordering of amazon from our credit card.No number to call to speak to someone or even email.How could AMAZON LET THIS HAPPEN?I am out so far 1200 dollars in a matter of 3 days.,0
"I don't know if the issue I'm having is too complicated for Amazon representatives or if Amazon decided not to be helpful anymore (it seems like Amazon's new policy is ""we're insanely big so we don't care about our customers anymore..."") but I've been having issues with Amazon Chat representatives attitude in the last 3 months.I received no help, extremely unfriendly service and felt like no one is willing to help!!! it really felt like Amazon doesn't care if I'm going to stay a loyal customer or not.I don't know if anyone with ability to do anything is going to read this but this is the main reason why I'm not going to make any additional purchases on Amazon and will not renew my membership as well as stop using my Amazon store Card.I truly hope someone who cares will read this and be able to do something. Until then, I'm not going to shop on Amazon or use any of Amazon additional services...",0

"This morning I found a group packages left on the corner of my yard right next to a public sidewalk. Five Amazon Prime packages, for addresses other than mine, had been dumped on my property by, I presume, the Amazon Prime delivery person. I called Amazon Customer Service and spoke to a representative who was argumentative and unhelpful. I explained that these were all Prime packages for people who were paying Amazon a subscription fee in order to ensure quick, safe, responsible delivery. I told her that I live a 15-minute drive away from the Robbinsville, NJ Amazon Warehouse Fulfillment Center at 50 Canton Way and did not understand why this problem could not be resolved today. The Customer Service rep said she would file a report, but did not ask for any of the tracking numbers for the packages. She then told me just to leave the packages outside and someone would be by-- sometime--to pick them up. I waited all day for that to happen.Late this afternoon I called Amazon Customer Service again. This representative was more pleasant and helpful. Apparently, the first Customer Service rep with whom I had spoken did not even file a report when this rep looked to find it. This second rep took tracking numbers with which to file a report and said it would take three days for a pickup to happen for redelivery, which is Amazon's policy, even for Prime subscribers! Again, I said that was unacceptable. For example, Amazon now delivers prescription medications and what if someone is waiting for a prescription to be delivered. I told the rep a three-day redelivery for Prime does not make sense, is bad business, and that I would deliver four of the five packages to the houses whose locations in my neighborhood I know. As for the fifth package, Amazon will actually have to have someone do their job and come to pick it up for redelivery. I also expressed that I do not work for Amazon. With that being said however, the four packages I said I would deliver are now at their correct addresses.Amazon Prime buyer/subscriber beware. I would have left a rating of ""zero"" if that had been an option. Perhaps Amazon's founder and former CEO, instead of now spending billions of dollars looking for a new planet on which to live (funded in part by Amazon Prime subscribers), should have ensured that Amazon's workforce is valued, not recklessly overworked, that the employees are responsible, and Amazon has logical, work-flow procedures in place in order to deal with problems that are not so difficult to solve.",0
Has been consistently efficient and I have been using them for years. Amazon almost always has the lowest prices too!,2
Zero accountability  they block you. I've been a client for almost eleven years  but I think I'm gonna leaving them. Unskilled customer service operators; their answers are useless and they are also rufe and unpolite,0
"I have been using Amazon for many purchases since 2007. I now use their grocery delivery service. I tried other companies hoping to get better prices, but the service was unreliable, so I always end up going back to Amazon. Customer service has always been good and refunds are always prompt.  My only complaint is that their grocery prices are a little too highbut their good delivery service makes up for paying a little higher than their competitors.",2
The customer service is always AMAZING!!! So helpful and friendly and resolves any situation. I shop a lot with Amazon and this is the reason why. Makes a huge difference and the experience much more pleasurable than other companies.,2
"I love the Alexa devices, I really do!",2
"Product purchased was OK. But. Amazon likes to fill your email box with demands for reviews.  Quite a nuisance, so I did.. and my review was rejected as ""not in compliance"" all I noted was the item bought was ""OK"" but not as fine as others for same price. Political correctness? perhaps. If they don't want honest albeit free speech... appraisals then stop asking for my opinion.",1

"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after prices were raised and prices are higher than in stores already. Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1
Fast delivery. No bad experiense! Thumbs up!!!,2
"Got a low quality item, but the refund was fast so I was able to get something better from a different seller, it was stressful usage though.",1
the buy and order is fine. but lately i reviewed some items that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing fine to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
"Nice goodss, great quality. Don't like shipment time.",1
I shop for everything online at amazon.com! I can get just about anything and sometimes with free shipping. I highly recommend this amazon.com.,2
"I've had another great experience with Amazon this past week and just wanted to give them a little more praise. I had signed up a couple weeks ago for a free trial of their Prime membership and while I liked it, I don't think I'd use it or its services enough to justify the cost so I had planned on cancelling it before my trial ran out... but I forgot to cancel in time! I noticed the charge to my bank account and called Amazon that day to say i didn't want the service and wanted a refund; I expected to have a huge fight about it but lo and behold, the first customer service rep I talked to took care of the charge right away as soon as I had explained my issue! No fuss and no fighting! That's the way a company with any sort of membership plans should be ran. A+ work Amazon!",2
"Everything okay, sometimes I get order faster sometimes not. I only buy through Amazon, not 3rd person. But one annoying thing they do not accept different recensions than 100% positive, if you wanna put truly opinion they will not accept your recension. That's scamming of people.",1
I have had great experiences with them for nearly a decade. My only complaint is that I wish they would pay their workers better wages.,2
"It's OK, but you're just giving Bezos more money.",1

"I've been a Prime member for longer than I can remember and while I've definitely had issues with orders through amazon, they always solve them promptly.

Amazon is THE go-to retailer.",2
"My interaction is purely based on the website and processes, but overall amazon with get a 3/5.Purely because a lot of items are the site can 3rd party and made with cheap material while sellers sell items at a high price.However amazon do plenty of offers on normal everyday items and I've not had much issue when contacting them if I have problems.My only gripe would be that sometimes some items are sent out via other couriers such as Evri, DPD, Royal Mail etc, and I wish they would state on the order on the website that this chosen courier is delivering my parcel instead of an amazon courier.",1
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the shipment. Then they give you an approximate shipment date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day!

She said that the package would be at my home last night.   When it was not I contacted Amazon this morning and after waiting almost 20 min online to speak to a supervisor they transferred me to another rep and not a supervisor.  He then told me that I may have to wait until tomorrow to get my packages that were supposed to be delivered yesterday.

This is a good site. I have great experience with amazon.,2
Items from Amazon have always been great and on time. My review is for Amazon not sellers using Amazon platform,2
My book is not showing on Amazon.Com but is on Amazon.UK.  I have repeatedly messaged Amazon about this but none of their advisors read my emails correctly. I have tried to raise a formal complaint by asking for details of their procedure / contact but these requests have also been ignored.  I have been disgusted by Amazon’s failure to address these issues.,0
Admin thanks ,2
My experience with Amazon is great delivery is on point and there refunds are great too and you get your money back without sending the defective item back,2

"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2
Need to look into your seller's duty... They are packing very poorly..... Bad interaction,1
The delivery is good too.,2
I have bought a fair number of different items from Amazon from a television for the living room to much smaller items. Amazon sell just about everything you could want for the house or everyday use at a range of qualities and prices. The prices are normally very good prices,2
Its the best eCommerce business. I get to find items for half the cost and get to see other reviews before purchasing the item.,2
"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic items for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer assistance every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
"Recently, I have been having issues with my orders; receiving items that I did not order, receiving goodss that do not work (are defective), unable to return purchases, required to pay additional cost for goodss upon arrival, etc.  As a result, I have been spending too much time following up with Vendors, calling customer support, asking for refunds, and returning items; all defeating the purpose of online shopping.I believe that Amazon should spend more time in qualifying their Vendors.  Online shopping should be straight forward: 1) buy an item 2) receive the item ordered.Very disappointed.",1
"Never had a problem with Amazon before now but just got a message to say that my package is undeliverable due to damage and I'll get a refund,but if the package is damaged I would like the choice myself of inspecting the package and then rejecting it,I ordered demon screen de icer and how do I know that the driver has taken it and damaged the package themselves,won't be using Amazon again",0
"I love Amazon. They have a great range of products at competitive prices. They arent as cheap as ebay - but you have the Amazon guarantee which you dont with e-bay and thats worth paying a little more for the peace of mind.A tip is that its always worth checking out the Amazon price with free delivery before buying form someone else on Amazon, becasue although there prices may appear cheaper than Amazons, by the time you add on postage Amazon nearly always is cheaper.Customer service is superb. Why shop naywhere else?",2
Prices suck sometimes and shipping is awful unless you have prime.,1
Fast fast fast fast fast......tha nk you so much,2
"I have been an Amazon customer since the very beginning - in the UK, the US and now France. I think their service quality is astonishingly good. Living in rural France it is a lifesaver. Just recently I have had my first returns and they were handled quickly and without fuss - maybe thanks to my many, many orders over the years. I think they should pay far more tax and pay their employees way more money - and I'd be happy to pay an extra 15% if I was confident it was going to staff wages.",2
"Amazon works well if things are standard.  However, the moment an issue becomes non-standard, you enter customer assistance hell.  I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.",1
My most recent experience purchase no issue delivery on time. Discription size did not match on delivery posted message to seller no response left it a while WILL NOW CONTACT AMAZON SOON AS I GET CHANCE. I have left me with a sour experience as when orders are from Amazon directly there are no issues but 3rd party not so much will still shop with Amazon with a view to avoid 3rd party if possible.,2
Amazon has large selection of products and lowest price. I can find almost everything there. great experience,2
I am a regular customer with Amazon every delivery turns up on time and any issues I have customer service are very quick and helpful to resolve the issue ￼,2
"Don’t ever use Amazon.es! Faulty items that Amazon does not want to take responsibility for even though it was Amazon that sold and delivered it. I bought some baby items well in time for the baby’s arrival. I had a quick look to see if everything was there and it looked fine but obviously didn’t put it up including a travel cot/changer as I wasn’t due any time at that point, I got it early just in case as you never know when the baby decides to come. When I did get to put it all up, there was a clip missing to hold the changer up safely onto the cot, this is something I would t know was missing without the whole thing up and reading instructions etc. I contacted Amazon and they shrugged it off saying the policy is complain within 30 days. This isn’t realistic for this sinario but they didn’t want to know. I only wanted the missing item! I didn’t want a refund or a return, I just wanted the clip which I am unable to buy separately. They didn’t care and didn’t want to know!! It’s so black and white with Amazon and will use anything to avoid responsibility and to compensate a faulty item! I might as well paid a lot less for the same item as I am unable to use the other aspects. It’s now just a travel cot. I paid €110 for a travel cot!!! Don’t bother! Go to a shop or use a different online sight!",0
"I ordered a few items for a trip. The delivery date I was given (for 2 day because I’m a prime member) has come and gone twice.  My advice is if you need something by a specific date, don’t order from Amazon.",0
"We were given a voucher for over £200. We have tried ordering 2 tvs and a desk all at seperate times using our voucher. When complaining about it they first said the item was still coming and then weeks later said the item couldn’t be delivered. We asked for the money so we could spend it elsewhere and they said no, with no compensation. Essentially we have lost that money. If I had enough money or spare time I’d take legal proceedings.",0
i have used amazon on a number of occasions for costly electrical and gift items ranging in prices from 10 pound to over 200 pounds never had one problem would recommend amazon to anyone!!,2
"In general I try to support local shops as often as possible but you really can't beat Amazon's benefits - quick delivery, free returns, and have pretty much anything you could ever need. I only reduced 1 star as I do believe the fee to join Prime is more then needed.",2

I am a vivd purchaser on Amazon books and other hardware. The best price and shipping dont always seem to be in par with reality. Great selection but quality is not what I expect.,1
"Buyers be ware! I have been a customer of Amazon for years, and never thought I’d be a victim of their scam. I have returned a few items using QR codes, and have a receipt. UPS has matched all QR codes to the receipt, but Amazon says they have not received the products. $383.02 worth of my hard earned money. UPS advises to reach out to Amazon, Amazon claims to have not receive the items. My credit card company won’t refund the money, because Amazon claims they have not received the items. How were the items not scanned, but I have a receipt?   Is this how you’re making your money? Shame on you!!! You can close my account. I’ll take my poor coins elsewhere. Order#111-9096721-7785817",0
"I have been a customer of Amazon less then 2 years.  My concern is they do not deliver your packages to your unit door if you live in a condo.  They just throw them on the floor in your mailroom, if you have one.  They have no respect for the items they are delivering. They act like all they want to do is just get in and out of the building as quick as possible.  They can't compare with FedEx, UPS or even USPS delivery service.",0

"I had amazon prime for the longest time and it's the best thing that ever happened to me. Family comes second. Its so fast and cheap and they have EVERYTHING! Some days I just went to the website to shop w/o anything in mind, just seeing what fun cheap stuff I could find. Never ever had a problem with it. I only ordered from amazon itself tho, not any other supplyers. It is very bad if you are environmentally conscious tho. Too easy to buy shiet. So much shipping distance. But damn its fun.",2
"I have noticed  a decline in service from  Amazon shipping and billing.  2 days ago  I received an order that was completely,  like way off the mark, wrong.

I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve goodss with so-so quality,1

"Once upon a time, in the magical land of Amazon.com, I embarked on a quest to buy a variety of items and even sell some of my own. Little did I know that this journey would be filled with both laughter and bewilderment.As a buyer, my interaction has been mostly positive. Amazon's vast selection of goodss and speedy shipment make it a convenient choice for all your shopping needs. However, there have been times when I've encountered the occasional weirdness with returns. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and hopping on one foot.But fear not, dear reader, for I have discovered a hidden treasure! On rare occasions, I've managed to summon a human customer assistance representative. These elusive creatures are surprisingly pleasant and possess the power to make your problems disappear with a wave of their magical wand.Now, let's talk about the dark side of Amazon: the seller interaction. As a small business owner, I must warn you that Amazon is a greedy and ridiculous platform. It's like a dragon hoarding all the gold and leaving you with just a few measly coins. Their policies are designed to maximize their own profits, leaving sellers feeling like they're on a never-ending quest for fairness.To all aspiring merchants out there, I would advise you to tread carefully in the treacherous realm of Amazon. Offer your goodss on their platform to reach a wider audience, but don't put all your eggs in this basket. Instead, create your own enchanted website and offer your wares at a slightly lower price. It's like offering a secret discount to those who dare to venture beyond the Amazon kingdom.In conclusion, dear reader, Amazon.com is a land of contrasts. As a consumer, you'll likely have a acceptable interaction, but as a seller, be prepared for a wild and unpredictable journey. So, gather your courage, sharpen your wit, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",1
Yesterday I bought kids rubberband for 280 rs.The way the goods is showed in the image was satisfactory for me.But today when I got delivered it was too small.Not happy with the goods.Shining Diva fashion is the goods name ,1
"I am writing this only because I feel it needs to be said.  Amazon, I understand with Covid-19 shipments are delayed in shipping; however, please changed your page setting to not say ""if you order in 3 hrs and 15 min"" you have have your order the next day.  I am a prime member and pay my prime membership; however, I do base my orders on when I can receive them.  Telling people if you order in so many hours you can have your shipment by .... if is misleading and plain wrong.",1
most sellers are not decent. But when you find a seller they provide decent stuff those are decent. add more quality control please!!,1
"Weird that they can see what we type before sending it, then hurries you with your problem and ends chat without any say. Disappointed with their customer service.",0
"I would give a zero if I could. I have continued to receive food from Amazon Fresh. It continues to arrive at my home warm, thawed out and has to be tossed. Nothing to keep the food cold and fresh is placed in the bags. Today I ordered and again received bacon, chicken and more WARM. I’m beyond upset!!!! How can Amazon even get away with this. It’s a health hazard to say the least. It all had to be thrown out. And I was only given a $10 credit!!!!! Wow!!!",0
"The shopping usage on Amazon has been mostly positive, with a wide selection of goodss and convenient supports.  However, improvements are needed in packaging to prevent damage during transit.  Occasional order delays and inconsistencies in goods information should also be addressed.  Despite these areas for improvement, I appreciate the convenience and variety offered by Amazon.",1
I liked companies items.costmer assistances are acceptable.quality of clothes and other items are acceptable .All companies goodss are available here. I trust them.,1

"Took my 1900 euros and ignored me. I've purchased 2 gift cards each for 950 euros and used both of them to place orders. All the orders were canceled, then they suspended my gift cards and I received the email regarding it. I replied to the email with 2 invoices confirming the purchase of those gift cards. Then, I was contacting support agents almost every day to hear a single word saying ""Wait a little bit more"", ""Your case is under review"", etc. Moreover, they voided 1 of my gift cards for 950 euros. It has been 12 days since the problem occurred and no clear answers or responses.",0
"Signed up for prime ordered 6 items, 2 came next day, 2 weren't delivered and 2 I'm still waiting on.No refund, no apology, no help to contact amazon courier nothing. Cancelled membership and I'm going to the shops to buy stuff in future.",0
"I made an order online to buy some extension cables for my house.

"Again had an email saying packages have been handed to resident,  2 of us in all day.  Customer service says give it another 24 hours.  The point is it's says delivered.  Another waste of time and worse than poor service from Amazon",0
"Just sheer incompetence being displayed on the part of this organization and never wanting to take full responsibility for their actions, especially when it comes to making mistakes and then they have the gaul and nerve to accuse me of lying to them?! Here's what happened here and hoping these fools get exposed for what they are doing there and Bezos gets his head out of his butt and takes a further and strong look as to how his operation is being run there and whom he's hiring as customer service staff there, aka cheap labor from third world countries who can barely speak English or be able to formulate a sentence properly...here is what happened to me recently...I would like to voice a complaint against the biggest online retailer in the world, that being Amazon.com. So in a nutshell this past week, I ordered a Coke Zero mini fridge they were selling and there are two different designs to them, one has a bottle on it and the other has a full logo splurged horizontally across the door, and thinking I was finally going to receive the bottled version after two other attempts at getting this resulted in returning them both back for full refunds, a few leadership team members had promised and assured me I would finally be receiving the item that is pictured and when I received the item late last night at home (1/20/2024), I received yet the same item I received the other two times over and now having to return that as well. I have been in constant battles with their inept & incompetent customer service division & I have requested to speak to higher ups there to rectify this problem, but they have done nothing but lead me astray like a puppy dog, ignoring my requests and then accusing me of lying to them that I actually received the correct item when I did not & I showed them the two links in question, side to side and pinpointed this in as many ways as possible, but still, they refuse to do anything to help me out and I have just about had it with them. I truly feel they are practicing fraudulent and deceptive advertising at that website and I am at my wits end with them to boot! I do not appreciate being accused of something I didn't even do here and I could care less whether promotional credit was used or not on this item to cover said costs of the product, it was still the wrong item shipped out to me and nothing has been done to rectify this mess. I submitted further proof & evidence as they had requested to show them I was not making any of this stuff up and I never heard back from them, so I re-contacted them to no avail, so hoping this situation gets remedied this once & for all! They're oblivious to never wanting to admit they were at fault for anything but rather, blame the customers and now they're asking for solid proof too?! Well, they got it as this kind of chicanery needs to cease right here and now!All this over a mini fridge they're selling that has two different logos to it and when you order it from them, what is displayed versus what one actually does receive are literally quite different in so many ways and aspects, as it's beyond comprehension with them. Just a sad excuse for an organization to be doing any of this to their loyal and faithful customers.UPDATE on 1/23/2024 at 2 PM CT...Well, I have to give them credit where credit is due as it took a major interaction with their corporate team and CEO to get to the bottom of this craziness and I am happy to report that they came through with fixing this messed up and screwed up order and they even offered humblest apologies for accusing me of lying about everything associated with that order and what I received and such. I still would be very cautious about doing business with them, no matter how well known they are as their customer service division really needs a huge and major overall and to bring in people who can actually speak the English language properly and truly give a damn about helping their customers who keep that business afloat on a daily basis. Serious re-training of their staff needs to be done at once as they all seem in quite a bit of a hurry to conclude chat and phone conversations without properly delving into the key issues one might have with their orders. I'll change my rating to a 4 star review from one as they acted appropriately but again, thank goodness for getting in touch with their corporate division and CEO or I'd still be having issues with getting this nonsense solved to this very day, but it's now done and completed and let's hope they don't screw up any more of my orders from here on out. I can hope, right?!",2

"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a support provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after Prime prices were raised and goods prices are higher than in stores already. Amazon is now charging for returns also.  Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1

"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years. It used to be great and I loved it, I still do but there are more and more disappointments with almost every other order, it is going down the hill: it is already a norm for the packages to get lost, not to arrive on time, customer assistance is usually useless and not professional. I used to do most of my shopping through Amazon but I am trying to avoid ordering on Amazon now, I hope they will get it under control.",1
I will never be purchasing anything ever again from Amazon I will be moving my business to eBay you sent me the wrong sized cat tree I ordered the xxl tree got the large tree 2 different prices and won’t do anything to correct your mistake shame on you Amazon shame on your company I will be contacting the seller to let them know what kind of shady business Amazon runs and they might want to reconsider selling their products with you,0

I was told that after giving a month of my time on the kindle challenge that I would receive a $5 kindle credit. Unfortunately they didn't tell me I had to pay the taxes. Nice one Amazon. You've done it again. Screw over everyone and hopefully you will get it back in karma.,0
My Account got compromised as someone hacked  my account and I noticed it within a few hours since I was going to purchase a few items-I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident as money was withdrawn from my Amazon Gift Card and my Virtual card which I had on my account- which was gifted to me.-I have been calling everyday for the past 6 days and I get the same answer -we are investigating and will get back to you in 24hrs-but no response is ever received-so I suggest stay away from buying Amazon gift cards and using Virtual cards as there is no support from Amazon and the responsibility and risk is totally yours. Amazon is good as long as there are no complicated issue or Fraud-I even asked them if I could speak to the fraud Dept. but they said I could not. Not sure if they have a Fraud  deptt.,0

"I'm buying on Amazon from time to time. Once I bought birthday balloons. They were not cheap. However, one of the balls turned out to be a hole. The only way to get the refund was to send the balloons back, but the envelope was in the bin, so I did not have an address where to send it. And I also assume that sending them back will cost me more than balloons. I had to buy new balloons again, but in the store. Thus, I paid twice, and I felt that I was not protected in this case.",1
"I use Amazon a lot. If a package is lost or extremely late I get a refund, and if it ends up arriving I still get to keep it. I do pay for prime but I'm thinking about stopping it because they keep trying to force me into a ""shipping day"" once a week. What's the point in paying for prime then because orders are free over $25(I think... It might be $50) I might as well add to cart until I have that amount.",2
I have used Amazon since 1997 and never had any troubles. What more?,2
amazon is great but what get me mad is that IF YOU AIN'T IN THERE PROGRAM . you can't write no reviews or they band you from writing reviews. I am honest person and I show video/pictures of the goodss and still got band.,1

"I shop alot on amazon and i order shoes,slippers,boots etc but i notice when i do purchase a pair they are always ""irregular"" and nothing Like the description ,the you end up with a ordinary goods or spend a fortune on shipping when shipping was free to you.I think it should be illegal to sell anything like shoes especially irregular on amazon .",1
"Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on items (like baby items) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.  So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of items, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not. I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt decent for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon. The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.",1
"The very worst!  They sent me an email regarding recalled products and to contact customer service for a refund.  I contacted customer service and after over an hour of arguing with them, they said that I can't have a refund because the order is expired and it's to late.  Understand that by law they must refund recalled items. The product was purchased in August 2019 and the recall just came out on January 30, 2020 covering January 2013-November 2019.  This, by law, must be refunded, but no, they will let me return it with a restocking fee.  Yes, that is right, a restocking fee for a product that is recalled and they are going to restock it!!!!!!

I ordered a Hyundai lawn scarifier from Amazon and was told it would be delivered some time on the 10th of June but no definite time. I waited in all day then at 8pm I received an email saying it would not be delivered that day. A whole day of my life wasted for this garbage service and not the first time. I cancelled the order and bought a different but similar model from another on-line supplier. It arrived the next day as arranged. I have closed my account with Amazon. I have better things to do with my life than sit around waiting for this garbage service to keep failing!,0
"I cant understand why there are so many low scores for Amazon. Where else can you go and get same day delivery, on Prime and the items and packaging come in perfect condition. Such a range and always giving price comparisons. I know I can rely on them to deliver on time with no hastle. I can return items with no questions if I or they got it wrong. Its easier and cheaper than going to town for sure with more variety. I'm very pleased. this is not a one off experience, i have been shopping with them for years with many purchases.",2

"I am writing this review not in reference to any of the supplied goods from Amazon, which I have mostly always been happy with. Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.I appreciate the fact that when things went wrong that weren't even your fault, that you fixed them for me. Thanks.",2

Amazon does nothing to help of you have an issue with one of their third party sellers. They dont vet them and take no responsibility for counterfeit products sold thru their site. Do not ever purchase thru a third party seller. What rip off on an expensive item,0
"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
"Bought an item with next day delivery (Prime) and after no information on second day I called Customer Service. It's probably easier to get a bill through congress than to get to a human! Since it is a shipping problem they can't answer any questions. Not allowed access. Mid discussion I get an email that it will arrive tomorrow. It is coming from an Amazon facility 15 miles from my house and takes three days. When I ask what happened all I get is here is a discount on a future purchase and when transferred to a supervisor by the very courteous CS rep I get a very rude supervisor who informs me that she can't do anything about shipping. (Funny, I thought that the shipping was the number one value of Amazon.)",0

All Christmas shopping purchased online. Absolutely everything arrived when they said it would and in great condition. I allowed a bit of extra time for delays as I assumed it would be a bit hit and miss at this busy time of year but it wasn't needed! Great communication about it all too. Very happy shopper :),2
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
"I ordered Pixel 7 Pro 256 GB like a week ago. Yesterday, they blocked my account because they think someone else made this order for me. Of course, they also canceled this preorder. Now Pixel is out of stock and I can't get it anywhere. Thank you, Amazon. I will never order anything here.",0
Great website with good offers especially during prime days. More reliable and trustworthy than the likes of eBay.,2
amazon are not as average but things you get off them are cheap at times and not the right colour and at great standards and i wont not use this website alot as i ordered screen protectors off it and they were terrible and order charging case and look every cheap and did not charge,1
with anything i have bought from Amazon or their partners....,2
"Some of my orders have never arrived, from different shops and different items. It’s the fourth time in 2 months. I get an email saying that the parcel was delivered, and the status of my order says delivered, however I never received it. I tried a different address and the same happened. Amazon provided me with refund, but it’s being a hassle to buy a item I need and wait for it, when it doesn’t arrive I have to call them just to find out I will not get what I was expecting.",1
"Bought quite a few gadgets from Amazon. Cameras, Satnav, Kindle etc. Good price, quick delivery. Thats what I like...",2
"2 years ago my review of Amazon would have been complete opposite of the current one star I am giving it now. My reasons are as follows. Amazon in the last couple years has been dealing with a lot of Chinese sellers. With that being said -a lot of the things that I have purchased personally on Amazon have come in a different color as advertised or a different size or just completely cheaply bottom-of-the-barrel made. Secondly, in the past month alone I have received four items from Amazon that have been damaged to the point of having to be returned. Thirdly, I pre-ordered an item about 3 weeks ago that didn't show up on the day it was supposed to. For the following three days the tracking status showed that the item would be there that day. Yesterday when I went my orders part of my Amazon account this particular item in red writing stated ""approval needed"". I had to call Amazon to find out what was going on. The gentleman in broken English proceeded to tell me that I needed to call so they knew whether or not to still send the item to me because it was not received on the day it was supposed to. What they were doing was requiring me to call and approve the purchase that I had already made. If I would have not called within a certain amount of time they would have canceled the item all together and not sent it to me. This was a high -in demand item at the time I ordered it. I have a feeling that they sold more than they had in their inventory and are now screwing people over. Whether I receive this item or not is yet to be determined. But, at the end of the day this was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my two year old that she will now not receive this Christmas. I would also like to add that I base a lot of my purchases from Amazon on the reviews.  But I have noticed that when I look at the reviews they are not even for the item that I am looking at purchasing! For example, I was looking at a phone case for my phone and low and behold 80% of the reviews were for a bath mat or a trash can liner. How does a company like Amazon fail so miserably at this? How can you have 5000 reviews for a product and only a small percentage of those reviews are for the actual product you were looking at? The two-day shipping is also a bit of a joke. People pay for their Amazon membership based on the sole fact that they are guaranteed the product that they purchase within two days. I can say that a huge amount of my purchases have been delayed. So if you are guaranteed a 2-day shipping turn around, that is what it should be, two days. Not 5, not 6, and not over a week. I also have not been notified of a delay in shipping of my products until the actual day they are supposed to arrive! Then all the sudden when I look at my orders page it says that it has a new ""expected delivery date"".  Disappointed in Amazon to say the least. They're quality control needs severe attention. They also need to stop getting greedy like Walmart and dealing with all Chinese sellers. It seems as though everything is getting to their head as once happened to Walmart. Greedy, greedy, and more greedy. As of the first of the year of 2019 I will be canceling my Amazon Prime membership permanently. Sorry Amazon, you have lost mine and my family's business for the reasons stated above plus more that I won't mention to not make this review any longer than it already has been",0
Customer service very poor.I do not recommend shopping on this site .It's best not to do any business with this company....Search the internet it's best to buy straight from the producers.,0
What an insanely great website!!,2
"Always attentive, responsive and (if needed) compensative. I never like to pay extra for something for fast delivery that I can have a few days later under usual circumstances but I never regret being a Prime customer and paying the annual subscription fee. Amazon for the win! :)",2
"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer support at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1
"I am really disappointed with Amazon.  I have been a loyal customer for the last 6 years.  Have made several orders.  Once I ordered a laptop and the screen was broken.  I had no way of getting a refund.  They over charged me for orders for Sales tax and delivery during the pandemic, and now I'm locked out of my account. I tried calling customer service but they couldn't solve me issue. They never appreciated me as a loyal customer after all these years.  I think I'm done with them.  I have never felt so disappointed and abandoned.",0
"Used to LOVE Amazon but no longer a fan someone had gotten ahold of my Amazon prime information and keeps downloading movies n apps my CC has been hit for HUNDREDS of dollars in the last month there are about 4 charges I'm still waiting to be refunded and thank decentness the one I got hit for yesterday in the amount of $64 will be refunded. When asked what should I do to keep this from happening was first told to change my password did that went hm n was able to get right onto my prime without having to log in with new password next was told to remove CC did that but then started getting emails telling me to put one back on file or my acct will be closed...put a bogus one on then went in a WK later to place a order had to put my original cc back on to place my order less then a hour late more bogus charges on my acct. The CSRs don't speak proper English so IDT they understand what I'm asking when I say:"" what can I do to keep this from happening"" its getting really frustrating so I guess I'll jus be calling each time to get refunded when I have to put my original cc on file to place an order n get hit with charges I did not authorize. Can't wait until another company comes out similar...I will be RUNNING to them..",1
Great way to do business quick and easy,2
Amazon very very fine support number 6291783354//7462924659,1
I called for a missing order on an item and the customer service rep Marie found my problem got me a refund and authorized it in under 5 mins all while keeping a friendly attitude and keeping me updated. Made a stubbed toe feel like a massage :),2
"I would not suggest even for this one star, I don’t have an zero option and hence this star. Worst ever. They don’t deliver half of the products and say that we are responsible for the product even if it is not delivered. I have decided to stop shopping with amazon",0
"Amazon is  FREAKING AWESOME! Shipping is FAST, tons of stuff to choose from and I love the ""deal of the day"" ZERO complaints!",2
I love to shop at Amazon.com as regular basis because they are most efficient and best shopping place at online. I will hoghly recommend anyone to shop here. Their refund process at prime is hassle free. Excellent customer service and you can get thing so quick on time.mmost of all they are trustful online source. I am feeling good to be Prime member enjoying my shopping every time. I love Amazon service.,2
Can not be beaten on price for DVD's etc,2
Even if you have amazon prime package does not come fast I have been waiting since April nineth delivery date keeps changing for package tracking keeps saying same thing left same place two or three times. This saler is ridiculous 😒 giving amazon a bad name. 👎.  Im also waiting on another package its same thing delivery date keeps changing.I will start buying from temu. They give you 5 dollar discount if package is late. No shipping fee everyone should try temu love it. In fact I'm going to see if I can find this item on temu cancel from amazon. Also trust pilot tried adding photo. It won't let me maybe I'm doing it wrong hum!,0
I think considering Amazon is a multi-billion pound company they should give you an average time when your parcel will be delivered instead of having to wait in from 8 o'clock in the morning till 9 at night for your parcel to get delivered they say they can leave it somewhere but what if you don't have anywhere to leave it as it will get stolen I think it is ridiculous and they need to look into this matter to give people around about time your parcel will be getting delivered instead of having to hang around all day especially on a Day Like This with the sun is shining you don't get many they seem to be up to date with everything else so why not delivery times,0
"What an absolute waste of space of a company!! How in the world can Jeff bezos be one of the richest men in the world when his company is an absolute joke. Time and time again my parcels have not been delivered. The whole workforce is full of sausages and absolute morons with no respect for anyone and then they wonder why they're delivering boxes to people's doorsteps (supposedly), for a living. If I saw an amazon van in a head on collision I would only stop to laugh at them and reclaim my long lost parcels that seemed to fall off the face of the earth.",0
Customer assistance was unable to make a trade in for the newest Kendal fire. I bought in July of 2018.  They offered me 20.00 dollars for a just out of warranty goods. Because their was no option listed to trade it in on their website. This is horrible. Be aware of their policies before ever buying any electronics of any kind,1
"HORRENDOUS!! ABSOLUTELY THE WORST C/S I HAVE EVER SEEN IN 43 YEARS! DISGUSTING!! It is IMPOSSIBLE to talk to someone IN CLEAR ENGLISH, the same problem requires COUNTLESS attempts to address ONE SMALL PROBLEM it absolutely MIND BLOWING they can get away with this and STILL BE IN BUSINESS!! WOWWW!",0
I will always buy from Amazon because of their return policy. They have not trapped me into products because some manufacturer keep posting false advertising. I am also a Prime member and the value of the credit card outweighs the annual fee,2
"I have a love/hate relationship with Amazon. I order from them all the time, especially the last few years because it is easier than having to go out and search our local stores for particular items, that often times are not in stock or simply not available where I live. I have also often searched for other online stores to purchase items from but rarely do I find one where I can get free shipping and a lower price. So, though it pains me to do so, if I need to place an order for certain items, I shop on Amazon. That being said, the customer assistance I personally have received has been pretty awesome, the majority of the time. The key is NOT to buy from a third party seller, as that is a huge headache, in my own interaction. Also, you cannot write a review that directly complains about Amazon because they will not ""approve"" it. Which is ridiculous because we all know that Amazon has gone way downhill since the early days. However, that being said, it is possible to get a refund, make a return, and get your money back if you NEVER receive your package. It is a bit of a pain in the a** but it can be done be done. What it takes is patience, persistence, and knowing how to navigate the system. I recently was given a large gift card credit to spend simply because I had such an issue with shipping and it was days past the time my package should have arrived with an item that was an 1/8 of the price of the credit I was given. I used a gift card to purchase it, so I was happy with that. I am the person who manages to get my refunds AND I often get my items for free because I do NOT take NO for an answer. I am polite (for the most part), kind, calm and I do NOT give up. I have interactiond many problems with shipping, missing items, items delivered to the wrong apartment, poorly made items, poorly packaged items, items not arriving on time,etc.etc. And each time, customer assistance has taken care of me. Sometimes it takes more than one phone call and asking for a supervisor, explaining the situation over and over again, but in the end the result is in my favor. I actually fill out the survey the customer assistance agents email me after the phone call. I am honest and thorough when I fill them out and I praise those exceptional agents who go the extra mile for me, as I appreciate excellent assistance, as I have been in there shoes in the past. However, if I can find an alternative to shopping at Amazon that also offers free shipping and lower prices, I take it. I would love nothing more than to not have to order another item from them. Obviously, the company treats their employees like crap, the quality of many of their items is merde, they often price gouge, many of their reviews are bogus, the packages are usually not packaged properly or poorly packaged, returns have become a huge pain, many third party sellers rip people off, it can take longer to receive refunds and reviews have to be approved(utter.bullsh**.) Jeff Bezos is making money hand over first, while not paying the amount of taxes or any at all on the billions of dollars he has made and not caring one iota about his employees or his customers. This is what happens when we end up with monopolies and extremely few options available to us. My goal this year is to buy less, continue to search for other online businesses to shop from (especially local ones) and continue to vote, sign petitions and work towards changing the current status quo.",1
"Amazon has been decent to me normally, but they have their average parts as well. Like my last order was delivered to the wrong address and fortunately I have decent neighbors that put it on our mailboxes but I know not everyone is nice like them. This is not the first time it’s happened either, and a few times items were delayed for weeks before they said I would need to reorder! Not cool, but sometimes they offer little rebates but you have to really complain a lot to get them and they aren’t really worth it… all in all I’ll still be buying from them but the could really up their game being as big of a company as they are.",1
"Everything about Amazon has went downhill. Packaging is crap, especially for books! Everything arrives damaged. Shipping is horribly slow and Walmart has most items cheaper. Monthly charges for Prime are ridiculous when shipping is so late every time and Prime channel, music and so on has garbage for a selection. Netflix has better movies and tv selections. Amazon sold out and has went in the toilet as their stock declines show.",0
"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was decent timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer support, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your support is no longer acceptable.",1
I do not have words to explain how excellent Amazon is.,2
Can never fault the fast delivery and selection of products available. Great service and the customer service is outstanding.,2
They are horrible now. As prime member I should get 2 days free shipping and Items arrive late then told me to wait another 7 days for the item. They also promised me I will get a refund as credits on one of my item cuz the unworking promotion code. They told me to put the order so I can get the refund which I did and I never receive the refund. Just a few days later they also promised me I will get $5 credit for the delay which never received again....I just dont get it anymore. They used to be so much better.,0
"I've been a customer for a long time, and I will probably keep ordering from them - but not as much as before.For the first time, I wanted to find just items made in the USA.  I want to order some shallow bowls, like pasta bowls - and I don't ever by any dishware made in China.  I heard stories a long time ago that they aren't as careful in regulating the dyes & other ingredients used in dinnerware.  We've all heard about the poisoned dog food from China that killed a few people's dogs.  And the worst was the tainted baby formula that killed Chinese babies.  If they don't care enough to protect their OWN children, then you know they aren't checking too carefully.  I see no way to reliably search for items Made in the USA.  I did find what claimed to be a ""Made in the USA"" section.  Then I typed in dinnerware, and it returned the same dishware that I already knew to be made in China.  Sweese was a brand that came up in Made in America.  And it is clearly Made in China.  And it's so time-consuming.  You have to drill down to the ratings, then search questions to find the info.  After 10 tries in a row with zero results from the USA, I gave up and headed over to WALMART where I was easily able to find what I needed.",1
Admin thanks ,2
I am a regular user and find the site easy to use - and more importantly the companies advertising always deliver against their promise,2
This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0
I order all the time off Amazon. Sometimes they get my address correctly. Sometimes they don't. I'm fed up with it. It's happening most weeks now. And I've put a special instruction where my address is. Grrrrrrr 😣,1

I will be a customer for life. Really love their commitment to offering the best value and customer service out there.,2
Normally I have no issue with Amazon. Sellers have been good. Fast shipping. But my last order. They have processed and cancelled the payment over 9 times. Spoke to Amazon they are less then helpful. Telling me it will go back in my account 5-10 days. Luckily my bank is great and issues me back the over charges leaving one pending to clear. But then the next day they put in 4 more. That makes my car insurance payment bounce. Go to the bank put in money to clear that payment. Bank again gives me my money back leaving one pending. This morning I wake up to 3 charges. Wft is wrong with Amazon. All you need is ONE authorization. Not 9. That’s over 1400.00 you have pending for a 164 payment. And there remedy is to offer a 10.00 Amazon GC. Really?!?!  Do better Amazon the worst customer service there is!!!!!!,0

"While somethings are acceptable on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their shipment drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything ordinary they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1
"Excellent pricing, excellent service and quality.",2
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the goodss supplied. It's Amazons own order support that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1

"I've been shopping at Amazon for quite a while now and they are one of my go-to places online. I usually shop here when the things I'm looking for aren't available locally or when they have the item(s) at a lower price than local sellers.I have lost parcels before (God damn porch pirates) throughout the years, and (their) customer service was always swift at either sending me a replacement for stolen delivery or payment refund - and they got these transactions done for me within 5 business days.I rarely purchase from 3rd party merchants on Amazon but when I did, I made sure the sellers have very high rating and trusted by people who have purchased from them. Otherwise, I usually purchase straight from Amazon's warehouse goods.No complaints here; 5/5",2
Very Good company,2
Amazon is the best retailer ever! One can find all types of products at the lowest possible prices. I've located products on Amazon that I've purchased in other countries easily. Service is quick and reliable. Returns are promptly processed. I love Amazon!,2
"Made an order on 20th December for a relatively expensive productEst arrival is 3rd-8th JanReceive email from Amazon 28 Dec that seller has not confirmed the dispatch of this order, and we are unable to provide you with dispatch details yet.Requested confirmation through Amazon platform to seller on 30 Dec for invoice, confirmation of dispatch or order or something.Another message is sent to seller on 2nd Jan as there was no response from initial inquiry.Contacted Amazon live chat on 3rd Jan for help as still no response from seller.Amazon tells me they can't do anything except send another email to the seller and that they have until the 8th Jan to dispatch the order.Technically if they don't respond i have to wait an additional 3 further days from the 8th to apply for a refund which will take an additional 5-7 days.I was given £5 amazon credit for any inconveniences, here's the kicker though - it only applies on amazon products only.Can't tell if amazon just wanted to troll me for xmas and new years 2020.FYI this was for amazon.co.uk",0
I had a problem with a purchase from sumup on amazon. After purchasing their debit/ credit card reader. It didn't read all of the card right. Their customer service was poor. And they were slow to pay. Also they were having problems with depositing money into my account. Before I had a chance to try and fix this problem after getting an email telling me about the bank problem on what's my end of business week I received another email on the beginning of the next business week telling me they wouldn't be doing business with me. Ok I looked into getting a refund. Amazons purchase page said it was too late. So I went to sumup. WOW now there was a big problem. I obviously didn't mean anything to them. After the frustration of trying to get a refund from Sumup and not getting satisfaction I contacted Amazon. The next day I had a full refund! Now I don't have to waste anymore time with Sumup Thankyou Amazon,2
I don't understand how I buy an item from you then you tell me you bought it from a 3rd party there's nothing I can do to help you!!!! WOW!!! That's crazy to me. Amazon you lost me today!!!!,1
This Company is money gougers. They keep charging me PRIME. They take money out of my Checking ACC without asking me or even telling me. I just get a bank statement and the money was drawn out. I have called twice each year for the past 3 years. I am done stop my account buy through E-Bay or Greg's list only.,0
"They have employees coughing in our packages with Covid and putting harmful products in the things they sell. Then after giving you something not safe knowing kids will be using this they’ll cut off your ability to review the things and voice what’s going on within their company using a message saying “unusual reviewing activity” I’ve never left anything but good reviews wth is an unusual reviewing activity lol something sketchy is going on with them. Don’t expect to ever hear back from anyone and if you return a package you’re not getting your money back. Oh let me not forgot if you get amazon prime make sure one card is put in your account they’ve charged all 4 of my cards and 2 of my husbands for the same subscription everytime then act stupid when you bring it up well you just paid for this today well why is every card charged? Literally have about 4 subscriptions I should be paying a month instead I pay about 40 times a month for stupid little stuff but they are absolutely no help and the people you get on the computer are rude and unhelpful they are probably eating food and picking their a**hole while talking to you because they get absolutely nothing done. Stay away from amazon. The only reaponse I got to asking them to fix my account is I’m sending it to someone they are higher up they’ll have it fixed within 24 hours did that 5 days in a row now and their reaponse is first I just want to thank you for being with us since may 2010 like yea I regret it!! You guys are horrible they don’t want you to truthfully review anything so you’re probably getting garbage if you go off reviews they post their own reviews and block ours, they hack your cards, they don’t deliver anything on time! And absolutely no customer service they literally talk to you like your an enemy in a club so unprofessional and weird.",0

"Monday 20th December I ordered £525 worth of Amazon Vouchers as a thank you to our volunteers with varying amounts. I received a confirmation email at 12:40pm. At 14:36 I received an email from an Amazon email address I did not recognise and it did not address me by name but said ""Hello"". It also asked me to change my password. I thought this might be a phishing email so I called Amazon to check. They confirmed that this was a genuine email and Amazon had deemed my order as fraudulent.I changed my password only to find that my order had been deleted and along with my card details.I have called Amazon at least 8 times and each time they have read from a script apologising and saying this will be escalated.I purchased from Love2Shop with no problems. I have been an Amazon customer for ages, with Amazon Prime as well.The reason I chose e-vouchers was for the very reason they could be sent electronically!For a huge company like Amazon they could have put a hold on the purchase until they investigated and then removed the hold. As of this moment although they have cancelled my order they have a hold on the monies which shows pending in my account.What would I suggest avoid Amazon e-vouchers if you are purchasing more than one.Customer Service is non existent. Poor, poor service.",0
I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1
"My parcel was lost. As I spoke to Amazon Customer service, they sent replacement and confirmed I don't have to pay again. After some time, I received reminder to return the order, otherwise they will charge me again. I checked with Amazon Customer service, they assured me I will not be charged. One day, I was charged over $240+ and as I did not remember this, I thought this was a fraud and called to suspend my credit card. As I recalled about this, Amazon Customer support apologized and refunded. However, as I was using foreign credit card, I had to pay $12 due to the currency buy in/out rate difference. As I complained to Amazon support, they only agreed to give me a voucher that can only buy Amazon brand products which is useless to me.",0
I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day shipment and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1
"While somethings are acceptable on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their shipment drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything ordinary they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1
Reckless delivery drivers driving at high speed through a built up residential area with children around. After waiting on the line for half an hour they stated that ‘as I don’t have an Amazon account’ I would need to contact the police instead. What has an Amazon account got to do with a reckless Amazon driver. What will it take for a young child to be killed!! I have two kids myself and don’t appreciate or tolerate this kind of recklessness from either Amazon drivers or Amazon themselves. Shame on you Amazon what a sad excuse not to look into reckless driving in a built up residential area,0
"Amazon... One of the biggest companies out there... You all seriously don't have an option to upload credit card information manually every time you purchase? I'm forced to upload my card and have it saved there until removed? What if my kids get into my account and decides to buy everything as far as the eye can see? I wouldn't be able to stop it considering my card information is saved and all they have to do is click ""continue""... I just purchased a laptop and apparently I still had my old card uploaded there from a purchase I did years ago WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. Thank God It was a Credit card and according to Tamara I was able to change the payment method to my new card before Amazon charged my old card. Or else there would of been a big problem. Won't be purchasing anything off of Amazon again until you all change the option to purchase something without having to upload and save your card information. How unsecure...",0
Most of the time I no problem with ordering from Amazon.  But I have noticed that if you do not write a favorable review when you are requested to write a review they will come back and say they cannot use it for some reason or another.  How is this honest reviews if you are going to cherry pick which ones you are going to use?  That is not a honest review of the product or how it was delivered.,0
"They have products delivered via UPS. The last two times, UPS claims delivery and location but it takes another two to four for the delivery to show up.  There is no way to contact Amazon, just their automated chat. Also no way to ask for USPS delivery only.  Walmart here I come.",0
Product fitment/description  is garbage and trying to get money back to reorder undamaged/correct product takes forever. Then you pay for prime for 2 day and everything still takes a week or longer.trying to actually contact a person is almost impossible Ebay is faster and better customer service,0
"Amazon allows me to peruse the web without going all over the place. It has provided a reliable, no hassle shopping experience that I greatly appreciate.",2
"I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on goodss on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive interactions with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.",1
"Delayed shipment , Classic Amazon smh...",1
"Honestly one of my favorites sites for shopping. Its conveinet, quick delivery and prices are similar or even cheaper than in stores. My biggest problem is that I just wanna leave the house less and less since everything can be ordered off of amazon. Their customer service was also speedy and quick to respond and refund me after an order was not the same as the listing. Overall I use amazon almost everyday for purchases from clothes, shoes, books, and household products.",2
"I have been a customer of Amazon less then 2 years.  My concern is they do not deliver your packages to your unit door if you live in a condo.  They just throw them on the floor in your mailroom, if you have one.  They have no respect for the items they are delivering. They act like all they want to do is just get in and out of the building as quick as possible.  They can't compare with FedEx, UPS or even USPS delivery service.",0
"My biggest problem with amazon is the fail gurantee deliveries. There is no section for a customer to complaint about a bad delivery. And if you cancel the delivery, they .make it look like the customer refuse the delivery.",0
"It's time to explore other ecommerce options. Amazon is too big and too inconsiderate to address simple issues even for its Prime members with Amazon cards. My story: (multiple cases) every delivery was riddled with issues, the most recent and disturbing - the delivery person handed my package to someone else with a different name and a different address and marked it as delivered. Now Amazon would like to me to wait for the next day to call back and began an investigation.",0

I wasn't the happiest about the shipping because the seller never gave a tracking # or confirmation of shipping, so I had no idea why it was taking so long to just ship out one little purse then all of a sudden came in the mail one day. I hate that because we have had issues with carriers delivering to wrong address! If I can't see I'm supposed to be getting it how will I know if it got shipped somewhere else or if I'm still waiting!I can't imagine why they don't want to post it!

Well what can you say amazon driver hits my car he admits liability but amazon turn my claim down as they say there is not enough EVIDENCE its like dr cripin admitting to 8 murders but the judge saying case dissmissed as there is no evidence the sooner people stop buying from this company the better,0
"Excellent always on point! Delivery, time frame, the best service. 10 Stars.",2
I recently ordered items on the 10th that were supposed to be delivered the next day the 11th. I paid extra $$$ just so I could get the delivery done within 24 hours. The delivery didn’t come through and when I contacted customer service they promised that I should be able to get them the next day which was yesterday the 12th. Nothing came through. I called them again and informed them the it was 2 days later and I still haven’t received my items. I needed them on the 11 and now it’s too late. They didn’t offer any help or even the courtesy of having a good customer service feedback. I checked online and it now it says delivery delayed until 13th-15th. Very disappointed even more. I asked them to cancel my order and to make it worse they said I will not be able to get my refund until 3-5 business days. Why would they charge for items that never got delivered? Amazon is getting worse and worse.,0
Amazon have lost 3 of my orders in the last 30 days. I give up!,0
"Amazon is a really great company however, Amazon Prime can be annoying, when it says next day delivery, this sometimes means you will get it in a couple of days.  Amazon do have a 2 hour delivery spot which is amazing for a £20 purchase. Apart from that, it is very good for bargains and has a massive range of products anything you can imagine.  I spend most of my time on Amazon don't really bother with other sites.  If I have ever had any problems they seem to resolve it very quickly.  I would of gave them a 5 star review but unfortunately sometimes I've been waiting days for my parcels.",2
If I could give 0 stars I would. Waited in all day to be told at 16.00 delivery would not be coming.  Cancelled it and requested a refund. 2 weeks later still no refund so finally managed to speak to them.  They have now processed my refund so will be another week at least.  Avoid at all costs.,0
Amazon only allows reviews that make them look good. If a vendor is absolutely terrible send you complete junk and then screws you over don't bother mentioning it because you will be blocked. Amazon will never let you give a negative review even if it allows you to give one star reviews you have to be a lawyer to make sure that you don't overstep their lines which are many many pages long by the way. It's impossible to leave a bad review without somehow running a foul of their ridiculous list of rules which include things like not complaining about the horrible customer service you get from a particular vendor or the horrible quality of something you get from a vendor none of those things are allowed. You can only say nice things regardless of the number of stars you give. They are a bunch of scum and after spending tens of thousands of dollars on their website they have blocked me for warning people against  Biologically dangerous crap that some of these people sell on these websites disguised as supplements. Amazon would much rather see you die from a bad supplement than let you see a bad review. Since all of their products originated in China I would recommend shopping absolutely anywhere else. Never forget all those babies cheap Chinese capitalists killed by putting melamine in baby formula. They do the same thing with everything else they send us and I have gotten so much crap from Amazon I have to say it is totally not worth spending any money on that website because it is all cheap junk. At least if you go to Walmart you can look at the Chinese junk before you buy it. ,0
"I have to give a star there is no option not to give a star.Do Not Sign Up for a Amazon Credit card Dispite the so called rewards You Will be Scammed and pay for things you have not ordered or bought. There Answer is to call the company in Question even when you had not purchased anything from the company. Due to the lack of intrest I cancelled my card. Unfortunatley I requested a refund for a item bought on a Amazon card which I had cancelled. So we reinvented the wheel again, Amazon card company would not pass me through there security check, so back to Amazon, who said they would put me through to the Amazon card company, So basically you are stuffed in a loop now one will give you a phone number or arrange for someone to call you back. So steer clear of this card for your own health and wallet. if you want my contact details I am not shy I dont know the rules but its stourbridge kev on facebook.",0
"I have used Amazon for many years and customer service has always been top of the line. I have always reveived my products as promised.

Amazon prime and audible is equally good.I strongly rekommend Amazon",2
"Ordered a package that said it was fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for prime shipping.... then it gave me some stupid 2 week away window..... They shipped through this absolute joke of a company called landmark global (if you search for them you find nothing but poor reviews on this scumbag cancerous operation).... they shipped within 2 days to New York (I am in Alberta Canada) then it sat there for 2 weeks! suffice to say they blew right through their ""window"" I called Amazon to see what the hell was going on as I needed the goods ordered.... both agents were less than useful and hard to understand, they told me to wait another week!, finally after 4 days it updated that it has shipped to ontario and god knows how much longer it will be.... I order a lot of stuff through amazon so this disaster of an experience is making me second guess that decision, not impressed at all. what a joke.",0
I like the convenience of it but my deliveries are constantly being delayed.,1
"I ordered a box of malteaser truffles from amazon and i just want to say it was great! Fast delivery, good price and the product was perfect and delicous",2
Awesome👏 ecommerce Platform for all types of products.,2
"Received my item in the poorest state I’ve ever received in item in - product, box the product came in and the shipping box all broken and crushed. I contacted customer support and explained that I purchased it as a Father’s Day present and couldn’t afford to wait for a time to return myself and then wait for the refund to buy a new present. I also explained that my dad is in hospital and I was going to surprise him with the gift. Customer support was unsympathetic and condescending. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and got through to Omkar. Total waste of time. Not only did he just recycle the same washed out responses I’d already received (clearly copy and paste), he was unhelpful and condescending to my situation. Telling me “we will investigate this issue to make sure it doesn’t happen again”, how does that help in this particular situation? Baffled if I’m honest. Won’t be ordering again as the customer service and delivery is awful.",0
"I'm disappointed that my books aren't up at sights Amazon said they would be for sale at. However, my project manager, Amy is beyond awesome.

If I don't understand something she is gentle to explain.",1

"I was shocked! You aren’t able to write a negative review on purchases.  I had trouble with a purchase and titled my review...”buy at your own risk”.  I said that “I ordered an item the 1st part of July and after 3 weeks I contacted the seller to say it hadn’t been received and was told it was shipped, but never got any other communication  from the seller after that.”  Amazon said I couldn’t post a review like that.  I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.",1
"They should get rid of Logistics for deliveries but they don’t do anything about it. I’ve been a prime member for years! I Was supposed to receive a package today but it was never out for delivery! Chatted with a Rachelle M which has terrible customer service by the way and she went and switched it to the next day delivery “per customer’s request” which I never requested! They lie and don’t even care!!!  Amazon Logistics is probably based on lazy people! One time I was waiting for my delivery and I was the next delivery however I noticed the driver turned the opposite way and minutes later, my delivery info was updated saying they could not deliver because package was damaged!!! My parcel was a rubber bath mat!!!!!!  Really????",0
It was an Excellent service. I ordered some things but they were delivered carefully and on time!,2
Pretty reliable but prefer boutique shopping.,1
"I don’t know where I can address this but I am normally very pleased with your assistances. However, today I noticed a shadow in my entry way and went to investigate. One of your drivers was parked in front of my house. As I was about to turn around I noticed your driver reach up and drop something out the window. The wind was blowing and blew his trash into sight. I know you don’t have control over everything people do. However, maybe education on not littering and trashing up property people work hard to keep pleasant might help.",1

"Awful experience - brought a phone for my elderly mother, it didn’t work. Was told to return to the repair department. I’ve been waiting weeks. No update, no response, customer service or repairs have not been coming back to me. Completely ignored. Phone was needed as a lifeline for my mother. Don’t buy a phone off Amazon. Go to a phone shop so you have some come back.",0
I had my ups and downs with Amazon but at the end of the day I still use them.  You can't beat the selection of merchandise or the customer service.  GOOGLE should take a lesson from AMAZON.,2
Customer support was unable to make a trade in for the newest Kendal fire. I bought in July of 2018.  They offered me 20.00 dollars for a just out of warranty item. Because their was no option listed to trade it in on their website. This is horrible. Be aware of their policies before ever buying any electronics of any kind,1
I have ordered with Amazon around 40 times always a good experience!!,2
Happy though still some problems in it. Nowadays make delay for item shipment,1
I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a goods. Dont appreciate the attitude.,1
"i decided to stop to buy there because of 3 purchase that i make and no item no money back and no reply from them, and every time i want to put a average review do not get posted posted",1
Absolutely love the company.  Shipping is fast 1-2 days ….but I do have a prime account…. Well worth it. Customer service picks up a phone and is A1,2
"I am consistently astounded at how good amazon is and it is now where I do most of my shopping for almost anything. The product reviews help me decide between multiple similar items and the price is always competitive.  Also, if I have any problems, I know that as I bought through Amazon, I have the piece of mind they they will sort it out, even if bought through a third-party.",2
great service.,2
Amazon has become my Goto place for all purchases now. Just make sure you look around for Prices and Reviews before you purchase.,2

Amazon let someone breach my account and change my number and passcode. Now they’re sending me threatening emails that if I can’t provide the credit card number associated with my account they’re closing my account!How can I provide this card that o clearly don’t have anymore because my bank account was also breached and I sent information to validate this.

No complaints.,2
"I'm buying on Amazon from time to time. Once I bought birthday balloons. They were not cheap. However, one of the balls turned out to be a hole. The only way to get the refund was to send the balloons back, but the envelope was in the bin, so I did not have an address where to send it. And I also assume that sending them back will cost me more than balloons. I had to buy new balloons again, but in the store. Thus, I paid twice, and I felt that I was not protected in this case.",1
I just had an amazing experience with Rosalyn. I had a mirror that was damaged and I no longer had the box that it came in. She refunded me regardless even though I couldn’t send it back in the box because it was delivered cracked to me. Great experience and I will most certainly keep ordering through amazon. Thanks Rosalyn!,2
"They can update a website, filter category is not helpful",1
Amazon in se è top ma la sua assistente clienti fa pena è davvero una vergogna,1
I don’t like Amazon because they advertise things for sale that are out of stock. I had a very bad experience just over a year ago when I bought a book. Like many people I ticked free postage.BEWARE! If you click Free Postage you will inadvertently sign up for Amazon Prime.I did not know I had done this until I had to change my bank card because of a security scare. I then had a phone call from Amazon saying they could not process my Amazon payments. I was horrified and thought it was a scam. I then rang the real Amazon and they told me I had signed up to Amazon Prime. I was appalled and cancelled my Amazon Prime account.I gave the card number of the expired card which was safe to do.  I then received a phone call from BT saying my call to Amazon had cost £80.BT refunded half of this as a goodwill gesture. Beware of signing up to Amazon Prime if you click Free postage. I lost several payments of £7.99 and £40 so lost about £80. Disgusting company who are conning and tricking people into signing up for Amazon Prime. I tried to download a kindle app the other day but discovered I could only use the app to read a book if I buy the book off Amazon. No chance!Other thing I hate about them: you can’t use PayPal.,0

Yet again another purchase through amazon for delivery 3rd or 4th... by yodelAnd surprise surprise delivery running late now 5th to the 9th .Cancelled my amazon prime account because what's the point if its coming viaYODEL it's aways late or doesn't ever arrive .. very poor again Amazon Very poor .. another customer your going to loose.,0
I haven't used this website for shopping for a long time. I often bought things on it when I was in school.,1
"I am writing both as a user of their products and also someone who has more than an inkling of ""how to be a professional seller"".   Amazon has never not met my needs. Always professional, always there. Especially helpful to seniors and avid reader and authors.  Definitely from my involvement with Amazon it is a 5 star Company!",2
"I absolutely agree with every single terrible review. The absolute worst customer service. They continuously transfer you to another rep because they don't want to get the bad survey whether you contacted them via phone or chat. The supervisors & managers are a joke as well. No one follows through, they lie constantly to YES get you off of the phone, & straight up don't give a fu**. Like I said the worst ever! NO COMMON SENSE! I would never treat my customers this way.*Maybe Amazon should stop getting cheap labor in other countries. They can do much better overall for their customers & afford better staff.",0
Used to be poor service and couldn't care less attitude but they've totally turned themselves around and are now THE place to shop online.,2
Amazon very very fine support number 6291783354//7462924659,1
"I've been shopping at Amazon for quite a while now and they are one of my go-to places online. I usually shop here when the things I'm looking for aren't available locally or when they have the item(s) at a lower price than local sellers.I have lost parcels before (God damn porch pirates) throughout the years, and (their) customer service was always swift at either sending me a replacement for stolen delivery or payment refund - and they got these transactions done for me within 5 business days.I rarely purchase from 3rd party merchants on Amazon but when I did, I made sure the sellers have very high rating and trusted by people who have purchased from them. Otherwise, I usually purchase straight from Amazon's warehouse goods.No complaints here; 5/5",2
"Amazon has been slipping for a while. Their shipping has been getting longer and longer. They will tell you at check out when the item(s) will be delivered and the item(s) arrive a week later. Being a Prime member at one time had benefits, now its becoming a nice cash cow for Amazon without providing what was, top notch support and order. One day, about 4 years ago, I orderd an item from Amazon and it actually arrived the same day! I was sold on Amazon, now I can take 20 minutes of my time and go to Walmart, pay less and have the item in my hand when i leave the store. This is what happens when a company get too big for itself.",1

Useless ..... absolutely useless,0
"Really good place to order from, trustworthy and reliable. good quality items, my go-to for buying things online.",2
Worst usage on online shopping ever!! Amazon can’t keep track on what their sellers mail to their buyers. I ordered the MPow headphones (red color) and instead received a black/neon green pair of headphones made by Yuanguo. I tried to get my money back and instead their costumer supports negotiated with me to resend a replacement and Amazon costumer supports guaranteed that this time I would receive what I bought. The replacement arrived and now I’m stuck with 4 pairs on earbuds I never ordered. I’m very upset and would like to be sent the item that I actually ordered. I will never buy anything with amazon again. Amazon needs to wake up for that and keep a better track on what’s being send by the sellers.,1
"Ordered an item that cost $317 compared to the MSRP of $449. Received the order quickly, but because somebody at the warehouse put the correct stock label on the wrong product I was sent an item that was completely wrong and with a price point $165 less than what I ordered. Customer service has been an absolute nightmare trying to get the return set up. First I had to e-mail photos of the packaging and everything else to which their reply was that it was invalid and I had to re-submit the exact same thing all over again. Finally got the approval for a return. Second they tell me they can't replace the incorrect item with the correct one and that I would have to get a refund and try ordering again. Then they couldn't send me the correct e-mail with the correct return shipping labels for me to print to apply to the return box. It took 8 different emails to finally get the right link to print the proper labels. Sent the item back by USPS with a tracking number on 6/27 and it was delivered on 6/29. The return center took 4 days until 7/3 to finally acknowledge it as received and it would take 2-3 days to process the refund and another 2-3 for the refund to appear back on my card.It's now been nearly two weeks and I still haven't gotten my refund. Call to find out what is going on and I'm told that I can't get refunded until I send back the correct item. Because of their moronic mistake of putting the correct stock label on the incorrect item their system shows that I received the correct item. It was shown with photographic proof in the initial return photos that the label with the correct item name/number was literally 3 inches away from the incorrect name/number on the product box it was placed on, but they're too incompetent to get that through their heads. I can't return what I never received. Now it's just one big runaround to get these scumbags to give me my money back. These incompetent morons will never get another dime from me after this ridiculous hassle over a simple return of their stupid mistake.",0
"Amazon is a great company with alot small problems, specially when it comes to vaguely answered customer support questions and those people have very limited power to help you with.And my most hated thing is the order status there should be more information and it should be more accurate.Other than that am happy with Amazon.",1
There is no follow through in times of delivery I have specified times the office is open.  Amazon continues to deliver after hours.  Therefore I miss the delivery and they say they'll try again the next day and it happens the same way.  Being that I am a Prime customer paid $140.00 for my membership I expect better service.  It is very frustrating I call and they tell me one thing and I get nothing.  I am so disappointed in their delivery and they don't care about the way the package is delivered.  What is happening with Amazon?  It's not worth the wait or the time I take out of my day to stay on the phone with these people.  Maybe it's time to do my shopping elsewhere.  I hope this helps someone out there.,0
"I shop alot on amazon and i order shoes,slippers,boots etc but i notice when i do purchase a pair they are always ""irregular"" and nothing Like the description ,the you end up with a average item or spend a fortune on shipping when shipping was free to you.I think it should be illegal to sell anything like shoes especially irregular on amazon .",1
"this company sank to a disgusting low. deceptive company practices, absolutely horrendous customer support. i would like to mention that i remember a time when amazon had some of the best customer support you'd find. that is far from the case now. no point at all contacting their support. if you have any issues just return your item, and try not to purchase it on amazon to begin with",0
"Delivery time is ok, but the quality is going down and down with each passing day! Please do the pick up soon and exchange!",1
"Amazon books orders. Mostly acceptable assistance from Amazon. However, oftentimes you get slightly dog eared edges to your ordered new book corners. This seems to be quite common showing lack of care in their handling of the books prior to or during picking or packing out of the order. This is slightly annoying. Overall order is decent. Selection of US published book titles very decent. Better probably than Waterstones or Book Depository too. Ordered were Krav Maga manuals titles and instructional all region DVD. I also benefited from a free offer one per customer of five pounds off my books order.",1
I am really surprised to see all of the negative reviews here. I am a very frequent customer and always receive great service. I just ordered a game we wanted quickly and it was here in less than 24 hours. I rarely have an issue with any orders and when I do it is on the vendor. I don't see how anyone cannot love Amazon.,2
"No matter what I need, or the desire of my heart, I can typically find it at a great price on Amazon. I love the addition of Prime Shipping, and love that I can receive my orders within two days of ordering! I've purchased hundreds of items across a myriad of departments on Amazon, and have never EVER had an issue with returning an item that didn't fit or was not as described. I'm so grateful for Amazon, and recommend my friends and family to shop on Amazon for all their online shopping needs. Years ago, I used to shop on eBay, and found that the whole auction thing was actually kind of fun. However, I ended up having issues with fraud in my PayPal account, and realized that this would continue so long as I was forced to use a middleman to complete my online purchases. With Amazon, there is no middleman and never has been any fraud in my debit account that can be traced back to an Amazon purchase. They're very protective of their customers' financial information, and refunds are quick and easy. I will never, EVER shop eBay again, especially in light of how many scammers are starting to infest eBay's sellers market. It's really too bad that eBay doesn't do as good a job at protecting their customers as Amazon does. Thank you Amazon for being so awesome!",2
"Amazon simply has everything, always good prices, fast delivery and always quick and easy to use.",2
I find amazon is no longer as great when it first started blooming. Packages don't arrive at all or don't arrive withing the prime time. Just no longer a big fan.,1
I'm very disappointed because you do not have the same items on all your websited. Why do you have a item on .com website and not on .be website? ,1
"Good to see the reviews here are telling the story....1* ...ishBought lights, via the dreaded platform that I had noted the younger generations really, really do not approve of...They didn't refund me for the no -show delivery.

"I've always wanted to purchase things from Amazon, since they have a variety of items and brands that I love but the most annoying thing is, they will never deliver items to my country. Only to my neighbouring countries OR when the item is available to my country, it is out of stock. But after reading everyone's reviews on Amazon and here, I think I should be thankful that I couldn't purchase anything from this website, considering how they actually accept used and returned products and then sent it out to other customers. I've seen way too many reviews mentioning that. The chances of me getting a used item is high, so no way I'm gonna purchase stuff from Amazon. And some of the sellers would actually sell fake stuff too, so nope. I ain't gonna patron Amazon.",0
Amazon has the best customer service ever!!!,2
They’re always reliable for sure the only times I had any troubles with them was the delivery by Amazon which for whatever reason lost a package of mine. Other than that I’ve never had a problem,2
"Would you please fix your search engine?  Perhaps Google could help.  When I search for an ""RTX 3080"" the booleans mean that my search should not display RTC 3090's, 3070's, 3060's or AMD graphics cards.  I have 2 battery orders sitting here that are useless to me because they popped up in a search where they shouldn't have.  Some of these button batteries have several names.  Can't I count on your search engine to get it right?",1
I have done everything humanly possible to stop an order from Amazon of a dog bowl I didn't order but nothing works. I ordered two in August and had them delivered. Fine. The one that's coming now I didn't order and yes it's a cheap item but what if had been very expensive? No wonder people get away with fraud with this kind of security. I have been with them for years and it's never happened before. Is it a trial run?Sorry Amazon but you deserved this!,0
"Awful experience - brought a phone for my elderly mother, it didn’t work. Was told to return to the repair department. I’ve been waiting weeks. No update, no response, customer service or repairs have not been coming back to me. Completely ignored. Phone was needed as a lifeline for my mother. Don’t buy a phone off Amazon. Go to a phone shop so you have some come back.",0

"After receiving a junk radio that I wanted to exchange I was told there is only a refund option. So now I have to tear my dash apart asap to remove the junk radio and drive around for 2 weeks with a hole in my dash, just to tear my dash open again to install the new radio when it comes in. The most complicated process just for a company to right the wrong they sent ",0

"Amazon puts a delivery date on the order, but never delivers on that date. Drivers can't read, or don't read delivery notes. They should put a realistic date for delivery and stick to it, like UPS or FEDEX.",0
Amazon is awesome and has great customer service. The end.,2
Quick support... very nice,1
"I have been a customer for almost a decade now. The only time things go awry is if I haven't bothered to read the reviews about an item I purchased or items never arriving. Not reading the reviews is my own fault. Items not arriving or not delivered directly to me have always been replaced immediately by Amazon at no extra cost. They've always been good to me despite a few mishaps. Staff are polite and helpful. I've even got to know the delivery drivers quite well.Unlike some other major players (CEX) I have nothing, but praise for them and hope to continue being a customer for another decade at least.Keep up the good work ladies and gentlemen.",2
The best return policy. Stands behind prime members.Offers discounts and gift cards to solve problems.What more can you ask for.Don't listen to the cry babies.,2
Ordered a gold plated chain for fancy dress party but got delayed in customs for two weeks due to brexit and hence pointless. Shouldn’t be advertised to be delivered as two days shipment,1
I wish I could say ZERO!!  Amazon delivered my package to the wrong house and customer service had the nerve to get an attitude with me!!  Rep named Lexi had the nerve to say be careful how I speak to her via Chat!!  I will be calling the corporate office Monday!!  My package was over $200 and the pic even shows the wrong house number!!!  Horrible!!,0
Amazon is only efficient when there are no problems. When something goes wrong then the prime membership next day deliveries go out the window. Estimates of 10 days for replacements are unacceptable when new ones are still available for next day.,0

Bad stance on pre-orders from Amazon UK.The whole point of pre-ordering games is to guarantee that hardcore gamers like myself get games as soon as possible.I pre ordered WWE 2K18 Deluxe Edition around a month in advance to get the pre-order bonus and mainly to get it 4 days early. It has not arrived and is now in limbo with regards to when I get it.Amazon's response? The game is unavailable and out of stock due to high demand and it'll take us 2-3 business days to give you a response from another department.Out of stock is supposed to be impossible when pre-ordering since they guarantee receipt of the game on release day.I eventually received £10 off at Amazon which is useful but does nothing for the integrity of a pre-order guarantee. This is the third time Amazon have failed to get a WWE game to me as per the pre-order guarantee.,0
"Congratulations Amazon, your customer service has hit a new low.  Apparently, Amazon.ca and Amazon.mx are not controlled by Amazon in the US.  And no one at Amazon seems to know who does.  Effing Brilliant! So don't worry, ladies and gents, if their foreign platforms commit fraud there is not a damn thing Amazon will do about it so you won't need to waste your time contacting them. And after being told I had to speak to a customer service supervisor in order to get to someone who has some control over those marketplaces, the supervisor then promptly disconnected our call.  Bravo for excellent service - Jack the Supervisor!",0

"Literally ridiculous that I have now been charged $86 twice, for the same item. Customer service is obviously outsourced because I had a difficult time understanding her. I now only have $6 in my bank acct to last me for the next six days due to this ridiculousness. I was also informed that I would be credited back in two business days and than, received an email stating that I wouldn't be.

"I don't know if the issue I'm having is too complicated for Amazon representatives or if Amazon decided not to be helpful anymore (it seems like Amazon's new policy is ""we're insanely big so we don't care about our customers anymore..."") but I've been having issues with Amazon Chat representatives attitude in the last 3 months.I received no help, extremely unfriendly service and felt like no one is willing to help!!! it really felt like Amazon doesn't care if I'm going to stay a loyal customer or not.I don't know if anyone with ability to do anything is going to read this but this is the main reason why I'm not going to make any additional purchases on Amazon and will not renew my membership as well as stop using my Amazon store Card.I truly hope someone who cares will read this and be able to do something. Until then, I'm not going to shop on Amazon or use any of Amazon additional services...",0
I would leave zero stars but you know the drill. I’ve had two packages over the past 10 days marked “delivered hand delivered to customer.” Both packages were neither hand delivered or delivered at all. Forget trying to call customer service. There is no way to speak to an actual person. It’s all automated. To make things worse the option to request a refund is no longer available for the missing items.,0
"Amazon too much in taxes, everything they tax now.",0
"Amazon are trying to con their customers into signing up for Prime by constantly harassing them whenever they wish to purchase something. They further compound their evil behavior by offering ""Free Delivery"" in the item listing but making it impossible to access this option during the purchase process. This disrespect and abuse of their customer's trust and goodwill surely must be rewarded by a mass exodus of customers to more honest and reliable retailers. We have long heard of how Amazon treat their staff like slaves and now they are showing similar disdain for their customers. It is time we all started exercising the power of our wallets and declining to spend money with Amazon.",0
"Amazon sent me an email to ""upgrade"" to a business amex card with a free 100 pounds amazon voucher.Except of course, it's a con and deep inside the terms and conditions it says blablabla and you end up applying for a business amex card and then end up with no 100 pounds.AVOID AVOID this MISLEADING advertisement at all costs!",0
"What an absolute sham of a company when it comes to customer service! I added a new card to my account then bought a gift card to send to a friend, said order successful and I received the confirmation email. Immediately got locked out of my account due to suspicious activity on my account. There is absolutely no way to contact customer service, it just redirects you to the login page over and over. No options whatsoever of any phone numbers to call customer service. I even tried downloading the app, tried signing in but couldn't, was asked by the app to call customer service  number which was an invalid number. Going round and round in circles and getting nowhere. How is this even legal? They let you add your credit/debit card which you then confirm your card with your bank and then amazon block your account once you try to use your own already verified card? W.T.F!

"Decent online shop, friendly customer support and fast shipping, I only have two minors complaint about Amazon and hope they can improve on it. Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement. SERIOUSLY!? For the past 10 orders, I do not have any problems with my billing address. In the end have to create a brand new account.",1

"Amazon has stolen so much of my time, money, and energy from me and if I can do business with anyone else, I will. First, my account was deleted with no notice, along with all my wish lists that I spent hours organizing and adding to, all my account credits, all my order history, and all my gift cards, all my kindle books, and my 5 months of kindle unlimited free Bc I had just bought a kindle and signed up for unlimited. All gone. $500 and countless hours, all gone. I’ve spent HOURS on the phone with “customer service” and they simply can’t do sh** except offer me $5 which they still haven’t done. They can’t even do that! Ha! What a joke of a business. I had an account in Spain when I lived there and that’s the account I wanted to cancel. Not my US one. And the only reason I went to cancel it was Bc I got an email from Amazon music saying I had 3 months free based off a recent order I placed in AMERICA and when I went to use it, it said I couldn’t Bc There’s no amazon music in SPAIN. So obviously things were getting tangled and I wanted to get rid of Spain account so I could use amazon music on American account. I called amazon “customer service” before doing so trying to find out why that happened and if I cancelled nothing would happen to American account. They assured me accounts were not linked at all. So I cancelled. And 2 weeks later I get an email saying EVERYTHING is gone. And now it’s all apparently in cyber space and they can’t get it back. No emails, nothing in those 2 weeks verifying if I want to cancel my account. NOTHING. It’s just gone one day. Oh well. Nothing they can do. Amazon I hope you get lost in cyber space you piece of sh**. And then when I go to create a new account, it’s recommending me products based off recently sold items from my old account!! So how is it that they can’t recover my account but Amazon knows what I last bought in my old account?? WT*?! AND SO NOW, today, 3 months after this sh** went down, I received an Amazon gift card and went to add it to my account and get back on my kindle that I haven’t been able to read on much yet Bc amazon is a piece of sh**, and I immediately get locked out of my account. And to get back in, I need to send in a copy of my gift card reciept. I don’t have my gift card receipt Bc I didn’t buy my gift card bc it was a gift!!!!! AHHHHHH! And so I called “customer service” and they said it could be up to Tuesday until my account isn’t on hold anymore. Today is Friday. All I wanted to do was read a f****** book. F you amazon. F you. You owe me. I hope you get a million competitors and go out of biz. You don’t deserve to be in biz you piece of sh**.",0

I placed a LARGE order through amazon and many items were considered undeliverable to the address and were returned by USPS. However that was on the 23rd of JUNE! I am now in JULY and still no refund has come across. I spoke with AMAZON and no person will give me a refund for the items I did not receive. It is crazy that they have no problem taking your 1k amount for the items you ordered but when it comes to getting a refund for the undeliverable items they will not give it.

"At Amazon.com, I am a valued customer and receive respectful customer support and support. If I buy an item for $ 1, I can leave a review for this item and for the seller.After I bought two well-written, interesting books with an absolutely average cover (the books fell apart) from Amazon.de, I wanted to write a customer review. My rating was rejected on the grounds that I did not meet the minimum order value. The minimum order value is 50 + EURO in one year. I was shocked.Amazon.de customer support stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1
"HORRIBLE service! Never got two of the items I had ordered on 4/5 that was supposed to be here by the next day 4/6. By 4/12 I had contacted them TWICE asking what's going on after I had gotten a notice that the delivery had been CANCELED as I did NOT cancel the order. The 1st time I contacted them and asked them why the order had been canceled they claimed the order was NOT canceled and that I should get it soon (LMAO YEAH RIGHT). even though my tracking link said otherwise that my order was being sent back to amazon as they had canceled it. 5 DAYS LATER STILL NO DELIVERY. Such a waste of time and they are such CROOKS! Just want your money and think you will forget about it! TOTAL SCAM! I don't see how Amazon is allowed to stay in business with such SHADY business practices. They finally gave me a refund after telling me the order WAS CANCELED like I had told them it was originally, so I could reorder, and they had also told me they would refund me a month's payment of PRIME for my trouble and all the TIME I wasted since the product did NOT come in a timely manner as it did not even come at ALL! Now I am STILL waiting for my refund for THAT. I'm sure I will have to contact them AGAIN about that to get my refund for my membership. Will be canceling membership ASAP as they have gone downhill and cannot support such a crappy business who does NOT EVEN HONOR THEIR OWN PROMISES AND DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. JUST GROSS!  Customers should NOT have to keep at a company over and over again to ensure that the company does WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. Would give ZERO stars if I could!! :/",0

Customer support going downhill. Kind of tired of talking to people overseas who can't vocalize. Selection still great and order quick and cheap.,1
Overall amazon have been pretty decent but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as ordinary as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,1

"I go on, I click what I want, I agree with the price or not, if I don’t I delete the item and find another. I complete order and wait... nothing complicated and I can’t fault them I really can’t Think it’s easy to blame the website when it’s really the individual seller that’s at fault",2

I needed to change my phone number on file because i could not access the amazon store app. It is not an easy process at all.

Ended up having to return it for a refund, and am now having to reorder the game in the hopes that the game I wanted in the first place will turn up.",0
"I've used Amazon on numerous occasions, ordering cd's, dvd's, photographic equipment, books, gift vouchers etc. and have always had great service. My items have all been received on time and have been exactly as described. I always use the Super Saver offer where applicable and this has saved me a substantial amount in postal fees.",2
Amazon is pretty decent.It's useful for cheeper price and decent quality goodss.,1
Both Amazon and a seller on Amazon cheated me out of 200£ on some shoes I bout on the page They said they were original absolute lie send them back said they refunded me but never got it and called Amazon and was met with abuse from the Amazon agent,0

Received the nuts as a gift; there was no card inside to tell me who sent it. I have called multiple time with no answer or return call. Also left an email. The address is an Amazon distribution facility. How can I thank someone if there is no way to know who sent me the gift.,0

"For the price, Amazon is great! But as far as reviews. They're suspect. And most customers use the reviews to help them purchase products. So, it goes without saying that it helps the bottom line. For example, I reviewed a product I previously gave a 4-star based on the price-point-to-quality, but then the seller offered me an Amazon gift card to give them a 5-star instead! I promptly gave them a 2-star...just for that. My thought was ""how many of these so-called 5-stars are paid for?"" Basically, dishonesty is a minus 2 star to me. So I wrote about it in my critique. Guess what? Amazon removed it. Why? Because it was against guidelines. What in the world are they talking about? I read through the guidelines and there's nothing there that suggest I can't change my rating or that I can't criticize someone for bribing me to give them a rating they want. In fact, I another review and it kept getting removed. The only ones left were 4 to 5-star ratings. And criticize Amazon's products and service itself? Wo, Amazon will warn you that you're somehow violating their guidelines. You can criticize other products and services they sell through Amazon, but stuff that Amazon does they don't want you to criticize. The truth of the matter is there are cheaper places to get stuff at. In fact, I've reduced my expenditure on Amazon to 80% online purchases to 50% online purchases. You just have to do your due-diligence as a consumer. The 5% back is an attractive feature Amazon has, but sometimes you can save more than that in other distributors. Amazon is like the Facebook of retail sales, eventually you realize you shouldn't really be supporting a model that doesn't actually represent the free-market and democratic principles we Americans hold...even if you have to pay an extra buck elsewhere.",0
Amazon overall deliver a acceptable support but it can fall down when some of its suppliers provide a very average support. In my case I bought 3 cat Webbox  sticks from Staks and Co. They offered no return support. I paid £8.19which I had assumed  was for 3 X 3 packets of Webbox Cat sticks and so I paid £8.19. They sent me 3 so i paid £2.73 eachper  packet when they only cost £1.00 in Morrisons. Don't use Staks and Co unless you are very rich.   Oh and no returns.,1
"I received an item that was incorrectly described and had to return it by Hermes, which on this occasion was all that was offered.After 1 week I had not received any acknowledgment of my return so I contacted Amazon via the chat service.I think the person at the other end must have nodded off as I was asked to wait a moment, which turned into 7 minutes.The chat took 27 minutes and I ended up leaving without an answer. Once they have your money the customer counts for nothing.Disgraceful.",0
"So after being a loyal and using amazon for 99 percent of my Christmas shopping for a good few years I’ve finally had enough of them! This year the list has been endless, fighting none stop to get refunds, Amazon making excuses as items are from 3rd party sellers so they can’t get involved 😡 yes they can when if suits them, had a faulty e scooter that took 4 months of fighting to get a refund, now my daughters Segway has gone faulty after 10 month, again no back up as it was from a seller, the seller is refusing to help, I’ve bought insurance can’t claim as it’s still under manufacturer warranty Amazon sitting on the fence saying they can’t do anything.So this year guys I’m back to proper shops like smyths, Argos who offer proper warranty’s, sometimes I have actually paid extra from Amazon too just for the back up of something going wrong 🤦‍♀️Now going to avoid congrats guys for loosing another loyal customer 👏",0
"I’ve bought from Amazon for the last time!!! They would not help me at all after I was scammed by a third party seller, Tek Star. Told me I didn’t qualify for their A to Z guarantee but couldn’t tell me why.  Bought a pc from tek star, a third party seller on their site.  When I received the pc it wasn’t built completely,  connections not made on the inside and couldn’t connect my cords from the outside because the video card was hanging lop sided.  Sent the pc back the same day.  Total cost was 914 and some change.  Tek Star is charging me 776.00 restocking fee and only refunded 138.00.  They are saying I sent back a different item than they sent me.  Amazon is refusing to help me and got nothing but the run around from 3 of their employees during a 3 day span.  Amazon told me I didn’t qualify for their A to Z guarantee and wouldn’t tell me why.  They gave me an email address to send me issue to, LOL and my email came back undeliverable.  Be aware!!!  Scamming third party seller and Amazon will leave you hanging.  I’ve since disputed the charge w my cc  company.",0

"I am not crazy about Amazon  especially in the near future due to most store fronts closing down. Amazon is the lead reason for this not   Covid 19 or any  pandemic. Just look around at empty malls or more and more  stores closing in all areas. Think about it, aren't you going to miss family events when shopping together  example school shopping, spring break, summer time,  clubbing, vacation shopping, walking, ice cream and at the end of your shopping spree day with your family. Finally dinning in to a nice restaurant  to mingle with your family and friends. Ps. also won't you miss trying on your new  bikini  with your friends?          Pss. I don't know about you, but I LOVE to try before I Buy. Or having this beautiful day shopping with your family. Or you can just sit at home alone in front of your computer and order everything you want, then return it when it wasn't exactly what you wanted or didn't fit  from Amazon.",0
"If you still use the business, it means that it's decent for you :).I use it, so it's still decent and I appreciate it.On the negative side, it's annoying how they keep pushing for their prime membership.And it's even worse for the more vulnerable population.My older relatives who aren't tech savvy have fallen for that Prime trap paying for something they didn't want and don't even use.The prices are also higher than many other competitors online, including from Ebay.So I always look on other places first.Finally, I don't trust the reviews there.But all in all, I still use it and appreciate the ease of shopping at a nearby pick-up spot whenever available.",1
I think it's very convenient. I think it has the largest number of product listings in the world. The only thing that would make it better is if the shipping costs were lower.,2

"I am not keen on giving negative reviews, though Amazon deliveries are regularly lost or damaged. My recent book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable. I spend a whole day at home waiting for the parcel to arrive anytime before 8pm and just after 8 pm I get notified that my book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable.

I am living in the uk and I have a British bank account as well as German account because I have moved 5 years ago to the UK.

"Amazon support is the worst. I got a defective item and it stopped working just days after the return window. The seller said they would send a replacement and to have amazon support help me with getting the shipping handled since their products are in amazons warehouse. The agents refused to listen or help and just copy and paste the same responses. They refuse to help and then lie to customers. One amazon agent told me that sellers have sent replacements to customers in the past, so that meant for a FACT that this seller also has a personal warehouse. Literally said it was a fact, but then when I asked if that seller for a fact has a warehouse because the agent knew of some sellers having their own warehouses? the agent refused to respond and just kept changing the subject. I asked the agent how they could know for a fact that the agent had a warehouse? Refused to answer. So I asked if they lied about knowing for a fact that the Seller had a warehouse, and the agent said that they could not confirm or deny that.... Wow amazon. Went from stellar support to almost one star reviews on trust pilot... Not to mention stores like costco (their membership costs less than amazons even) offers 90 day returns. Walmart, with NO membership offers 90 day returns as well and I have never had issues with their support either. You spend days trying to get help and get no resolutions. With all the money amazon generates, put some money BACK into customer service, and stop outsourcing the work to people who could not give less of a damn about the customers or their experience.",0
"I am really disappointed with Amazon.  I have been a loyal customer for the last 6 years.  Have made several orders.  Once I ordered a laptop and the screen was broken.  I had no way of getting a refund.  They over charged me for orders for Sales tax and delivery during the pandemic, and now I'm locked out of my account. I tried calling customer service but they couldn't solve me issue. They never appreciated me as a loyal customer after all these years.  I think I'm done with them.  I have never felt so disappointed and abandoned.",0
Got my kitty litter delivered but it was clumping kitty litter and we have had ice and snow which is now melting and amazon leaves the kitty litter in the water from melting snow and ice.

"Amazon USED to be great! However, I have found them to be falling off the last two years or so...all of a sudden there is a proliferation of vendors selling such extremely poor quality yet overpriced Chinese merchandise as to be actually frightening.

Items are being delivered by the USPS, which is not known for promptness nor gentleness-my last item was deliverrd in a padded bag that had a large tear and black streaks. I will certainly be immensely more reticent about placing future orders with Amazon. A shame...",1

I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen.

"Amazon first claimed the parcel had been shipped, when it fact, they lost it, and the courier never picked it up.Then they claimed it was only delayed.Then they on 3 occassions claimed they would issue a refund - despite their own site showing ""this may be lost"" and the DPD tracker showing the item was never picked up.Weeks later, 3 lies about refunding in 7 days, and the most blunt customer disservice.Still over two-and-a-half-grand out of pocket because they lost a high value item.",0

"I have been an Amazon customer since the very beginning - in the UK, the US and now France. I think their service quality is astonishingly good. Living in rural France it is a lifesaver. Just recently I have had my first returns and they were handled quickly and without fuss - maybe thanks to my many, many orders over the years. I think they should pay far more tax and pay their employees way more money - and I'd be happy to pay an extra 15% if I was confident it was going to staff wages.",2

"Amazon's customer service is reliable. The chat can quickly connect you to an associate, and a human resolved my return issues for a product recall within minutes. Amazon customer service has been consistently efficient in resolving any issues over the years that I purchased from Amazon. I really appreciate those associates' help, thank you.",2
"At one time, Amazon was an efficient, reliable and customer-focused organization. That being said, over the past 24 months, they have become one of the most unreliable and inefficient logistical/retail services I have ever dealt with. Products take longer to arrive when compared to other retailers who don't charge an annual fee and delivery windows are often missed. Customer service agents are based outside of North American and for the most part, are difficult to deal with and generally require further explanation and reiteration to resolve the most basic issues. We have also noticed a steep decline in Amazon's streaming services including the quality and reliability of the content. Lastly, we have found Amazon's customer experience extremely poor. Streaming subscriptions that provided specific movies, that we have maintained for several years are no longer available and can only be ""purchased or rented"". This is extremely poor practice and given that it appears to be (primarily) the movies we have watched, I am inclined to believe that this is an intentional act to force us to buy these movies despite already paying for the subscription. We will be canceling our Prime membership, along with all subscriptions in November when they raise the price.",0
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after prices were raised and prices are higher than in stores already. Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal interaction.",1

Customer service was horrible guy called Aziz when constantly asked put me onto a manager he said then I am the manager when clearly he was not... amazon clearly states on their page that if an item has not been delivered in the guaranteed time frame they said it would be delivered in they are supposed to compensate their customers... I got told no I was lying and to send their customer service a link.. ? Maybe read into your own policy's before you turn people down. Still waiting on my orders... with 0 help horrible staff,0

Reliable and fast,2
Parcel arrived a few days late but in acceptable condition ,1
I think considering Amazon is a multi-billion pound company they should give you an average time when your parcel will be delivered instead of having to wait in from 8 o'clock in the morning till 9 at night for your parcel to get delivered they say they can leave it somewhere but what if you don't have anywhere to leave it as it will get stolen I think it is ridiculous and they need to look into this matter to give people around about time your parcel will be getting delivered instead of having to hang around all day especially on a Day Like This with the sun is shining you don't get many they seem to be up to date with everything else so why not delivery times,0
"Awful company. Refuse to refund payments for wrong deliveries, missing deliveries stated as being 'stolen' by customer service but nothing done about it, customer service always saying I'd be contacted within 24 hours by email or phone, but that never happens. The place is full of a bunch of liars who don't understand how to do their jobs and don't give a damn about their customers.No way am I spending a penny with these crooks ever again.",0
"Don't order an Xbox from Amazon. They will send you the wrong item. It's happened to me, and it happened to a friend. I asked for a replacement which they said they would do; then another 'Amazon team' decided they couldn't. Another annoying thing if you want customer service on android, don't bother. The keyboard covers what you are typing on android, making it impossible to type. The only saving grace is they gave me a refund quickly. But this sort of thing shouldn't happen",0

"I have been an Amazon customer for many years, I have been a PRIME member for the last 4 years. I enjoy shopping on Amazon, you can find ANYTHING you want, I'm amazed at the large selection of products that you can find. The prices are always competitive, most of the time the best price around the internet. No tax for me in FL plus Free shipping with Prime membership. Prime membership gives you access to movies. Plus the free space in the cloud, the Amazon player, the electronic download for software, very very convenient.  For more savings I use the subscribe and save, again very convenient and unique to Amazon. Overall a great shopping experience. This is why I come back, I order from Amazon almost every week.  Oh and the customer service is so easy to deal with, they will help you in no time and fix whatever issue you might have. The only problem I have I would say is if Amazon would accept PayPal, this would be the best of the best... still highly recommended.",2
"Had a prime account associated with an email I no longer had control of. The associate indicated they would cancel the prime membership and refund a period of the charging as I was not using the benefits. That was more than I could have asked for. What I was after was an email for officially closing the account down. I never received that email. Or the refund. Nor was the prime membership cancelled.A lot of the actions they said they were taking were right there as we were speaking. I'm confused that I spent all that time and we achieved nothing. Ultimately I was able to get control of the email linked to the prime account. Customer service definitely did not play any role in this resolution. Amazon's a good experience when you're buying stuff, but if they start charging your card and you don't know where it's coming from, they sure as hell don't. At least, that's the answer I got from the associate I talked with before the one I discussed above.Stats:-Total Time Spent on Phone: 45 minutes-Satisfaction with Resolution: No resolution",0

"I feel obliged to EDIT this review given latest update in this matter: I have increased the rating to three stars (previously 1 star) since I finally got assistance from another manager who acknowledged the mishandling of my case and compensated me for the mistakes. *Anything below this text is untouched* It bothers me when such a powerful and successful business continue to grow while they are actually not living up to their own greatness... So therefore I'm eager to write a review. (For the first time in my life). I also wrote one on ConsumerAffairs... Unfortunately I don't have fine things to say about Amazon and their attention to customer satisfaction seems below average, despite having so much attention in media about being the best and greatest company in the world. I ordered a spotting scope for my vacation. (NOTE: The item was shipped from and is sold by Amazon.com)I was searching for a certain spotting scope, and I finally found it in stock on Amazon. 14 left. So I order one ASAP. When I receive the package the next week I notice that they sent the wrong item. Well... that's a disappointment, but I would not bash a whole company just because of that. But... Then when trying to order the correct item (only ONE used sample left. fine.. ) I get an error message. I contacted Amazon and they promised me not to worry (like THREE times) and that they would fix it for me. So when they tell me not to worry that many times I trust them about getting this fixed. I get promised:1. They will make sure I will be able to order the correct item even though they seem to almost run out of stock. i.e. I assume they keep one for me. And they would get back to me when they fixed the glitch/error. I would also get 20 USD off.2. They will pick up the wrong item in 2 business day and give me a refund.Sounds great, right? Now I won't go to another company and order the correct item somewhere else, right? Outcome: 1. They DON'T get back to me. And when I reach out and ask them if they fixed the glitch so I could order the correct item they told me they could NOT, AND they have run out of stock. ..that's just great. 2. Also they STILL have not picked up the package and have yet not refund my purchase.So I contact Amazon again:After getting failed twice in a row and thus ruined my chance of getting hands on this quite rare item, I asked them how they were going to help me. Let me put it this way; they were NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK DELIVERY STATUS with the supplier about when they will get the item back in stock. LOL. And for the record, I've been acting very patient the whole time and have had a very decent tone in my writing to them the whole time.A normal, customer satisfaction oriented company would make more effort, but not Amazon. I expected them to provide me with perhaps the correct item that's sold from third party who has it in stock but with a price adjustment compensation (since they sold it for more money) or something similar.And even though one of the agents promised me to give me a price match in case they would change when coming back in stock, the manager I asked to speak to later on told me was misinformation and that they could not even do that. So in conclusion; Amazon failed to deliver correct item and are not willing to make any real effort to make sure I am satisfied as a customer. Hence, I will order the correct item from a competitor and let Amazon pick this wrong item up ASAP. While writing this they still have not picked up the wrong item nor refunded me. Which they initially told me would take two days. It has now been more than a week, and will take more than two weeks in total since I today asked the about this once again and told me 3-5 more business days. That's more than two business days, isn't it? Since the scope is about 1200 USD and since I ordered a new (correct one) from a competitor I will probably have to use my savings/sell shares to afford paying the upcoming amex bill. Just great...",1
This a bit difficult to write a review as Amazon have many different components on its site I've ordered many things from them some of them fantastic others never again the really two big problems I have is when you ask them not to leave on door steps they do and dont put through letter box as dog will eat it and as the person who is delivering doesn't know what's in the parcel it could be harmful to the animal send I know you need to be over 18 to order and  show you are over  that age but am well over that age but they whould not leave it how stupid,1
"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer support woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer support calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after order before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other goodss minutes after order.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1
Stayed in to accept delivery. Could see the delivery one stop away... Then failed to deliver. No one knocked on door or rang bell. Amazon delivery used to be good but its not awful and great at wasting time.,0
Amazon  is absolutely horrible!   They took my money and did not want to issue me a refund even the supervisor was nasty and did not want to make any exceptions disgusting humans!,0
"Been using Amazon for 12 years, when I first started using everything was great, but since Covid the assistance has been lacking when it come to shipment time and the third party sellers. And its crazy since the Amazon fulfillment center is less than ten miles near my house. Hopefully once things settle down things will improve especially with quality items.",1
Item arrived in time but used far too much packaging for my liking. All i ordered was a vinyl record and it came in a cardboard sleeve (which is all it needed) inside a huge and i mean huge box. There was simply no need. I can imagine from a logistical standpoint as well this takes up alot more room in transit and at the factory so why?! It seems to be everything i order from amazon that comes like this and i hate excess packaging from an ecological standpoint. Its the last thing ill be ordering anyway.,0
"My package said delivered but it was nowhere to be found. This has happened before, which is extremely frustrating as I had left detailed instructions on where to leave the package. They were helpful in refunding me which was very kind, however, I think they need to have better communication with their shipping entities.",1
"Well now, Jeff Bezos must be hurting for money.  I pay him for his streaming service, and now he is charging me again.  It would appear he needs to reevaluate his relationship with those who have made him filthy rich.  250 seconds of commercial five time in a 60-minute TV show, and I need to pay him again not to watch those commercials.  That's worse than free TV with rabbit ears.",0
"I'm disappointed that my books aren't up at sights Amazon said they would be for sale at. However, my project manager, Amy is beyond awesome. She has been so helpful, kind, and willing to be there for me for whatever I needed. When I ask that her team fix something she gets right on it. If I don't understand something she is gentle to explain.",1
"I have bought SO many things from Amazone and they have been delivered fast and in good condition. I love Breyer model horses, and Amazone has lots! Great company.",2
Very good delivery. Prime is useful. Great,2
"I used to think Amazon was great. Lately though in not impressed. Takes 10 days to get an order that used to take maybe 3. Tracking is all screwed up.I ordered an item that was in Phoenix. Tracking showed it went from Phoenix to Ontario, from Ontario to Illinois I believe, the the package arrived at my place in Arizona.",0
"The Amazon Company has not met it's responsibility to it's customers. Many of it's items, that used to be delivered in just two days are taking weeks. When you pay an annual fee, you expect promises to be kept!Amazon is also led by an ultra liberal person. It's offering and management of employees reflect that. It sheds a negative aspect of it's very existence!",1
Didnt like the interaction with the seller,1
"I only discovered Amazon last year, and I certainly feel like I've been missing out! Since, I order from Amazon almost every week.The best prices on the web, great support and extremely fast shipping options makes for a brilliant user experience. Would highly recommend!",2
"We have been a Customer for several years now. Most of the time Amazon has been very good. The issue I have is it impossible to Ask a Specific Question about an item before ordering. Also, some of the items are vague- and are not marked New or Used. This results in needless returns, especially, when You’re spending over $100 on one item. There used a place where you could request Amazon packaging instead of Original boxing. How do I stipulate “AMAZON PACKAGING ONLY” for all my items? What happened to “Live Chat” ? Most of the time, everything goes fine. Just one Man’s opinion.",2
Honestly just had to close my account since they've bungled my refund royalyThen the customer service kept saying sorry but did nothing to fix my problem Useless!,0
Never had any problems with using Amazon. The items seem to be better quality than Ebay in general. The buying process is easy and enjoyable.,2
I have been a major user of Amazon Prime for more than 8 years and have NO COMPLAINTS with their service or handling of returns.,2
customer service sucks ass! i've been requesting a refund for over a month on a delivered not here and to this date im still asking for almost $250 in a refund and been waiting business days till im sick. THEN THE REP HAD THE ADUACITY TO SAY HE'S TRANSFERRING ME AND CUT OFF THE CHAT. ALEX is the name and a supervisor named UMESH didnt even spend long on the chat just sent a form and ended it so fast i didnt even get to blink.,0
"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was acceptable timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer support, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your support is no longer acceptable.",1
"Well, it's pretty straight forward. You can pretty much find anything you want on Amazon. It's all about the variety",2
orders can end up anywhere but usually quick,1
"I like amazon, but their prices for prime are getting absurd and I don’t like that you can’t post realistic reviews anymore because they are afraid of losing revenue. They censor your reviews to the point you can’t even review products accurately anymore. I’m almost to the point of writing them off and using eBay exclusively.It’s also very telling to a consumer when the business focuses and spends more time and money censoring reviews than providing quality customer service.",0
I used to be a prime number half of the stuff never was within two or three days it was the same difference as not being a prime member. Recently I purchased a couple of doorbell hardwired kids only one was delivered and I tried to get customer service to expedite shipping on the other one and they couldn’t do anything they said. My experience with customer service has been so poor enough times that I’m actually considering giving up Amazon altogether.,0

"Prices are still decent but assistance going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer assistance and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"Thank you Amazon for giving us the opportunity to buy the pressure washer? We have been able to do multiple things with this item is including pressure washing the house, car seats for our baby, vent hoods, among many other things! We love Amazon for everything our family needs and wants. Thank you!!",2

"Absolutely love Amazon. It has been a lifeline during the Covid-19 pandemic, yeah things have taken a little longer to arrive sometimes, which is totally understandable due to increased volume during the pandemic. We have Prime and highly recommend it. For the money you pay the benefits are superb. We love the Prime benefits like music, movies and books too in our house and our son has loved Alexa on his DOT to help with his homework, and let’s not forget she was a direct line to Santa at Christmas time. Excellent Service and will continue to happily use for many years to come.",2
"Hello! We use amazon A LOT, but recently have had a few issues. Our last amazon driver stole our package in broad day light...

"I have noticed the user interface for Amazon is HORRENDOUS!!! I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription which was so hard to get because you can't do it through the Amazon app or the KU app. I had to find a link through google...WHY SO HARD?? I also got a trial for Amazon music for a month which I cancelled. A few months later it AUTOMATICALLY took money out of my account for Amazon music. Why doesn't it ask you before it just takes money out. Any other place you buy things from it gives you a second to think before you actually get it, but no, not Amazon. WHY SO HARD??? I also tried to get my Amazon Prime Video on my phone which is under a different account but it will AUTOMATICALLY use the account all your other stuff is on but guess what. You can't just log out in one place. You have to  log out of EVERYTHING!! WHY SO HARD!!!! I'm surprised more people don't complain about this. Although Amazon offers a lot it is so difficult to manouver and actually find things through the apps that I keep having to ask google!! Pls hire a better IT team!!",0
"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",0
"Money taken out of my bank for item but after 5 days got cancelled, I got charged they said 5 days refund ,nothing.

If I could give it a Zero Stars I would.Come to find out I was being double billed for almost 3 years.Partially my fault and I accept my responsibility.However when I tried to rectify the issue I was passed around to SIx different customer service representatives.The last representative I talked to on the the phone kept coming back on the phone and told me several times we're working on the issue and to hold the line.I did and 1 hour and 20 minutes later I realized I was screwed.I cancelled my account once and for all.After years of being a decent customer I will never return.Please watch your account and email .,0
"Good evening, Happy Monday!!I just got done talking to Pat Y. I wanted to informed you that he is an EXCELLENT customer service to work with (10 stars). He was so polite and nice. He went above and beyond and was very professional. He definitely knows his job/business. If I could, I would  continue to use him for any online inquiries. His answer were clear and where necessary detailed enough for us to make informed decisions quickly about purchasing another pair of shoes.Great hire manager. He definitely deserve a raise.",2
My card is being used on another account. I let them know but due to data protection they couldn’t tell me anything. No checks have been done and I believe a data breach has happened but they advise they don’t have a complaints policy or procedure for me to follow. ,0
"Basically Amazon are very acceptable for the prices they can offer on innumerable goodss.  What I don't like is that when you buy something online it goes straight from clicking ""Buy"" to ""It is on its way"".  This makes me nervous.  It doesn't go to the page where you have to verify your card details and insert the security code, which other sites have.  This means that either Amazon have found a way of getting around the security code, or else they have recorded it on a previous transaction.  This seems very wrong.  It feels like it would be too easy to buy something by accident when you had only gone there to window-shop.  This makes me want to be cautious and Amazon seem aggressive.  I wish this would stop.",1
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their support, their goodss and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer support representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1

Utterly appauling experience with Amazon and as such have emailed their UK CEO and may relay to Trading Standards/their regulator. Amazon Prime Membership default unless deleted is yet another issue that is most annoying and needs deleting. ,0
"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer assistance used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer assistance but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",1
Delivery sucks and customer service is worse,0
"Generally I like to use Amazon to buy online necessities, their customer service however is difficult to navigate when things go wrong with a purchase and sometimes it’s annoyingly unclear whether I’m purchasing from Amazon themselves or a 3rd party outlet but having Amazon Prime is certainly a plus in knowing that generally a purchase is given a clear and free delivery ",2
I love prime. when  they  first started  it was meh   didn't really have a lot of  stuff I wanted  BUT now  they have  just  about everything  from  cat shirts  to  computers I have bought  and the return  policy is  what makes it unbeatable,2
"Love them BUT the *price fixing* has to stop. One day celcius is 12 bucks for 12 pack. Another day it's 22 for the same one a couple days later. Black Friday and cyber Monday were both scams bcuz I seen the same stuff at same price days prior and after but they advertised 20 to 80 percent off those days and it was not more than 5 percent in all reality. *Deceptive, false advertising*The *fake reviews* have to stop. I always have to sift through and find real pictures of the goods that ends up looking like it's from Alibaba or some knock off company. Those are low standards to follow!",1
"I would give 5 stars and here’s why I’m not. I’ve been using amazon for several years now and they have been great! Especially with prime. Now, here recently they have started delivering packages with their blue or white vans. Every since they started,  I’ve had quite a few issues! I’ve have packages that never showed and had to end up getting my money back or have them resend it. Claiming that my house was not accessible! I’ve been staying here for over a year and NEVER have I had an issue until they started using the random people in these vans! I checked videos from the cameras around my house and it showed where these people are throwing my packages!! I wish I could post the videos!!! Come on amazon you have to do better!",1
Always get my order fast and with zero problems. Thankful for Amazon!,2
"For years I've used them and It's really easy for consumers and sellers/scammers to use and often they don't issue refunds, hint's how the owner became richest person so proceed with caution.",1
"It took me putting a ""man's"" name in the chat in order for anyone overseas to take me seriously.  They took out payments that weren't authorized, claimed they have no record of it, and wouldn't file a dispute even after they said they would need my bank statement, which I was willing to give.  They do not take women seriously at all.  I was on the phone/chat almost all day just trying to get this problem solved.  Once I used my maiden name as a first name, the problem was solved in a matter of minutes.  I am seriously extremely close to closing my account with them.",0

"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer assistance at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1

"The prime fee is not worth it any longer Also, when a package is late they refer you to ups who in turn advise you to contact AmazonThey dont have ownership anymore but expect you to pay for their prime support",1
"My usage with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the order company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
"Become an awful company during this lockdown, unprofessional and complacent!Their policies have gone out the window for the customer, 4 disputes and 2 weeks to achieve a refund, on top of that I was lied to twice that my refund had been processed, which a Manager actually admitted to after a huge argument. Have cancelled my prime, and will not be renewing with this awful company anymore, the film site is rubbish, Netflix is the better option, Amazon music is a compete rip off, you pay £7.99 for Prime, then the thieving CEO of this company wants another £9.99 to get all the music, well guess what you get better music on Spotify for less money and as for shopping, everything is cheaper on Ebay and gets to you just as quick. Plus any problems you're refunded with no issues. There's definitely life without Amazon!!!!",0

"Amazon is becoming less and less accessible, outsourcing calls to non-USA locations. These operators can rarely help with the support needed.

"I paid for prime to have my product shipped quickly. They had no problem charging me for shipping immediately... however it did not say “pay from prime” it said “free shipping”As the arrival date was inching closer the product still has not shipped, I reached out and the response was they have express delivery, it would be there in 24hrs. But I was welcome to cancel my order and buy locally.I receive Amazon gift cards as a form of payment at times and was using one. I asked for further instructions in doing so with no response, in fact I have emailed 3 times since then with no response. It showed that delivery could be as late as 10pm! I’m usually up early for work I had said anything after 6pm is inappropriate as I would be in bed. No response. No product came Monday either! Which is exactly what I was stressing for as this was for work! No product or response all week as I reached out wondering where it was and why they had gone through with the payment rather than reach out about how to buy this locally with my Amazon card (yea I realize this is impossible but it was their suggestion)I received my package at the end of the work week, Friday night and after 6pm no less. They showed me that my money and my business is of no concern to them. They may see gift cards as money already in the pocket but it is up to me to accept those gift cards or not. Which I will no longer be doing. This is the last disappointment I will be going through due to shopping with Amazon... oh yea, they have a warehouse one town over.. so it should have been smooth sailing. BYE AMAZON",0
"I love Amazon! Great products, quick delivery, excellent customer service, but... Double check prices with other sellers, Amazon isn't always cheap. Often it's not even Amazon, but a 3rd party seller on the Amazon platform. Track your delivery with shop.com to make sure you really get it. With doorstep thieves running around, have them drop off the package at a pick-up location if nobody is home, or it may be gone before you get to it. Great return policy, no questions asked.",2
In past 3+ years I’ve had only one poor shopping experience. I average ordering 3-6 items each month and ship to 6 addresses since we RV across USA. I use to order many of my clothes from LL Bean but stopped about a year ago when ordering shirts and slacks and was told shipping time was 7-10 business days. Now with Prime my orders are 2 weekdays away to include Saturday and Sunday deliveries.,2
"For two years I have had nothing but great usage with Amazon, until two months ago when I received notice that I had ordered ( unknown to me) a $100 reload of a gift card, then received a notice that I would be receiving two $50 play stations I ordered (unknown to me). I tried dealing with the customer support reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer support rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really? I will miss the convenience of ordering online but not the nightmare of trying to deal with customer support that can't fix a problem or don't care enough to try.",1
"Amazon representatives including their supervisor threaten to place a hold my account because of a charge back. They told me on the phone and in writing to either drop the dispute against the third party amazon seller not fulfilled by amazon or threaten to place a hold on my account. The amount was exactly $4.04 on August 29, 2019.  I have been a happy and satisfied customer with Amazon since 2004 and have placed many orders.I asked for help in writing explaining the situation but nothing has come as of today (9-07-2019)",0
Okay I have to give 3 stars but will explain. Amazon them self is truly 5 star I have had issues with not receiving items especially from 3rd party’s (scammers) and they refund ASAP and for that I would give them 5 ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ I have to drop 2 stars because of their order assistance is always mysteriously losing  my packages that usually are electronics although they refund me I have to  wait a few days till they see if it is gonna be delivered before they even speak to you about it. Normally it be okay but these last to was for my flight that the refunding and reordering it will not be here in time. I know they contract order company but they need to get this under control. I’m not the only one with this issue.,1

"I’ve always had a good experience and prime deliveries are always two days and what I ordered. Amazon is def my go-to for shopping, prices are still good but harder to find great deals on things I used to be able to, but still better than most stores.",2
I love it......,2
I'm sick and tired of my Amazon purchases being left on the pavement outside my house.No they haven't been handed to resident.....they've been dumped outside in the rain.,2
always expansive,1
"This is absolutely ridiculous, they lose your stuff and don’t even care. I’m paying prime for what? To be messed over and roll the dice they don’t lose my package? Get real…",0
I love to shop at Amazon.com as regular basis because they are most efficient and best shopping place at online. I will hoghly recommend anyone to shop here. Their refund process at prime is hassle free. Excellent customer service and you can get thing so quick on time.mmost of all they are trustful online source. I am feeling good to be Prime member enjoying my shopping every time. I love Amazon service.,2

"Amazon prime is useless, it says next day delivery and item wont be here for another 4 days! Rude customer service, makes up loads of lies. DO NOT USE PRIME.",0
Been a prime member for years now and I can’t really say anything bad about the service they offer for such a small monthly subscription. I recently purchased from them and the delivery was the same day and that was a shock given how long you wait compared to other company’s. Any problems Ive had with orders which are very rare and have alway been resolved in a very timely manner.,2
"Prime customer, order every few days, very rarely let down :)",2
"RUBBISH, EVERYTHING IS LONG AND LAZY GIANT PONZI SCHEME",0
"Amazon failed to deliver an item 3 times - then did not refund me then failed to close my account and delete my data as requested ( breaching the data protection act ) They purposely make closing the account difficult to do and ""no on is available on the phone "" - reason is they are too busy making huge amounts of money while ignoring customer service - blame the virus !!!! they are coining it in",0
Never had any issues amazon prime fine for.next day shipment not really using amazon as much as i used to as i feel there prices are getting quite expensive used to use them for my tropical fish filter sponge and stones but its an add on item now meaning i have to spend something like £20 to get something at £3 meaning i now have to travel 25 miles to our nearest wilko for them. The pantry also a rip off shipment dearer than actual items.,1
ive had amazon for years so many problems like they charged me 4-6 times the same month for prime. When i talked to someone they act like they cant find out why they charged me so many times oh we cant see iit on our end when it cleary said amazon prime multiple times on my bank statement. also had many other weird charges from them. they also let the sellers do whatever they want even sell cracked wood for a bed lie on the description of thier products they have no protection for costumers at all. they seem to only care about the sellers. amazon is such a scam so after years of ordering and this bullcrap giving them many chances they now have blocked my account claiming that the card i pay with isnt mine or my husbands card. cant even get the prime payment refunded that i paid this month. never again do not use amazon,0

Amazon courier left a valuable order sticking out of the postbox today.  Told Amazon that the package was handed to the resident. The driver lied and was unprofessional. ,0

"Delivery NO STARS: They mainly use UPS which has consistently lost or wrong address delivered packages. UPS refuses to take any fault for packages they lose or deliver to the wrong home, sometimes even in the completely wrong state or town which should be something easy to notice. But apparently as long as they delivered it, it shouldn't matter where and they shouldn't have to refund the item or replace it. It's absolutely disgusting business tactics and their affiliation with UPS Will only ruin their reputation as it continues. I RECOMMEND FINDING A SERVICE NEAR YOU OR ONLY ORDERING FROM CITES THAT USE FEDEX OR REGULAR POSTAL DELIVERY AND NOT UPS. Products 3 stars: pretty wide range of items you'll find anything you need. Its 50 50 on price it'll either cost more than your local store or less so it can be a bargain if used right. ALWAYS READ PRODUCT REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE. you'd be surprised what items actually pose the most issues but trust the most recent reviews and make your purchase accordingly. Sometimes the item is decent but the means of shipment are awful. Prices 3 stars: all prices are basic standard prices not really any higher ir lower than local prices. You'll save as much as you would using coupons on a store basically. But if you dont like going out because your sick or other reasons, it is very useful to avoid social contact. Customer support 5 stars: these guys are not playing games. If you lose money, theyr losing money to. Take advantage of customer support and be patient! I have had wonderful results and always ended up getting a refund or a return with their help, all be it sometimes it's a long process so again, patience is key. But they will hunt people down for you no joke.",1
"Order today get it tomorrow is woderful.  Sometimes I think  I may never have to leave the house again.  I have never been disappointed , Amazon does exactly what it promises every time.",2
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, items are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with items directly from Amazon, I find their assistances lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1
Very well written the format was great the footnotes were helpful acceptable reading material I felt the sadness and joy,1
It's really hard to return items I almost rather take the loss on the average purchase,1
"What is happening with Amazon and some of their Vendors? I filed a complaint about a product that was arriving by 8 pm and never showed up. When I look at the tracking number it is with some unknown shipper and has not even been shipped even though the amazon site says shipped. The product was coming from Alaska, but really China. Checked the odd tracking number and it hasn’t even shipped from China who knows when of id it will ship.I did online chat and was transferred 5 times to different people, didn’t ask to be transferred and had to start all over again. I contacted the vendor asking where is my product or money only to get an email , Hi, stay safe message. Because I contacted the vendor a second time asking where is my item Amazon says I have to wait 48 hours for a response before they can do anything. Doesn’t matter I already contacted the vendor once before. They don't care that my money is gone and the product is way over due. Amazon may contact the vendor, maybe file an A to Z complaint and another month goes by and Amazon has my money. I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen. Amazon could have read the complaints from all the other people who have not gotten the product, but chose not to. Amazon has removed this item from their site like the other 2 items I had the same issue with.  I told Amazon I would file a dispute with my bank and they said,  go ahead file a dispute with you bank. This is the third time something like this has happened. What has happened to customer service? What happened to Amazon backs their items? Why is Amazon taking customer money so quickly for items before they are shipped? Do they not trust their third party vendors? Amazon is not the Amazon they use to be.",0

"I just opened an account on Amazon and made 3 orders for my home, the parcels were delivered not by Amazon delivery, but by another company, they arrived neatly packaged and they even took pictures of my house :) My house is located further from all the houses and other deliveries from other stores, for some reason they always sent me to the wrong place, although I write the address exactly, I hope this will not cause me any more problems. I also started keeping an eye on hot offers and am looking forward to ordering all sorts of little things for myself. If there are any problems, I will update the review.",2
"Don't know what I'd do without Amazon, I do most of my online shopping here. Never had any problems, fast and reliable.",2
Overall I rate Amazon as A-.  Deliveries are sometimes optimistic in that the date given prior to ordering is sometimes altered after placing an order. When an order does go wrong (infrequently) Amazon usually pull out all the stops to remedy the situation.,2

"My favorite destination for online shopping. I always shopping from amazon. It is a trusted platform for online shopping. But in nowadays, Amazon is becoming Flipkart.

They failed to deliver a luggage on time even though I ordered in with plenty of leeway. Since I left the country (luggage!) I could not use it. The carrier was UPS. UPS is known to have the worst reviews for delivery yet Amazon uses them. I am afraid that this trillion dollar company has very poor customer service or quality and should be broken up. I am also not sure if I will even get a refund since someone else might accept it and if the delivery person does not seek proof of ID then it could even be fraud even though it was not delivered to me as I was not there. The reason we have delivery time frames is because people move and need stuff based on the promises Amazon makes. Even with a window of safety they failed.,0

"My moan is about the order assistance provided by their Enfield (North London) Delivery Depot.Amazon Tracking states that packages leave their depot around NOON, yes noon.Most of my orders are delivered to my local 'locker' which happens to be within a Post Office which, on a Saturday, closes at 3 pm!!!!! Should I have a order to home the drivers have a tendency to tap on the glass in and surrounding the front door (which rarely I can hear), why I have no idea because there are TWO working doorbells which would be impossible to miss.",1

"I've had another great experience with Amazon this past week and just wanted to give them a little more praise. I had signed up a couple weeks ago for a free trial of their Prime membership and while I liked it, I don't think I'd use it or its services enough to justify the cost so I had planned on cancelling it before my trial ran out... but I forgot to cancel in time! I noticed the charge to my bank account and called Amazon that day to say i didn't want the service and wanted a refund; I expected to have a huge fight about it but lo and behold, the first customer service rep I talked to took care of the charge right away as soon as I had explained my issue! No fuss and no fighting! That's the way a company with any sort of membership plans should be ran. A+ work Amazon!",2

"I order alot from Amazon. One thing I do not like is when my order is delivered they do not ring the door bell. I live in a semi average neighborhood and in apartments. I do not know why they can literally walk right up here set my package at my door, take a picture of it but not ring the bell. Every time. I only had 2 people ring the bell out of 30-40 orders. It just tells me the company does not care if you get your order or not. They only want to make a sell and protect themselves.",1
"No need to review the store... That's all decent. Even great. Huge item range, relatively fast and cheap shipment options to New Zealand. What's not to like?Well, Amazon Prime video... The movies and TV shows they offer to NZ customers are better than Netflix NZ, but it is impossible to watch 'em. Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ. It's just impossible to use Amazon Prime in NZ. Cancelled the subscription. Back to the more-or-less-crappy alternatives, we have here.",1

"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative interaction with Amazon customer assistance over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a order date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer assistance to get a more specific order date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in order. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended interaction with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
Great experience of shopping with this app..Their customer care is very helpful and supportive..,2
Can't fault Amazon! Products are of good quality and speedy delivery. Always reliable as well and customer service is amazing. Would recommend to anyone!,2
"I purchased an OtterBox defender phone case on December 11 and the color was wrong so I returned it, been waiting for weeks for some kind of word on my $38 and when I call amazon iam told that they refunded a completely different card, not the one used to purchase this item but one from over a year ago Nov 2018 to be exact that I had purchased an OtterBox on over a year ago! When I pointed this out that it was a different card that was used to purchase this , Amazon didn’t seem concerned about it and said that I should try to contact the card issuer to find my money! I don’t even know what card it was ? I wasn’t given the last 4 of it or anything! I was so shocked I asked for the transcript so I could read it again. Customer service is non existent at this so called American Company! Nor do they employ anyone American at thier customer service.",0
"They are about the worst thimf ever most corrupt idiotic people I’ve ever come in contact with. Jeff Bezos is a narcissist and let all the money he made go to his head. The site is inoperable for the most part and when it is operable and you can actually place an order don’t expect to get what you ordered or get it when you expected it. You will get the wronf items with no customer care to back it up . The customer care chat is only available in the app and it malfunctions. Though it malfunctions, the people who respond also have noAccess to actually assist with anything . They just want to call you and waste moreTime. Who would do this except a narcissist ? Who would have rules like this ? Also in spite of all the times their company is messed up in other accords, the weird thing was my account was blocked because of me using it. So I used to a few other times before and got poor service so I quit using it but someone wanted a gift card so I sent them one and the account was LOCKED because they thought it was fraud even tho it came fromMy IP address. So I do I like chat like I say they people there are of no use they just want me to call. This was for a friends birthday . Time is sensitive in this regard . Wake up",0

"I have been an amazon customer for many years and a prime subscriber for nearly as long. Recently, i have notices a sharp decline in the service provided by Amazon, most notably, their inability to deliver items on time or even on the same day. I order a pair of headphones for next day delivery which were dispatched that day, then shipped in the early hours, the item was sent out for delivery and a slot for delivery was sent. This time came and went and a corporate apology e mail sent. Having waiting in all day, I had to go out and at 9pm, I received a call, stating a delivery was attempted but i was not in. Driver said he would deliver following day. Today, i have been informed that the item has been sent back to the local sorting office and a delay has been experienced in delivery and no one knows (or cares, as they have my money) why or when i will receive the item and this is on the Prime service.This is FAR FROM A PRIME SERVICE and is happening more often than not now. Not only to you pay your annual subscription, you also pay a PREMIUM PRICE for PREMIUM DELIVERY which doesn’t occur. I have attempted to speak with customer service who just read out and repeat the scant information from the tracking info. In reality, the delivery companies take on work beyond their abilities in their greedy pursuit of wealth and when things go wrong, they just brush the problem aside and carry on as if nothing has happened, they have no real strategy for dealing with balls ups. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and I shan’t be using Amazon anymore, there are better and more reliable options out there. This seems to be my only option now and i advise others to do the same and save their money! NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
"Mixed purchases, arrived earlier than expected.No problem.thanks",2
I really love Amazon.Very efficient service.Huge variety of products.As a buyer all my purchases came at good prices and very fast sometimes even up to the house.(Without going to the post office)About Amazon salesI never sold there.But I heard a good friend of mine selling there.That the warehouse service is excellentAnd everything you store there in warehouses you get e-mail while it is sold.Which is a very convenient service.Regarding the Company's shares and the rate of growth.I bought the stock in the 900 and sold in the 1600 area.At its peak it reached $ 2000 per unit.I really think all the work for Jeff BezosAbout what he managed to create.RegardsAlon Fertig,2

"I received the wrong item from an Amazon purchase and returned it.  The total cost of the item was approx. $500.   I have returned purchases to Amazon many times and the returned funds have always posted against my Amazon credit card balance.  This time the credit posted to a non-existent Amazon gift card.  When returning the item, Amazon preselected “refund to your Amazon account balance”.  This in no way indicates it is returning the money to a non-existent gift card.  To add insult to injury purchases were posted against the gift card vs my Amazon credit card so they won’t refund the remaining gift card balance to my Amazon credit card!!  This seems to be entrapment, as Amazon’s messaging regarding where the funds are being returned to isn’t clear!  It seems Amazon is intentionally using vague language in their auto pre-selected option for returned funds to ensure customers spend the returned money through their company!  If this is unintentional, Amazon should add “gift card” to the auto pre-selected return funds option so customers understand the funds will not be returned to their Amazon credit card used to make the purchase, but instead be added to a non-existent gift card balance.  The gift card was created at the time of the refund!  As I stated above, this seems like financial entrapment to ensure returned funds remain with AMAZON vs being credited to the Amazon credit card used to make the purchase! I believe any reasonable person would assume “be returned to Amazon account balance” means being returned to your Amazon credit card balance.  Especially since at the time of the return there were no other Amazon account balances other than the credit card, there weren’t any gift cards on file, and every other refund processed through Amazon had been credited to my Amazon credit card balance. When “gift card” isn’t in the sentence of the pre-selected option, and Amazon has credit card options, it seems like it is an intentional action by Amazon to be vague in their messaging to entrap customer’s funds and ensure more funds are expended through Amazon!  I rarely write reviews, but felt people should know about Amazon’s ridiculous refund policy/messaging, as it could really cause harm to families already in financial distress due to the resent pandemic and resulting economic downturn.",0
I placed an order at 7am and I paid for same day delivery. I missed a call at 10pm. I suspected might be the shipment so I immediately clicked the link they sent by sms to track the order and I got that they were unable to reach me and now I have to go through the hassle of chasing my shipment and I’m traveling tonight. 10pm delivery??? I’m in bed at that time. Ridiculous service!!!,0
Great products and pricing. I once received a faulty product and it got replaced immediately,2
They don’t allow true reviews to be posted. If you had a bad experience they shut down your review. It’s pathetic that such a large corporation refuses to allow honest reviews.,0

"OK, package delivered on time",2
"I was offered a FREE 7 day, NO OBLIGATION trial of Amazon PRIME as I landed at the check out webpage. I opted in: ""sure why not says I""However after a day or so, I had buyer's remorse and choose to cancel my Amazon Prime membership. What happened next was disappointing:My item went missing for 10 days without a notification from the seller - who had shipped it - or Amazon PRIME - who had lost it! Reaching out to Amazon online, I asked what had happened to my purchase. Having been compelled to call Amazon, after a long wait, I opted for a call back. A very nice lady offered me a full refund. FYI, this option was not displayed to me online. ""Great ! thanks, yes please. Let's do that"". Guess what happened next? She sends the money back into my credit card account  and withing a couple of hours of it happily resting in my account - don't I get an email next day saying the product was being delivered!  It arrives; I print the RETURNS LABELS and stick them to the unopened box. Then I noticed that the Package required a STAMP, which turned out to be €9.00 So I found myself being put in a position of PAYING for accepting a NO OBLIGATION FREE TRAIL OF AMAZON PRIME 24-48 HOUR SHIPPING - should I RETURN a refunded order. Mmmm!?!OR alternately I am tacitly being invited to injure my personal integrity if I don't post the (now) unwanted item back to the shop who in fact had sold and shipped it in good faith. It seems to me that it ought to be the manager responsible for the online Free AMAZON PRIME trail promotion- who should be the individual sanctioned for making an offer s/he never intended to honor in word as well as spirit.  Shame on you Sir or Madam, no doubt on a lower wrung of the Regional management ladder, on your shifting your lack of integrity from yourself and onto the shop or the guileless customer you have out witted today. Are you proud of your interpretation of fair procedure of a dispute between a shop, a customer and Amazon Prime?",0

Very quick speedy delivery service and problems dealt with extremely quickly,2
"The drivers give no f*cks about doing their job correctly.  2 packages in 2 weeks stolen because the drivers don't read or can't read notes and numbers.  I've received 2 of my neighbors packages because they can't read the address numbers 2 feet above where they dropped the package or didn't want to walk to the back of my condo.  They did like to take pictures showing they didn't bother reading the notes for deliveries.  Next issue... John makes t shirts and sells them at $15 each.  Amazon says they'll buy all his tshirts at $5.  The stores he sold too can't get their supply because Amazon bought them all.  Amazon sells them online at $8 each your shop sold them at $16.  Your shop tried to make $1 profit.  John took a cut and probably a small loss that could put his production out of business.  Customers refuse to go to either one because they can get then cheaper on Amazon.  Don't buy Amazon!  Wal-Mart does the same thing but Amazon put john in bankrupty and then bought John's business for pennies.  You May want it cheaper but you're hurting small businesses for the convenience of ""1 day delivery""",0
My book is not showing on Amazon.Com but is on Amazon.UK.  I have repeatedly messaged Amazon about this but none of their advisors read my emails correctly. I have tried to raise a formal complaint by asking for details of their procedure / contact but these requests have also been ignored.  I have been disgusted by Amazon’s failure to address these issues.,0
You'd think with how simple it is to buy on Amazon they'd implement a similar system for sellers. Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!,1
I ordered 2 pair of support knee high hose because my legs were swelling and my doctor told me to get some support hose to wear and that would probably help my swelling. I called and got a representative to help me figure out what I needed. I can't remember his name but he was so nice and helped me decide what I needed. He helped me from the very beginning and to the end of my order. I couldn't of done it I don't think if he hadn't of helped me. I would order from them any time that I needed any  thing. There knee highs were very nice and they are working very good for me.,2
Great place to search for items and see what's available but the website needs filters to help your search - such as price filters to make searching for items easier,1
"Don’t you ever use Amazon in Germany! I don’t know if they have an extra sense off slacking off here or anything, but they haven’t even processed my goods for a month! They didn’t even leave a feedback about why this was happening. Let me guess, you sell goods that’s not even in your wares ? You are disgusting.",0
always the buy always the postage prices always quick delivery,2
Many of the venders are selling their items for more than you can purchase them from the manufacturer or other outlets like Walmart. Some of the sales look more like gouging.,1
Excellent service love them Always going to use them,2
Crappy company. Slow shipping. Over charging.,0
The prices on amazon.com are excellent. They ship things quickly and will reimburse someone for any mistakes they make. I’ve not a clue as to why anyone would rate this website lower than four stars.,2
Bad stance on pre-orders from Amazon UK.The whole point of pre-ordering games is to guarantee that hardcore gamers like myself get games as soon as possible.I pre ordered WWE 2K18 Deluxe Edition around a month in advance to get the pre-order bonus and mainly to get it 4 days early. It has not arrived and is now in limbo with regards to when I get it.Amazon's response? The game is unavailable and out of stock due to high demand and it'll take us 2-3 business days to give you a response from another department.Out of stock is supposed to be impossible when pre-ordering since they guarantee receipt of the game on release day.I eventually received £10 off at Amazon which is useful but does nothing for the integrity of a pre-order guarantee. This is the third time Amazon have failed to get a WWE game to me as per the pre-order guarantee.,0
"SHAME on you Amazon!!  I have a defective item that is outside the return window.  I asked for a FAIR credit on my account and your management, LEXI, refused AND she also wouldn't give me her boss's name (she said it was against policy).  I spend A LOT of money through AMAZON, including being a Prime member for a very long time..that spending will NOW STOP....I will be using a company that appreciates my business from now on!!",0
"We were given a voucher for over £200. We have tried ordering 2 tvs and a desk all at seperate times using our voucher. When complaining about it they first said the item was still coming and then weeks later said the item couldn’t be delivered. We asked for the money so we could spend it elsewhere and they said no, with no compensation. Essentially we have lost that money. If I had enough money or spare time I’d take legal proceedings.",0

Amazon overall deliver a acceptable support but it can fall down when some of its suppliers provide a very ordinary support. In my case I bought 3 cat Webbox  sticks from Staks and Co. They offered no return support. I paid £8.19which I had assumed  was for 3 X 3 packets of Webbox Cat sticks and so I paid £8.19. They sent me 3 so i paid £2.73 eachper  packet when they only cost £1.00 in Morrisons. Don't use Staks and Co unless you are very rich.   Oh and no returns.,1
"One world 'AVOID' their customer care are trained professional liers, I open a seller account, even when it was stated on their page that as an individual it totally free.

"Minus 5 🌟 to the guy who was pretending to be a delivery person Just had a parcel delivered from AMAZON. Had a text reminder saying it’s been delivered, yes it was but not in the safe place, I always get it delivered to which is in the porch at the bottom of the garden. Where was it delivered to? In the grass just inside the gate.I went up and caught the guy before he got in his van and I asked him why he didn’t knock on the door his ignorant answer was I didn’t want to disturb you. I asked if he thought that was funny he said whatever, I told the ignorant guy I’m reporting him he said whatever feel free. So is this the type of person AMAZON employ? No wonder they have a bad name. But do they care? Not while they are making billions in profits ",0

"Sadly, Amazon Prime is no longer Prime! My last 4 orders have not been delivered on time. It seems the Phonex facility doesn't care about On Time Deliveries. Plus they have a ordinary habit of losing packages. I know that Phonex is only 1.5 hours from Tucson and I know they make several stops along the way, but, if it takes a driver over 12 hours to make his trip, you need new drivers!",1
"Going, going gone. Customer service and their loyalty to the customer are a thing of the past.  Their people are spoiled little know-it-alls who are arrogant and actually know very little. Many Amazon representatives have very heavy accents, are difficult to understand, in many cases speaking broken English, lacking basic writing skills. This translates into people who cannot understand what you are calling about or how to help you. Amazon yet again ticked me off with more aggravating issues.  First was a problem with my Amazon 55"" Omni TV which recently started having additional software issues, this time with the picture setting Vivid. I called Amazon and explained the TV would not stay on the Vivid setting and kept going to Natural instead. This was never an issue in the past. Per their request I rebooted the TV, after, I unplugged the TV which still did not work. They then wanted me to reset the TV back to factory settings which I said I would not do as it would not fix the issue, the problem was on their end and that they needed to submit a ticket. The Amazon support person said they cannot until I reset the TV as requested. After over an hour, I advised I would just wait until someone else calls, then takes the hours to reset the TV for them to find out I was right. It only took two days for me to be proven right and the issue to be fixed. Next I wrote a product review for a shampoo and conditioner as follows, which was rejected by morons several times.Review: Title: Excellent product - highly recommend.Text: I developed a very itchy scalp from environmental allergies which was greatly exacerbated by another high end conditioner. Even when I stopped using it, the itch would not go away, even after several months. I read many reviews, found this conditioner along with the shampoo which was in a two pack. Love it. Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control. Both the Shampoo and Conditioner smell great. I did receive a card in the mail from the manufacturer stating I would receive a small gift for leaving a honest review which I would have done without it, so it was just an additional benefit. Tip: In my opinion the conditioner goes faster, so we buy at least a couple of the combination pack, and then an extra one or two of the conditioner.Amazons reply: Hello, Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the following guideline: -We don't allow content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others. ------ review you posted (as listed above) the line we rejected for is ""Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control."" Why we rejected ---1. Product work differently for every individual not same working for everyone.2. If you said it worked perfectly and we approved and if some another customer uses it and have harsh reactions , then that person will be in serious trouble.Note, my review is like millions of others giving their opinion. Amazon has dug in their heels. Their CEO and Executives are cowards who cannot and will not take the time to respond to the little people, instead their underpaid, low intelligence employees handle it. From this point on, purchasing from Amazon is only, and I mean only in on an emergency basis, such as for health issues where I cannot get the product anywhere else. From what I read I believe they already laid off around 10,000 employees, and I look forward to many more to come.  Amazon is very slowly becoming a thing of the past. A relative has Walmart+ and they are making inroads, getting better and better by the day. I will make sure to post my opinion on every website possible along with sending copies of the Amazon email to family and friends for a good laugh!",0

"I was trying to change my default credit card from Amazon Visa to another credit cared. The site would absolutely not do it. I called customer assistance and spent one-plus hours on the phone with an impatient, intolerant rep. going over and over the sites and selections I had already tried. It just would not let me enter an alternative credit card. Tonight, I found an agent who stayed with me and found a circuitous way for me to enter my new credit card. She was an angel; the rest of Amazon is an overbearing monopoly which I suspect just did not want me to use a credit card other than its.",1
"I gave a customer service rep access to both of my Kindle Fires due to a problem (that I later figured out wasn't actually related to Amazon) and he deleted a few hundred bookmarks.  4 phone calls later and I still haven't gotten them back. One person told that my only option was a  factory reset which I had been trying to avoid because it's a total PITA.  According to the settings menu this should have restored all of my data; it didn't.  The last person I spoke to told me that the info in the settings menu about factory resetting your Kindle is ""wrong."" He wasn't able to tell me why it was never addressed.  When I told him that when I purchased my second Kindle all of my bookmarks were downloaded from my backup, which means my info is stored somewhere, he told me my Kindle must be defective.  Oh. And this was supposedly a supervisor I was speaking to.  I've sent a registered letter off to their main office but am not expecting any response.",0

"The deliberate sale of defective merchandise, accompanied by an effort to shifting the burden of responsibility onto the purchaser is a criminal offense, this constitutes a fraudulent business practice. This scenario involves third-party sellers dispatching damaged products to buyers while the principal company, and Amazon is known foe its fraudulent business practices, it's  imperative that such entities are held accountable for their deceptive conduct, and consumers should be wary of engaging with companies that employ these unethical strategies. The liability for the defect and the associated return costs should unequivocally fall upon the seller or platform, not the buyer and as a buyer you have the right to refuse any  liability that's associated with afraudulent business practice and stop patronizing AMAZON until their policy is revised in consideration of all consumer laws and must benefit your interest as a consumer.Your foreign representatives are extremely disrespectful and unprofessional.

"I like shopping through Amazon but this last usage might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the shipment really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for shipment people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, shipment person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1

Don't usually do reviews but actually took the time to do. This is the 2nd time I have ordered something in the past month. It says that they have delivered it no they have not basically.

They always throw a few pounds sweetener or a free month of Prime membership. Occasionally I get to keep the wrong item I received - they refund it but ask me to NOT send it back.

"Overall, my interaction with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same item, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer assistance...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their items better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.",1

They could've rejected on the spot and I would've tried to sort it out immediately) This annoyed me because it defeats the purpose of me paying a premium for AmazonGlobal Expedited Shipping which values S$18.44. I shared my concern with Amazon customer support and they promptly waived my total shipping & handling fees of S$25.65 to S$0. I thought it was a courtesy talk-only customer service, but 5 minutes after the live chat ended, the change reflected. I was amazed.

"What Amazon has done to me and my grandson is disgusting. My grandson asked me for something for Christmas. I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it. Being 65 it's better I buy online then visit stores during Covid19. I received emails from Amazon 1.) on Dec 1st, order confirmation. 2.) on Dec 7th, my item has shipped and I should expect it by Dec 8th. After a few days waiting for item to arrive I started contacting Amazon. From one customer service (CS) rep to another rep, then supposedly one cs team leader to another cs team leader, I got the same answer they don't know what happened to my grandson's Christmas gift. They kept telling me that they can no longer give me my item I payed for and was told I would receive it proof of emails received by Amazon. I tried all over the web to find Amazon's Executive contact information. I called the executive office's where they would not give me any executive to talk to about my problem. I sent emails to a few executives but no answer as of yet, jeff at amazon being one of them. The only thing I can see is that when I purchased my item on Dec 1st it was selling for $129.99, now it up to $400.00. They must have seized my item to make more money selling it to someone else. How much more money does Jeff Bezos and Amazon want to make? So beware when Amazon screws you no one will help you.",0

You can see that there are 8% average reviews on an item but when you click on the 1 star review to see comments a notice pops up saying ""Sorry, no reviews match your current selections"".

"I really enjoy using Amazon for online shopping but the order drivers do NOT make the interaction worth it.

It's not even worth the hassel any more & thinking about cancelling my prime. They have excellent costumer assistance, but it's becoming a waste of money because of the driver's. So so sad",1
"Amazon is starting to remind me of that company Wish....if you get great stuff....AWESOME....if you get crappy stuff....Sorry for you!!! Amazon has its decent points, but overall it really lost its ""Touch""....don't get me started with Amazon Prime Shopping support....it started out strong....but now....it is just plain crap!!!! Expired, rotten, thawed, broken, and open items...are just the norm now....sad! I do not see a benefit Paying for Prime anymore....",1
"My moan is about the order support provided by their Enfield (North London) Delivery Depot.Amazon Tracking states that packages leave their depot around NOON, yes noon.Most of my orders are delivered to my local 'locker' which happens to be within a Post Office which, on a Saturday, closes at 3 pm!!!!! Should I have a order to home the drivers have a tendency to tap on the glass in and surrounding the front door (which rarely I can hear), why I have no idea because there are TWO working doorbells which would be impossible to miss.",1
"Many items that can not be found or are on back order I can find on Amazon.com. Most offer free shipping. Amazon.com is my ""go-to"" site when looking for most of all of my shopping online needs!",2
"I love the convenience of ordering online, however the order system for this company fails in many ways by having ""lazy"" order individuals deliver the goodss. I have had goodss wet, muddy, run over, and simply lost in a place not visible to retrieve them. This is an ongoing problem with Amazon. They need their own trucks and driver to eliminate this problem.",1
My son got a kindle fire kids tablet for Christmas from his aunt. I didnt have an amazon account before he got his tablet I had to set one up. His tablet broke after only 3 weeks and I figured with the 2 year warranty that came with the pad I could replace it. Well I contact amazon and they supposedly need a debit or credit card before they can process the warranty I dont have a debit or credit card and so they told me they couldn't replace the tablet. I will never order from Amazon this is a joke I cant get my kids Christmas present replaced just because I do t have a credit or debit card.,0
"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic goodss for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer assistance every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
"Have had mostly acceptable interactions You get what you pay for . However would advise them to go back to UPS  , Many packages delivered to the wrong address.They did issue me refunds .  ",1
"OK - not sure about their human rights ethics, but delivered my orders ok in my time of need",1
You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,1
Can't fault Amazon! Products are of good quality and speedy delivery. Always reliable as well and customer service is amazing. Would recommend to anyone!,2

"I was their prime member for years and i cancelled it because i dont get stuff i ordered on time. Prime member should get their ordered item within 2 days, ok lets say its delayed for 4 days.. but they have delayed every item i ordered for more then a week and there is no compensations for that. We are paying prime member for fast order. I THINK THEY MAKE most MONEY FROM PRIME MEMBERSHIPS. Otherwise they are decent.",1
Very slow with shipment. Amazon Prime is not a acceptable deal either.,1
Is it possible tu put less than 1 star ???? The customer service rep lied to my face telling me that my order was in advanced shipping and will definitely received my order tomorrow. Then less than 15 mn later my order was pushed back to 10 days later. And the answer from Amazon was if you bought Prime it will not happen. Oh my god is that BLACKMAIL?  But yes it is. Do not use them again. Please boycott them.,0
I have had great experiences with them for nearly a decade. My only complaint is that I wish they would pay their workers better wages.,2
"Take me 150 dollars by seller.amazon and do not want to refund, simply a rob.Never sell on Amazon, their systems are a mess.",0
"I have been an Amazon Prime member for at least 15 years and until the past 6 months to a year, I would have given Prime a 5-star review.  However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day shipment any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the support altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the support gets any worse.  I truly hate to see this happening because Amazon Prime has been a lifeline for me for years...my go-to when I needed something shipped to me fast and reliably.",1
They are ok they have a selection but they put parcels a5 random houses on my street I hate it .,1
"Excellent customer experience, products received as anticipated on all my orders so far.Only had positive experiences with there customer support, something that I cannot say about a lot of stores.",2

"Shop on Amazon once a week, give or take, never reviewed them.  Decided to review this time because I tried Taobao through a friend...  Now I realize Amazon is actually pretty awesome, lol",2
"Amazon Prime member for many years.  Getting very disillusioned with Prime order/promised order dates. Prime promises same day, next day, two day order depending upon the item you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some items due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all items can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised order vs. actual order issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the order date stated/selected when I order.  In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a item and get an HONEST, REALISTIC order date than continue to get notifications that the item I've ordered is delayed.  In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original order date.  Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.  In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.  Go figure...",1
I received my package with a delay of 2 days but it arrived safe covered by a fine packaging!,1
I love to buy amazon because they have the fastest shipping. Free amazon prime for students I use to ship all my stuff. I recently needed to get a lacrosse ball for practice and I got it so fast. Thank you amazon,2
"Received my item in the poorest state I’ve ever received in item in - product, box the product came in and the shipping box all broken and crushed. I contacted customer support and explained that I purchased it as a Father’s Day present and couldn’t afford to wait for a time to return myself and then wait for the refund to buy a new present. I also explained that my dad is in hospital and I was going to surprise him with the gift. Customer support was unsympathetic and condescending. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and got through to Omkar. Total waste of time. Not only did he just recycle the same washed out responses I’d already received (clearly copy and paste), he was unhelpful and condescending to my situation. Telling me “we will investigate this issue to make sure it doesn’t happen again”, how does that help in this particular situation? Baffled if I’m honest. Won’t be ordering again as the customer service and delivery is awful.",0

So last year I was looking for Christmas shirts saw a sparkly reindeer image shirt so I ordered it. Only it was a iron on decal. No problem I can apply it to a shirt.So I posted my review for it and Amazon messaged me saying they couldn't post my review... I posted that it was a Decal not a shirt. So I guess you can't let people know what the item really is... Or isn't,1

"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2
Received the nuts as a gift; there was no card inside to tell me who sent it. I have called multiple time with no answer or return call. Also left an email. The address is an Amazon distribution facility. How can I thank someone if there is no way to know who sent me the gift.,0
"Vulgar through and through next day delivery load of rubbish, was supposed to be here today got a delivery time scale then it changed to alater time scale, says neighbours get delivery's from amazon courier but skipped my address, contacted vulgar amazon customer services and all I got was wait till 10pm wait till 10pm waited few hours longer went back through to be fobbed off again u till I demanded to make an official complaint got another useless waste of space advisor, who initially tied saying that delivery was attempted at 2.11pm soon changed their tune on that when advised them I have cctv and can prive otherwise, he offered to compensate for the vile service with delivery and offered and a massive insulting £5 credit on my account of course i told them to keep it. Moral of this story is don't bother paying for prime as your don't get ypur spaces next day as it states, miss selling at it finest well I will be reporting them. Thieves avoid them and don't not invest in prime, u don't get what ypy pay for.",0

Normally I have no issue with Amazon. Sellers have been good. Fast shipping. But my last order. They have processed and cancelled the payment over 9 times. Spoke to Amazon they are less then helpful. Telling me it will go back in my account 5-10 days. Luckily my bank is great and issues me back the over charges leaving one pending to clear. But then the next day they put in 4 more. That makes my car insurance payment bounce. Go to the bank put in money to clear that payment. Bank again gives me my money back leaving one pending. This morning I wake up to 3 charges. Wft is wrong with Amazon. All you need is ONE authorization. Not 9. That’s over 1400.00 you have pending for a 164 payment. And there remedy is to offer a 10.00 Amazon GC. Really?!?!  Do better Amazon the worst customer service there is!!!!!!,0

"Ordered two items online from Zara- split into two shipments (both due the same day but by different couriers) totally unnecessary.Zara decided to trust Amazon Shipping to deliver one half of my shipment.First shipment arrived via Royal mail. Later that day I received an email the second shipment had been delivered to a neighbour even though I had not left the house all day. The second shipment was ‘delivered’ by Amazon Shipping. Delivered to a neighbour with no proof of delivery or address to collect from. Today, one week after ‘delivery’ I have been informed by a kind hearted stranger by parcel was delivered to them two days ago, at the other side of the town I live in.I now have to collect my parcel, from the other side of town. Isn’t this the job of a courier?Amazon Shipping are the worst courier, if they don’t leave your parcels out in the rain they falsely inform you of a delivery then a week later deliver it to the completely wrong address. Every time I order from Amazon, my parcel is undeliverable. Zara made a huge mistake trusting Amazon Shipping to fulfil their shipments as now I have no trust in Zara and feel even stronger about my dislike of Amazon Shipping!",0

"What a complete bunch of robbing gits, as a prime customer I agreed to free trial with kindle unlimited and amazon music. Both stipulated that they would send an email to me before my subscription renewal date. I then cancelled my prime account and now find they are charging me for auto renewal of my ""free trials"" absolute disgrace never give these people your payment details as they will rip you off anyway they can. Wish there was a zero star option",0
Amazon are not what they used to be.  NO customer service.  Prime is a joke cannot really see the benefit and the products appear sub standard compared to others on the market.Basically go elsewhere,0
"I ordered an item to be delivered in two days. It has not arrived.  I am leaving my destination on 12/31. I cannot sit around and wait for someone who may deliver a product that should have been here already. Their delivery continues to deteriorate. Packages are tossed over a railing, in plain view. That makes it easier to steal. Amazon use to be reliable.  We use them at least once a week. I may have to find a more reliable company.",0
The experience has always been great and I've never been disappointed with the orders that Amazon delivers themselves... here in a few days!,2

Quite a nuisance, so I did.. and my review was rejected as ""not in compliance"" all I noted was the item bought was ""OK"" but not as acceptable as others for same price. Political correctness? perhaps. If they don't want honest albeit free speech... appraisals then stop asking for my opinion.",1

you can always count on amazon,2
"The go to place for pretty much anything.I am a so called ""prime member"". Over the years their deliveries have gotten worse in my interaction and items were being sent out but delivered to the wrong places without any attempts being made to deliver to me first even though I was home.Customer support is actually pretty quick and reachable. Very customer centric but there are, at times, moments when you have to push your complaints further. For example for damaged items that no one comes to collect? Communication between them: make sure you check on the status of your complaints because sometimes they cannot update things properly and you may end up being charged for something you were supposed to return and no one came to collect so they told you to dispose of it.",1
Amazon is a great company but their goodss are quite expensive,1
"Spent over $600.00 for items for a small business. They sent only a partial package. Someone at the warehouse read the order wrong. Made several phone calls to C/S only to be told they cant help and cannot send entire order or cannot give me a refund, or would just hang up on me only for  having to call back again and talk to someone else and  explain the partial order again.  They claim it was stolen upon delivery. The package was directly handed to me so it wasnt stolen. Amazon wanted me to file a police report?? Someone packing at the warehouse messed up. They want me to return the partial package, Im still waiting for their return label. Almost 2 weeks. I filed a dispute with my credit card company, still waiting for results of my dispute. My next move will be to news channels,  BBB, the State attorney generals office, and anyone else out there that can either get me the rest of my order or get me a refund, or else I will be out over $600's. Ive shopped at Amazon alot over the years, well, never again and although Amazon is a huge company and maybe $600 isnt alot of money to them but its alot for me to lose. Sad, that, for a company like Amazon that they will not help with customer issues, but sure didnt hesitate to take my money. So, from now on I will do my shopping elsewhere.",0

"Amazon is the mother of all online marketplaces ... and for some very solid reasons.1. 100% customer-centered. From the first page loading on their site to the shipping confirmation, Amazon treats every customer like a VIP. Awesome!2. Adapts and evolves with customers' needs. Unafraid to charter new territory, Amazon evolves with the ever-changing needs of its customers.3. Delivers your package on-time OR early. This is such a game-changer that Amazon has seriously disrupted the US Postal Service due to their unmatched delivery system. I could easily write 10 more pages about why Amazon is #1, but it really boils down to this: customer service. In a time where true customer service has become a rarity, Amazon is the undisputed leader.",2

"I have a surgery scheduled for August 16th and need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before. I have been trying to order clear protein drinks for two weeks now, and Amazon has so far failed to deliver all of them. The first product was 5 days shipping and the day before delivery the shipper broke some of the bottles--not Amazon's fault, obviously. The problem was how Amazon handled it. When I called, they told me they communicated to the company to initiate the replacement now, so it could be delivered  by the following Saturday. By the next day I still did not see a status change on the Amazon app for the product, so I called again--I was told by the person that she ""guaranteed"" I would receive the replacement by Saturday. Saturday arrived and still no change in shipping status to indicate the item was shipped--in fact, the only update was to state I was receiving a refund--so I called Amazon again. The first agent lied to me and tried to tell me he could ""help"" by initiating a refund (the refund had already been initiated the day before). I had the call escalated and I was told the item was never replaced and that none of the agents should have told me what they did. It was also too late to order that item as new orders would arrive after the surgery date. I looked for a different clear protein drink (that isn't red or purple). By now the surgery was only a few days away. The item I found indicated it could be delivered same day, between 5 and 10 p.m. Eureka, I thought. I ordered it. Of course it didn't arrive. That night the app updated to say that it would be delivered by 8 a.m. the next day. It wasn't. I called Amazon again. This time they have no idea why the item wasn't delivered and they still had no idea if or when the item might be delivered today. I had the call escalated. She didn't know either. She also couldn't reach the area that handles shipping to find out when the item would be shipped. She ended up refunding the first item (while not canceling it) and recommending a new order be put in to try to get the item delivered by this afternoon--halfway through the clear liquids day. I did as she suggested and put the second order it, but I really have very little confidence  Amazon can make it happen anymore. Unfortunately, these are not the only examples of failed and late deliveries with this company. It's become commonplace. While I was on the phone with the escalation team, I submitted my order for the first items I am moving to Walmart and away from Amazon. I will find replacements for the rest of my items and then cancel Prime before the end of the month. For those who may be holding off on canceling Prime because you like the streaming, be aware that after you cancel you can pay for a streaming-only option for $9 a month--less than the $15 a month or so we pay for Prime shipping. If I find the streaming worth keeping (TBD), that is what I will switch to. The rest of the company isn't worth my hard-earned money anymore. Moving on.",0

"Amazon delivery is terrible. I used to get my packages in the morning or before 4pm when UPS, FEDEX, or my regular mail person would deliver them. Since they started delivering, some of my packages have been damaged as well.Now, when I track my package, it tells me it's close but it doesnt end up coming for 4 or 5 more hours, while spending 2-3 of those hours, sitting in one place.I'd rather cancel my subscription with Amazon and buy off of another website and get my package before 8 or 9pm. HIGHLY DISSATISFIED",0
I have been purchasing regularly from Amazon since last two years and found only tolerable petty mistakes untill today when I came to know about the blunders Amazon do. I had ordered a carpet through Amazon making advance payment and the order was successfully placed and the advance money was debited from my account but to my surprise after two hours the order got cancelled by itself and the money was refunded. When asked to Amazon customer service they said the order was cancelled by the seller saying that the price quoted was wrong. I didn't know that Amazon only supports the sellers and not the buyers. How could someone quote less on an online portal and Amazon supports them blindly not holding them responsible for their mistakes. This is very sad and made me unhappy.Chennai- India,0

Great service Amazon! I've been a prime member for a while now and I'm seriously considering cancelling my subscription with them. The calibre of staff is decreasing, I had an Amazon delivery posted through my letter box the week before, which was intended for the floor above me.

"Honestly, I had purchased on Amazon before and I never had problems with any of my orders. But recently, I decided to purchase shoes on Amazon and I had the most stressful experience. When I ordered my shoes, I kept tracking it and everything was going well and I liked how Amazon always tells you when your shipment will arrive. On the day my shipment was suppose to arrive, i checked my tracking information and it said it was being sent back to seller with no explanation. When I reached out to the seller he explained to me he didn't know why either and that id receive a refud. I was very annoyed and confused but I gave amazon another chance because like I said before, I have had good experiences with Amazon. So I decided to just purchase the same shoes from another seller on Amazon and when I did everything was going well until on the day the shipment was suppose to arrive AGAIN. On this day, I logged on to check my tracking info and it said UPS was unable to deliver my package. I contacted an Amazon Agent and they told me that my address was incomplete and I needed to contact UPS to complete it. Mind you my product was delivered and at a UPS near me. When I contacted UPS to complete my address they told me that it was a huge change of address if I completed it,So UPS told me to contact Amazon to complete the address. when I spoke to another Amazon Agent they said they couldn't complete my address either because the carrier had the product. At this point I'm calling UPS and Amazon back and forth to complete my address and no one can do it. Finally UPS told me I could pick it up at the UPS ware house but I needed an ID. And I couldn't pick it up because I always use a Nickname online shopping. If Amazon could have told me my address was incomplete as soon as I purchased my product, I would not have gone through all of this. That was the most stressful online experience I've ever had at that point I just canceled my order.",0

"Amazon works well if things are standard.  However, the moment an issue becomes non-standard, you enter customer support hell.  I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.",1
Love the assistance. Shipping can be improved.,1
"Five stars all the way! I couldn't be happier with my purchase from Amazon. The product arrived promptly, well-packaged, and exactly as described. I highly recommend shopping on Amazon for all your needs!",2
Constantly requested reorder of my item and my request was ignored time and time again. My mop arrived 6 days later than planned. Once it came I was very happy with it though so worth the wait.,1
"Usually, everything works fine. If something gets wrong they fix it quickly. Best customer service I've seen, ever !Just don't buy things not shipped BY amazon",2
"We use amazon prime regularly. Before we ordered it gave us next day delivery, so we placed our order. Then we received an email saying it would be five days. If we cancelled the order it would take 7-10 days before our refund. Absolutely ridiculous, they haven't even got a customer complaints department  to deal with. Order at your peril",0
... but overall one of my favorite online shops. I guess there is not much you cannot get there.,2
"The Amazon customer service from the Philippines is so bad that once I finally get my overdue refund for an item I never received, I will be cancelling my Amazon account. Completely useless and unknowledgeable staff.",0
"I have ordered lots of times from Amazon and they have mostly been great, love the quick deliveries and choices. The area they really do need to improve on is customer support when things dont go quite right. I recently ordered 3 items, had an email to say they had been delivered and left in the garden, well not my garden. I telephoned, sent messages to live chat as you cannot reply to their emails. No customer support really, just said it would be investigated, but no updates at all. The packages were left in a completely different cul-de-sac, luckily the lady brought them round to us. But nothing from Amazon to ensure we had received our deliveries. Let's you down averagely I'm afraid.",1
"This is a second review I am writing for Amazon, in order to clarify their biased reviews filtering and complete lack of transparency in regard to users' opinions showing various goods defects.I have attempted to publish a review regarding the dysfonctionality of Victron Energy MPPT 75 15 BT device. Three times. With video pointing the defect. None of the three attempts were ever published and no feedback was returned to me regarding the potential reasons for refusal. ",1
"Its amazon, the best :"")",2
"i decided to stop to buy there because of 3 purchase that i make and no item no money back and no reply from them, and every time i want to put a average review do not get posted posted",1
It's really hard to return items I almost rather take the loss on the average purchase,1
I have being shopping at Amazon from about 2005 and never had a problem with my package.Once I ordered and my item was the wrong size sent and contact them and it was rectified easily.IOn another occassion I bought an item and I did not get it and they re sent another.No hassle.I will continue shopping Amazon.PLEASE READERS DO NOT SHOP CHARLOTTE RUSSE..THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!,2
This is a fine app to buy stuff from but I order something and it said it would come today but it never came.,1
i bought a slave from here and he lived for over two years!!!,2
"I always use Amazon to do my online shopping, they are just great. The website is user friendly, they have a great selection of articles, very reliable, and I feel safe shopping with them.",2
"I am writing both as a user of their products and also someone who has more than an inkling of ""how to be a professional seller"".   Amazon has never not met my needs. Always professional, always there. Especially helpful to seniors and avid reader and authors.  Definitely from my involvement with Amazon it is a 5 star Company!",2
I'm somewhat ashamed to admit it but Amazon has become the glue that keeps my life together. Their quick delivery has gotten me out of too many tricky situations on multiple occasions...,2
"amazon is a wonder company. I can get clothes that I would normally get imported from amazon. Plus I have prime, so I receive them is two days.",2
Good for the most part but customer support can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon item or 3rd party seller,1
Delivered on time but usually just dump it on doorstep,1
"Amazon is the best company i have ever used, trusted / fast / reliable / and efficient , has absolutely everything you want. Always use it and will remain to use it for future use. Thanks alot",2
"""Amazon has truly revolutionized the way we shop online. The platform offers an incredible variety of items, from everyday essentials to niche items that are hard to find elsewhere. The user-friendly website and app make browsing and purchasing a breeze. With features like one-click ordering and Prime membership benefits, such as fast shipping and access to streaming content, Amazon has set a high standard for convenience. However, sometimes the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, and there have been concerns about the treatment of workers in their warehouses. Overall, Amazon remains a go-to destination for shopping, providing a seamless interaction for customers worldwide.""",1

Option for shipment i use Amazon on a regular basis I like them except they don't give you an option on who you want to to ship your goodss it's simple you pick your shipping company at check out 3rd time I've recommend this thanks,1
Great as always thank you,2
"I have had a relationship with Amazon from when it was first mentioned in the Wall Street Journal as a small startup company selling books.  Now I order something at least several times a month, usually more often.  It is my first shopping choice, whether online or off. Whenever I have had a question about something and have emailed them, I get a quick response.  I love the free shipping for orders over $25 so always take advantage of that.  Service is excellent.  Product always what it says it is.  As far as I am concerned, it started the online shopping and still is the best there is.",2
Bye Amazon. Didnt use a lot 5-8 times a year. I dont deal with unethical companies such as yours.,0

"I've been a Prime member for many years. It's not perfect but I find Customer support is quick to resolve missed deadlines and defective acceptables. My only complaint is a lot of sellers are selling expired acceptables. So my advice is to check the dates on everything and contact customer support if you've received old goodss. It's true some reps are difficult to deal with but just keep escalating until you get results.Prime Video is another issue altogether. I refuse to pay extra fees for ""no commercials""This is a ridiculous money grab since a lot of content you can get for free on other non subscription channels.The above reasons are why I'm giving Amazon a 3 star rating. IMO they can do better!",1
I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer assistance levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the assistance on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
"I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.",1
How are you I have a small business and I tried to list item for sale on Amazon it was big scam start from the  beginning you have to buy a barcode from company they deal with them Gs1 cost $250 for barcode to list an item you have to go through a lot of Hustle and unwelcome website and if you need help some agent from India or Philippine going to call you back after you send request email because no phone number to call but anyway I finished everything they say  provide them With my tax ID number and it's still not working I don't know why I believe they have the most stupid system in the world now to sell on Amazon you need to ship your product to their warehouse which required another company they provided to come and pick up your shipment which cost me a lot of money and another 10 days waiting with three different appointment and they never show finally they come add pick up my shipment and it's been 8 days and I don't know where is my product so stay away if you want to sell on Amazon stay away,0

"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I initiated a return for refund. The next day UPS picked the item up and delivered it to Amazon the following day! I go into check the status on Amazons website and it just states that a return was requested. Now 2 weeks later their website has the same status! I’ve contacted customer service 4 times and get nowhere with them! I should be seeing and updated status, per their policy, and received an email, per their policy, by now, stating the refund process has begun, but I have received nothing but lip service and no refund! Now they are forcing me to file a complaint through Visa to get my refund! TERRIBLE way to treat a good customer!",0
Find amazon to be fine but I have prime and next day shipment but even when its listed as next day shipment I didn't get it next day was apposed to recive item today but instead its coming another day  I have checked to make sure item was prime shipment and it is this has happened few times,1
I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1
"I purchased a $10 CPU cooler, the seller was Amazon themselves. I should've gotten the fan itself, thermal paste & backplate, but all I got is the fan.I was suspicious the second I realized I just got a fan, but I thought, maybe it's supposed to be like that (it's not) and then I applied thermal paste on my cpu, and tried screwing the cpu cooler down, but it didn't work. I need the backplate to screw it down.There is no option to actually contact support, I can either get my money back or a new product, both options require I send the product back. I do not get compensated for the expensive thermal paste of my own that I used.I'm writing this part a while later, I have sent the package back to where it came from, you can check on dhl.se this number 7135563356I also have a receipt where it said I'm returning this from DHLThey took a while to update anything, for the first nine days, it said I haven't even dropped of my package yet but I have. I got my money the next day.Don't give Amazon the benefit of the doubt like I did, just buy from websites with convinient money back policies. I told the manufacturers about Amazon too.What should Amazon have done: Send either a whole product, the missing parts, or give me my money back, without requiring me to ship the item back.",0
"I've been an Amazon prime user for years and this year I decided to cancel this subscription, in this month I've been through hell, between lost packages and packages that don't arrive despite paying to have the package on time.

"+can buy items you can't buy locally+if you have a prime membership prime video is ok'ish and sometimes fine.-prices usually 2x to 10x, and sometimes even 100x the going retail value-Defective items other people have returned are resold as new while still defective-Products that are only supposed to only be sold sealed and sterile are resold open and unsterile after people have returned them.-Amazon sometimes prevents critical reviews such as when I bought a Amazon's Choice dash cam and wished to make a mixed review (it was super inexpensive but also had flaws like the image being flipped so it looked like you were driving in England instead of america.) but when trying to review i get the message:""Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this item. Due to this activity, we have limited this item to verified purchase reviews.""despite it being a verified purchase of mine",1
I have been an Amazon Prime member since 2013 and I have NEVER had an issue with any of my deliveries (and there have been MANY!) I definitely give them 5 stars!!,2
My Account got compromised as someone hacked  my account and I noticed it within a few hours since I was going to purchase a few items-I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident as money was withdrawn from my Amazon Gift Card and my Virtual card which I had on my account- which was gifted to me.-I have been calling everyday for the past 6 days and I get the same answer -we are investigating and will get back to you in 24hrs-but no response is ever received-so I suggest stay away from buying Amazon gift cards and using Virtual cards as there is no support from Amazon and the responsibility and risk is totally yours. Amazon is good as long as there are no complicated issue or Fraud-I even asked them if I could speak to the fraud Dept. but they said I could not. Not sure if they have a Fraud  deptt.,0
"Fake reviews, fake goodss which are not supposed to be there on Amazon, but there they are. I used to buy from Amazon every week, their quality have become worthless recent years",1
i always order in amazon and it all went decent.,1
Buyer beware!! Be aware that Amazon returns that show when you are making a purchase that it will be free is an untrue statement. The free return is nothing more than a shipping label or QR code. Amazon has found a way to charge for returns and hit the purchaser with a restocking fee even if an item is an absolutely perfect condition. So ultimately your refund is less than your purchase price and Amazon doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. I have to believe that Amazon got as big as they did as quick as they did by doing nothing more than take unnecessary money from the common people who can literally not afford to be charged undisclosed fees. The practice of saying free shipping and free returns is not what they are providing so that is either bait and switch or certainly unethical.,0
"Don't order an Xbox from Amazon. They will send you the wrong item. It's happened to me, and it happened to a friend. I asked for a replacement which they said they would do; then another 'Amazon team' decided they couldn't. Another annoying thing if you want customer service on android, don't bother. The keyboard covers what you are typing on android, making it impossible to type. The only saving grace is they gave me a refund quickly. But this sort of thing shouldn't happen",0
"I use amazon for years now and never had any issues, I always found customer support very acceptable. However this time everything changed. I ordered a little balance bike for my sons birthday specifically. Was waiting for over a week for it to be dispatched but noticed nothing was happening. I contacted amazon to check up on it the day beforw it was due to arrive and they send me an email that my order was cancelled due to stock availability. When I ordered the bike it was in stock so how can they sell items that are not in stock?!!  Also if there was an issue like that that could of informed me so I could shop elsewhere. If it wasn’t me chasing them I don’t even know if they would of let me know at all!!! I contacted them again and it didn’t feel like they cared at all. I do understand current circumstances but you just can’t put smth out for sale when it’s not in stock?!?! Now I ended up having no gift for my sons birthday. Never was So disappointed tbh. It sucks.",1
I wish I could rate of zero I’ve had those experience with Amazon! The customer service representatives do not understand English most of them are overseas. Manager was totally belligerent has no empathy for anything I waited over 10 hours for UPS to come pick up the package and all she did was cancel my return expecting me to wait another day at home with no resolution,0
think 'we' should post a review based on our experiences over time (ANY THING ELSE IS JUST NOT FAIR).......,2
"I had a problem with an item, that I had purchased, that quit working after 2 weeks. Amazon had UPS pick up the item the next business day and they paid for the return. I have never had a company listen to me, like this before, about a purchase. I had a refund within a few days. I have been purchasing items from Amazon for years, but this was the first time I had such a problem. They have been wonderful to order from in the past, but now, I feel much more confident ordering items. I will purchase from them more now then in the past.",2

"I paid for prime to have my product shipped quickly. They had no problem charging me for shipping immediately... however it did not say “pay from prime” it said “free shipping”As the arrival date was inching closer the product still has not shipped, I reached out and the response was they have express delivery, it would be there in 24hrs. But I was welcome to cancel my order and buy locally.I receive Amazon gift cards as a form of payment at times and was using one. I asked for further instructions in doing so with no response, in fact I have emailed 3 times since then with no response. It showed that delivery could be as late as 10pm! I’m usually up early for work I had said anything after 6pm is inappropriate as I would be in bed. No response. No product came Monday either! Which is exactly what I was stressing for as this was for work! No product or response all week as I reached out wondering where it was and why they had gone through with the payment rather than reach out about how to buy this locally with my Amazon card (yea I realize this is impossible but it was their suggestion)I received my package at the end of the work week, Friday night and after 6pm no less. They showed me that my money and my business is of no concern to them. They may see gift cards as money already in the pocket but it is up to me to accept those gift cards or not. Which I will no longer be doing. This is the last disappointment I will be going through due to shopping with Amazon... oh yea, they have a warehouse one town over.. so it should have been smooth sailing. BYE AMAZON",0
"The ad title was: Yale safety padlock, pack of 6. Seller: Amazon SL. I did the purchase (order #408-0693583-5694705), next day I received just 1. Talked to the ""Customer Service"" and they said they couldn't do anything about it. Since when Amazon needs fraud to survive? (Aug 8, 2020)",0
"I am an Amazon junkie! I love Amazon! The customer service is great, return policy is great, and you can’t beat the deliver! I barely shop anywhere else! What I would like to see Amazon do is to open their own “Home depot” physical store. I flip homes so I spend thousands per year at the big box, but their delivery is the worst I’ve ever experienced. I get materials from China faster than HD can deliver. I know If Besos was running the show I would have my materials on time! Think about it Jeff! Cha Ching$$$$",2
Love Amazon using for years never disappointed,2
"Not legitI've tried ordering twice using different bank accounts, and both times got banned. Even after providing all of the documents and proof as requested, they still chose to close my account without explanation. Support is non-existent, and so is any contact info. So don't even bother, this whole place is just one massive scam.",0
"Amazon used to be a great site, but between the consistent fulfillment issues (sellers often listing products as being multi-packs with associated pricing and then sending a single item) and the slow, intentionally difficult to navigate customer service options I'm one more incident away from just cancelling Prime finally after being a subscriber for well over a decade.",0
"I love ordering from Amazon - and even when I've had a problem, they take care of it right away.  Amazing company.",2
"Amazon Prime: I bought a hedge trimmer from Amazon, unbeknown to me there was a 30 day trail period for Amazon Prime, something I neither asked for nor wanted, I have just discovered they have been taking money from my bank account every month since, without my permission or without me knowingly agreeing to this. The only way I found out was when I changed bank cards and they were trying to withdraw from the new one. I looked on there web site in order to stop this, no help whatsoever. Utterly disgusted and will never use them again. Please check your bank accounts to see if Amazon are stealing from you too.",0
Normally I’m happy with Amazon. They deliver fast and have a wide variety of choice. Prices are not always very competitive though. What really sucks is the customer supports. Everything is standardized. No room for a personal touch. Today I received a toaster but It’s been used but the only thing I can do is send it back.  I would never buy something electronically. I guess you can’t trust their suppliers,1
Love amazon period!,2
"Scammers. They transferring me 5 times, i spend 2 hours, and the end they did not get my money back because they transefrred me to Amazon Canada, my order was in Amazon US",1
Managed to sort out my refund for a product quickly,2
"Amazon email notified 'item posted through letterbox' - the item has probably been stolen from the doorstep - 2nd time this has happened in 2 weeks because the driver did not follow the delivery instructions. My main complaint is that the whole Amazon system is run by some kind of AI where, if your complaint doesn't fit their 10 item criteria it is not possible to post the complaint and the customer simply goes round in circles. The 'chat with assistant' and 'request a telephone call' options are just as bad - there is no option in the list to report that although the tracking email states ' posted through letterbox' in some cases this is a downright lie! Have spent thousands of pound a year with them for 6 years or so but if the delivery situation doesn't improve fast I'll switch to other suppliers. Here's an idea Amazon - employ some human beings to deal with complaints!",0
placed an order with amazon and got my order 3 weeks later very slow shipping,1
"I love Amazon. I subscribe to Amazon Prime and the two-day shipping saves me time after time. I don't depend on Amazon to always have the best price for everything--I am a researcher and I always shop around!--but Amazon almost always has the product I'm searching for. Instant Video is a plus, too!",2
My go to site for most things.  Love the Prime feature and the fast delivery.,2
"delivery is so so quick, Products a tad expensive but worth it for delivery speed",2
I have been an Amazon Prime member since 2013 and I have NEVER had an issue with any of my deliveries (and there have been MANY!) I definitely give them 5 stars!!,2
"on shipment time. When I order sometime for one day shipment I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of interactions with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only decent thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1
"I'm a seller. Amazon gives refunds to buyers without a return. All any buyer has to do is say they are dissatisfied, call Scamazon, say they want a refund. Bam, the buyer gets a refund and the product. There are better sales channels out there, look for emerging sales channels. This site NEVER, EVER decides in favor of the seller.",0
"I've been an Amazon Prime customer for several years. I've been extremely pleased up to 3 weeks ago. It seems that when they went to their own order system and started to promise 1 day deliveries, that the issues have happened. Several item have been lost in shipping.At least 1 of the items was bought and fulfilled by Amazon. 1st item got lost, I got a refund because item was no longer available,and ordered a similar item. 2nd item got lost. Called customer assistance which issued a re-shipping order which did nothing. After several more days I got on their help center.Went through 4 customer assistance people. At that point I was so disgusted that I told them I lost faith in the system. They recommend that I order from a different vendor at $10.00 more for the same item and that they would pay the expedited shipping. I told them that the $10.00 more was the expedited shipping cost and that I did not feel that I should pay for their problem. They said when I get my item, I should ask for a refund of the difference. We'll see how it works out.Later,I did order the other part and did contact them once I received it. I also copied and pasted from the previous chat that I had saved so it was per their instructions being fed back to them. They not only issued a refund but also refunded the whole amount of the purchase. I guess they knew I was upset. I think I'm back on track with them.",1
Amazon needs to stop jacking up prices because a 8 dollar thing becomes popular and over night it almost 20 dollars. And forcing customers to purchase a certain amount before taking them to the check out screen. Not cool. You are getting greedy,1
"This is the first time when I have such experience with you, I have an ordered on 11th dec the delivery date was on 19th dec although, without delivering the product got message of successful delivery so, called customer care and asked the reason not to deliver my product she replied it was just technical glitch due to which it happened and also assured to me will be delivered till 24th dec. It's 27th dec now but, didn't receive yet. Now, My order isn't showing under the section orders have all the payment details with me if I didn't get call then I am compelled to file a case in consumer court.",0
"Sent the wrong item repeatably and did nothing to resolve the issue, except ask me to return the item at my expense, useless incompetent staff.",0
amazon are not as ordinary but things you get off them are cheap at times and not the right colour and at great standards and i wont not use this website alot as i ordered screen protectors off it and they were terrible and order charging case and look every cheap and did not charge,1
Brilliant next day delivery service with plenty of variety to choose from no matter what your looking for,2
"Amazon's onboarding process as a potential seller is horrible! For a couple months I have been trying to list items. Amazon has sent me emails numerous times that my account is verified and I am ready to list.However, when I try to list (via adding a product not sold on Amazon) I get this, ""Problem with your Seller AccountYou’re currently unable to add or edit listings because either the credit card on file is invalid or the credit card is in the process of validating, which could take up to 24 hours. Please ensure that you have a valid credit card uploaded in Account Settings.""I have quadruple checked my credit card info matches my legal identity. That everything matches up 100%. Not only that I use this card on a daily basis. I also use it with my Amazon prime account (under the same account) often! But, am considering dropping my prime account based on this experience.I keep getting canned responses that don't help and have requested phone calls more than once and not received one.Absolutely horrible!",0
"Their customer service application on their website is absolutely dire, none existent. There is no customer service application that is fit for purpose apart from a list that you can click on which is almost worthless; no customer services phone number, no customer services email you can actually engage with that is directly on there site, no complaints platform you can actually use. This company has ballooned into a monstrous entity that it has forgotten about customer services completely. They have ditched the core principles that the ""Customer is King"" and the ""Customer is the life blood of your business"". I'm starting to go off buying Amazon shopping because there is no proper avenue to give your grievance to, no proper customer service you can ask for help. Amazon doesn't care about (us) their customers'. Recent experiences using Amazon shopping on line has left me very frustrated with their systems. I ordered goods from them to arrive at an Amazon pick up hub, they send me a code to open the hub locker but it won't open. I spent 3 days trying to open it. What was worse I couldn't contact an Amazon services customer advisor because there isn't one, just a computer offering basic general questions that couldn't answer what I wanted answering. If I had a telephone number or an email then that would of helped my frustration but instead I'm left there standing frustrated that I had no idea why I couldn't access the hub and my parcels. But hey let's talk about global warming shall we! Now a van has to pick up my parcel send it back to the depot, then as I THINK about reordering my parcel another van has to pollute the air twice to get it to me; so much for Amazon's environmental policy well that is just a joke. Come on Amazon get a grip with customer services, stop making US the customers do all your dirty work and stop adding vehicle fumes to the environment unnecessarily transporting parcels back and forth when a customer services team can help reduce that problem. Very poor customer services. I'm shopping more and more on the high Street because I'm increasingly becoming more frustrated with Amazon shopping experiences.",0
I’d give 10 stars if I could!  Fantastic service and quick delivery,2

"Company accepted payment for multiple orders, taking payment and decided afterwards to suspend orders to verify payment details. Customer service worker advised me to open a new account with UK phone number & this ended in the same situation.Refused to cancel orders or provide any evidence/record/reference number of requests to cancel/refund.Company's practice borders on illegal activity, which is not surprising as Amazon benefits form modern day slavery.",0
Really happy with items purchased. Thank you.,2
"Placed order which was shipped with Amazon Prime with a scheduled delivery date of 2/10/2021. I rearranged my schedule so that I would be home to accept the delivery. On the evening of 2/9/2021 I checked my Amazon account and found that Amazon had changed the delivery date to Friday 2/12/2021 without notifying me. I immediately contacted Amazon Customer Service, but they were not willing to fix or provide compensation since I would now have to rearrange my Friday schedule to be home to accept the delivery. I submitted a BBB complaint, but the Amazon BBB representative refused it. Amazon Customer Service is just about as bad as Comcast.",0
"I have no direct complaint about the supervisor who didn't help me with my situation, as I'm sure the calls he makes are out of Amazons master play book written by the executivesAmazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓) he works for. I would have liked Amazon to follow through with their guaranteed shipment date, but this man would not follow through. As I am driven by principle of the matter, I feel its false advertisement to guarantee something that can not be followed through on. It would seem to me, that it would be wise to change the pronoun guaranteed to expected, to sway people from ordering things they need by a certain date.",1
Wow this company is getting greedy. The delivery has increased amd now you have to get £35 worth if crap made In China to get free delivery. I have deleted my account . I will shop locally and support local shops. ,0
Prices are getting higher compared to a few years ago.Shipping seems to have gotten faster though,1
It's really hard to return items I almost rather take the loss on the average purchase,1
"Shopping on this platform is very convenient, it has all the items I want, and there are many choices.",2
Customer service has sadly been degrading steadily by the day.,0
I have been shopping at Amazon for a while now and they're so great they have good prices I have never had no problem I have never had nothing back and I will shop there in the future thank you and have a great day,2
decent. swift order also,1
"Some of my orders have never arrived, from different shops and different items. It’s the fourth time in 2 months. I get an email saying that the parcel was delivered, and the status of my order says delivered, however I never received it. I tried a different address and the same happened. Amazon provided me with refund, but it’s being a hassle to buy a item I need and wait for it, when it doesn’t arrive I have to call them just to find out I will not get what I was expecting.",1
"Amazon has delivered to the wrong location numerous amounts of times and even though I am a Prime member, it rarely gets here on the day promised.",1
"Order 4 tires February 5th 2023, only 3 shipped, got 1 ture refunded. Been trying to get the other 3 picked up from the installers address it's now March 31, 2023. Amazon says they are waiting forr them to be picked. Meanwhile they refuse to refund my 577.38.",0
Purchase many items from this site.,2
The customer service representative was an absolute jerk. Gave me so much attitude it was insane. For a multi billion dollar company its rubbish.,0
"I have always trusted Anazon but things went badly wrong yesterday. I have a disability so ordering online is a boon.  I have a collapsing spine and had a bad fall last week causing large bruises down the right leg and bruising to the c spine and lumber spine. I ordered 3 tubes of arnicare cream to help the bruising.  I watched on the app last night as the delivery drew nearer. It was dark but I could see it was parked up. Within minutes it had disappeared and a message put up that it had been put through the letterbox.The complex where I live does not have letterboxes. It has a secure entrance and delivery people press the appropriate flat number and access is given by the occupier. This person didn't even bother to walk to the residence.  I was waiting at the door to receive the parcel with 3 other people with me waiting to see where the Amazon guy was. Whoever he is he LIED. At first Amazon said it would be delivered by 9am today and then they said if it hadnt arrived by tomorrow to get back in touch. As I have battled all week with non delivery and false claim of delivery by Evri, I am at a loss. I am frustrated to say the least and do not expect this of Amazon",0
"Amazon's customer assistance was incredibly frustrating... I had to wait for hours, and when I finally spoke to a representative, they were unhelpful and dismissive of my concerns. It was a disappointing usage that left me with a sour impression of their assistance.",1
"I have bought many things through amazon with most being delivered. However, I would not buy something if it is not specified to be sold and dispatched from amazon as both times I have the item was never delivered. Customer support is horrible, I was repeatedly told my order was going to arrive and I should wait then eventually told that I was no longer able to get a refund.",1
Amazing product and fast delivery. I've already purchased thru amazon many times and always had great service.,2

"You generally find what you need but after you go through the whole procedure of entering details etc, you get the statement that item cannot be shipped to your country. This should be in the item description so as to avoid waste of time and disappointment.",1
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"Ordered an item and they said delivered to a resident. Husband knocked every door in our street.......nowhere to be found.Contacted amazon, which is a nightmare trying to do.....the automated responses said would deliver today, site showed delivered to a neighbour in no 4, it was not. Went back on to amazon.....automated again, that said a mistake and will be delivered in 3 days.....absolutely shocking and unbelievable, and very frustrating.Amazon you are worse than useless",0
While the convenience of having things shipped to the house in a two day span for free(Prime--on some items) (a lot of disclaimers here) but when they are obviously trying to compete and raise prices on things you can get cheaper else where. Eh. I'd rather go to the store and get it then wait 2 days and pay more. The appeal isnt there anymore when youre not pricing competitively. Oh and the few times ive had issues they customer assistance treats you like a criminal/scam artist so yeah. Eh. I do it if its easier or cheaper but not my go to.,1
I am always very pleased with Amazon and shop here often,2
But I don't use it,1

I use Amazon very often and I really enjoy it. I enjoy their fast shipping and have also used the site to find smaller shops that I have never heard about before. I will alwasy recommend Amazon.com,2
Legit scam. Took $79 out of my bank at random without any email or pre-warning stay away from these guys!,0
Can you justify why they’re several of your current employees that think it’s ok to attack customers outside their own homes or people being attacked on the street by your employees merely for asking if they need help. Also how can you justify that you used to adervtise the sale of sex dolls based on the appearance of children,0
"VERY BAD, VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICEI Ordered a mobile phone worth about Rs. 8893.00 on or about 21/8/23, and made payment through ICICI net banking but Amazon declined the payment where bank deducted the money from my account, The phone I got stolen by a thief in (INDIA) so needed a phone, Now I lost money no phone. I contact amazon they say I download the app, without a phone How can I download app to call, I AM WITH OUT A PHONE MONEY LOST.",0

"Amazon start sending items in the right size boxes, Penny pinching & making gifts look like they have been kept in the garage for 10 years, waited for a delivery for 8 days & I agreed to return, waited another week for replacement & it’s exactly the same, shopping online conveniences should have to include printing return labels & wasted petrol because you are penny pinching on boxes & postage 🤬",0
So easy to use and you can get anything on it.,2
"Everytime i order, always comes on time, always sold at a brilliant price, saves shipping and payment details so it's always spot on with no hassle!",2
Makes me return goodss in order to get a refund,1
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their support, their items and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer support representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
"Bad, I have amazon prime and they suck, I have ordered a few items from them no issues however I've only had this account TWO Months and my account is hacked. Someone changed my password and amazon locked me out so I called and they told me my billing address was wrong and they can't get into my account without it. So I then asked fine will you at least take my credit card information off you're records and they told me no. I recently ordered a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and never received it or my money back. They are not willing to help me with any of my issues, I wont use them again",0
"They were good but nowadays they are joking. There are many options for us to shop, we just need to spend some time to find the right store or site. As customers our laziness made Amazon as a big company, it is not about their product or services. The painful experience you will get from Amazon is when your item is not shipped on time or received damaged items. As they already moved to technologies business like AWS, Alexa, they don’t care about their e-commerce business. This company will go down if they operate their e-commerce business like this & that will also happen only because of customers like us.",0
Bought from amazon multiple times and have loved it every single time! Revolutionised online shopping for me,2

Fast delivery order really appreciate your quick delivery within two working day it was recieved today.. Thank you,2
"I would give 5 stars and here’s why I’m not. I’ve been using amazon for several years now and they have been great! Especially with prime. Now, here recently they have started delivering packages with their blue or white vans. Every since they started,  I’ve had quite a few issues! I’ve have packages that never showed and had to end up getting my money back or have them resend it. Claiming that my house was not accessible! I’ve been staying here for over a year and NEVER have I had an issue until they started using the random people in these vans! I checked videos from the cameras around my house and it showed where these people are throwing my packages!! I wish I could post the videos!!! Come on amazon you have to do better!",1
"I have spent lots of money with Amazon and have always loved the thing I get. Also love how fast it gets to me,  normally  2 days.",2
I like amazon but when I wanted to voice my opinion about a seller they would not post my review,1
"I have placed an abundance of orders with Amazon during the last couple of years, none of which gave me any trouble. I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* ""Supersaver"" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shops I hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon. All in all though, one of the best shops online.",2
"I order a lot on amazon. They usually ask for comments on items. I did a lot of comments on the items that I purchsed. I suddenly realised that I canot add comments on the quality os some that I recived and had to return them. I recall 3 times that I left comments amd truly said but Amazon send me a espouse that it canot be published. I wondered at the time of Amazon was trying to protect customers or the businesses that are selling on Amazon. Customers are allowed to leave comments that are honest and true, but Amazon filtering stops negative ones and this is not protecting the customers rights but businesses. If we the customers stop buying from Amazon, where would Amazon be.",1
I found  price %60 off for Adidas shoes ordered and after 3 days it was with me so I'm happy thanks !,2
Sometime the delivery can take longer than expected from retailers through Amazon and occasionally an item will run out of stock. However most of the time you receive a fast and efficient service. Recommended!,2
"Although I have been happy with Amazon's assistance and prompt order I noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes, as most fur is imported from China and former Soviet States with animals skinned alive, electrocuted and very much abused I do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site, please consider an ethical overhaul of some item lines",1
if your looking for something the first place to look is amazon if the don't have it you'll struggle to find it and they're service and delivery is superb is excelant. ,2
"Since 2006, we have placed almost a hundred orders with Amazon.com.  To the best of my memory, we have never had to contact customer service, and we have never had any bad experiences with Amazon or with anyone who was selling on Amazon.  They seem to be a very well run company.  I realize that not everyone will have such good luck, but their overall record is probably very good.      For $90 a year we get amazon prime, which means we get free two day shipping on most items that are ordered directly from Amazon.  Since we get the free shipping, it is very difficult for other websites (where we usually have to pay shipping) to compete with Amazon.  That is why we end up placing most of our orders with Amazon.  Amazon prime was a smart idea.      What makes shopping on Amazon such a great experience is that alot of people write reveiws of the products on Amazon.  That helps us alot when we make our buying decisions.      I do not recall any bad experiences with the vendors who sell on the Amazon marketplace.   However, some vendors are slower than others.  If you order from an unfamiliar vendor, be prepared to wait.      So far, we have been very satisfied.   Hope they keep up the good work!",2
Some of the best customer service of any company I’ve ever purchased from.,2
"3 years ago someone who spoke English would have solved my issue within 5 minutes. It took 30 minutes, 2 phone calls and 7 customer service agents to tell me that they could not help me, nor truly understand my issue. This was an utter waste of time. Amazon has really gone down hill.",0
"I order a lot of books for my business. I love to shop on Amazon because I can find the books I need and search by price, so that I can find the book at rock bottom prices. I also find it extremely helpful that Amazon includes pretty extensive details about the book, such as the number of pages, a description, all of the sellers that offer the book (new and used), and even supplies reviews from users like me, all on one page.",2
"I ordered an item on November 15. I received the item November 17. Unfortunately the order person did not put the item in my mailbox but put it sticking out under the doormat, It would have fit in the mailbox but the lid on the box would not be able to close. that is not a problem. The post office routinely puts letters and packages in the box even though the box lid does not close. I would have preferred the item be put in the box and not partially under the mat. I did see the package but had i not been paying attention I would have stepped on it. Please put my packages in the mailbox. Thank you.",1
"Had a very bad experience, bought a camera from Amazon and the flash was not compatible, I was asked to return it which i did but i lost more than 300usd, they took 100usd for restocking and i spent over 300 usd for shipping expenses.  I regretted it.",0

Beware Canadian I’ve been customer for almost 10 years now. Had an incident where I ordered 3 same items I received 2 the right item the third had the label on one side of the item I ordered but the upper had different item which contains something that I didn’t even ordered. Called customer service explained the issue and they told me I need to return the item request a refund and ordered again which I did. Now I received an email from Amazon that I haven’t returned the correct item and they will charge me for it. Really this is becoming theft by corporation on consumers. Ontario issued consumer beware list on Amazon.caIt’s time to drop Amazon and go back to our old habits of shopping. on my end I cancelled Prime membership and requested a delete of my account. The trust went from 100 to zero.I also will be placing a complaint to Quebec consumer protection bureau as this is unacceptable for any business.,0

"items stolen AGAIN!! This is not the first time .. have installed a delivery box and still the items are left by the door , so even put written instructions on the delivery box and the door nope still the same ... so delivery drivers cant read??? Do they not have to pass a crime check??Have been told latest scam is delivery driver takes a picture then tells his mates where to go .. BUT legally you can claim a refund or replacement as LAW state this is not been delivered if left on door step , that's why the drivers say handed to resident which again is not proof of delivery ... im cancelling anything to do with amazon prime , alexas are going in the bin the company has got so corrupt with its ""AI"" bull crap all that is, is a way to watch and listen more to you, AMAZON your a disgrace with incompetence drivers who steal and con us and you ... BUT hey you need a heart to care !!!!!!!",0
Thank you for,1
Revolutionary.  Thank you for changing the world in favor of consumers.,2
"Overall I do not have a problem with Amazon. Admittedly, the shipment assistance has been slow since COVID 19,but I can accept that.  I can not accept that there have been two occurrences when I place an order and then the item simply disappears. The item is still for sale but for triple the price or more. Of course when you contact customer assistance they claim the item is no longer available which is dishonest and untrue. I do not believe this is a way to run a company but perhaps customers matter less when the owner is a billionaire.",1
"I have been a customer of amazon.com for a long time. I am overall satisfied with its assistances. However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer assistance to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service has had a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.",1
"I have a love hate relationship with Amazon. Most of the items are decent. Prime shipping is most of the time decent, but more times than not, my items are dropped at the wrong address, wrong size, broken or damaged, and the order drivers are something else. The customer support is pretty great. Amazon is fine for cheap, fast ordering. But don’t expect the best or it to be on time.",1
I bought a piece of equipment about four years ago that was junk from Amazon and the company that I had to send it back to you charge me $17 to have it shipped back to them I called Amazon and they assured me that they were going to give me a $17 credit which they say is on my account but every time I try to use it I cannot find it and when they help me they tell me I cannot use it this has been going on for three years and every time I chat with them all I do is get jerked around they should be ashamed of their customer service department,0
I’ve always had excellent buying experiences with Amazon. I’ve made countless purchases over the years. The website has everything. The clear filtering format makes the process quicker to find what you want vs wasting time. My deliveries usually come on time but on occasion deliveries have been left outside behind bins etc.,2
"I mean it's really not that average. Although I usually just get a free trial, and order something once a year. But when I do the goods is decent. ",1
Its very best company because it provides all things which are used in our life from online its a e.commerce app,0

Called two days later to ask about a refund...after being out thru to several employees who obviously don't know there job , others informed me I would have my refund of 53$ and change by today..needless to say it hasn't been. I got on chat again and now they say they won't refund but 6$ out of the whole order....they've lost a customer..hey but what do ya expect out of demonrats?! Wouldn't even give them one star..terrible customer service.try hiring english speaking people to assist",0
Amazon in se è top ma la sua assistente clienti fa pena è davvero una vergogna,1
"I've written a review for one of the products I've purchased through Amazon. Amazon reviewed my message and didn't post my message, because I was not recommending that seller based on my experience. I was trying to share my genuine experience with what I've faced and didn't use any bad words in my message. Similarly Amazon might have NOT posted messages which gives negative feedback about their customers. Since then I don't trust amazon customer reviews because they hide lot of truth reviews and buyers like me get trapped to one of their seller customer products. And all the products from amazon are China products these days and also expensive with less quality. so I'm trying to share my review in another portal like here so that my message wil get to some people and not get trapped in amazon's bad online marketing strategy.",0

no problems here,1
"The most appalling customer service.  A gift voucher I bought had been redeemed by the time Amazon had sent me the email to say it was ready to be accessed on my account.  15 calls and 9 emails and still not resolved.  Each time I have had to explain, put on hold and then after 10 minutes the call is then disconnected.  I then email and they say to call....I then call and told to email.  Even ring backs put you through an IVR and are treated as fresh calls.  Ultimately the gift card was redeemed before Amazon sent me claim details and therefore is their risk.  Worst ever customer experience.",0
"Amazon is not what is use to be. Sad when their returns team says you returned a wrong item. I ordered a beige out door umbrella, they sent me a green one so I returned it. Now they want me to send them a beige one back when I never received that color. They won't help you, then have supervisors hang up on you because they say they can not help you and to email returns.  I have ordered thousands of dollars in items from Amazon over the years. I will never use Amazon again.  Based on reading others reviews, lost of Amazon is losing lots of customers Great job Amazon.",0
"Amazon is so awful, half the stuff in my packages are always missing, items delivered to the wrong houses, entire packages not showing up. Then they try and tell me I’ve had too many refunds on my account… due to them messing up every order I place. Doing my head in",0

So I blame FedEx for not doing their job properly, not Amazon who hired them to do a job. When it's been Amazon delivering directly, or UPS, or the Post Office, then it's been excellent.",2
"I have a love hate relationship with Amazon. Most of the items are decent. Prime shipping is most of the time decent, but more times than not, my items are dropped at the wrong address, wrong size, broken or damaged, and the order drivers are something else. The customer support is pretty great. Amazon is acceptable for cheap, fast ordering. But don’t expect the best or it to be on time.",1
Thanks  for getting my order delivered succesfully,2

My son got a kindle fire kids tablet for Christmas from his aunt. I didnt have an amazon account before he got his tablet I had to set one up. His tablet broke after only 3 weeks and I figured with the 2 year warranty that came with the pad I could replace it. Well I contact amazon and they supposedly need a debit or credit card before they can process the warranty I dont have a debit or credit card and so they told me they couldn't replace the tablet. I will never order from Amazon this is a joke I cant get my kids Christmas present replaced just because I do t have a credit or debit card.,0
"I love being able to order just about anything from cleaning products, food, furniture, clothing and have it delivered within 1-2 days. It is so frustrating to go to a local store and they are out of things you need. I don’t even waste my time anymore just order it on amazon always in stock, no lines and no more dealing with poor customer service in stores.",2
Always on time! great customer service and great products. No complaints here!,2
"do not expect much from support, if your package doesn't get delivered you are pretty much just going to loose all the money you paid for it. Finding contacts for chat or telephone number for amazon is nearly impossible, you need to go through at least 20 different webpages before you can get an option to chat with them. this experience is a nightmare, one I wish I never was in.",0
"Due to laziness, the Amazon delivery guy went to the back yard, to the back door, and left a ton of refrigerated food there w/ fresh flowers in the 98% weather. My car was parked in front of the house & there was zero indication that the back door is used.  Who does that?  Amazon has also stolen from me.They were charging me monthly fees for what they repeatedly PROMISED was their “FREE” book selling offer. Not only are prices often the highest in town, but unethical sellers send out broken junk, like the Black and Decker air compressor I bought. I refuse to do business with Amazon, after their lying & stealing from me, i feel they’re a typical greed driven corrupt entity.I didn’t purchase the food that was left at the back door, It was a gift. To me, Amazon sucks.",0
Amazon has started a new business they gonna show you a product on a discounted price in which the deliver will be between 10-15 days. After 15 days nobody from Amazon will contact you and on the application the status will be delivery rescheduled as per customer request. If you will call customer service they will say it will take 4-5 Days more now again the same thing will happen and after holding the money for more then 1 month they will say we are unable to deliver the product we are refunding the amount.Now the point is if they are holding the money for a month for hundreds of people they do not have to do any business because they will get the interest from the bank and from customer support you will just hear apologies,0
"As if Amazon couldn't get any worse. Here's the email I just sent them for removing all my always truthful reviews. All I can think is they are part of this scam the specific vendor is runningYou removed all my reviews because I warned people about a vendor and I have a letter from postmaster general and the fraudulent label to prove they committed mail fraud and also to get vengeance for leaving a truthful review about a shoddy product charged me and sent me the same product a week after I returned it. I've never given anything but accurate honest reviews and if you're going to start silencing customers I'm filing a complaint with BBB and letting everyone on social media know. Postmaster showed me the labels they use are created on Photoshop and then customer has to pay $12.43 for shipping cause the seller didn't pay the postage. The postmaster contacted the authorities because what the vendor is doing is a FEDERAL OFFENSE. NOT TO MENTION, I never ordered a 2nd pair and they not only charged me for them but then I had to pay postage. Same thing happened with 1st order. I returned those and only. Got back something like $12 which didn't even cover the postage. You need to stop silencing customers who have valid warnings and only. Post truthful reviews. I will not take the horrible way you've been treating me, freezing my account and now removed every review i ever posted plus I'll never be allowed to post a review again. I'm filing a complaint with BBB because your reasoning is unfounded and If I need to I will file a lawsuit for discrimination. You have a vendor scamming customers and rather than protect them you elect to allow it continue. Another way Amazon is proving they hold all the power and Americans are at the conglomerates mercy Will post a picture of the label when I get it from my mother's car tomorrow which proves this vendor is running a scam and Amazon is allowing it",0

"Going, going gone. Customer service and their loyalty to the customer are a thing of the past.  Their people are spoiled little know-it-alls who are arrogant and actually know very little. Many Amazon representatives have very heavy accents, are difficult to understand, in many cases speaking broken English, lacking basic writing skills. This translates into people who cannot understand what you are calling about or how to help you. Amazon yet again ticked me off with more aggravating issues.  First was a problem with my Amazon 55"" Omni TV which recently started having additional software issues, this time with the picture setting Vivid. I called Amazon and explained the TV would not stay on the Vivid setting and kept going to Natural instead. This was never an issue in the past. Per their request I rebooted the TV, after, I unplugged the TV which still did not work. They then wanted me to reset the TV back to factory settings which I said I would not do as it would not fix the issue, the problem was on their end and that they needed to submit a ticket. The Amazon support person said they cannot until I reset the TV as requested. After over an hour, I advised I would just wait until someone else calls, then takes the hours to reset the TV for them to find out I was right. It only took two days for me to be proven right and the issue to be fixed. Next I wrote a product review for a shampoo and conditioner as follows, which was rejected by morons several times.Review: Title: Excellent product - highly recommend.Text: I developed a very itchy scalp from environmental allergies which was greatly exacerbated by another high end conditioner. Even when I stopped using it, the itch would not go away, even after several months. I read many reviews, found this conditioner along with the shampoo which was in a two pack. Love it. Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control. Both the Shampoo and Conditioner smell great. I did receive a card in the mail from the manufacturer stating I would receive a small gift for leaving a honest review which I would have done without it, so it was just an additional benefit. Tip: In my opinion the conditioner goes faster, so we buy at least a couple of the combination pack, and then an extra one or two of the conditioner.Amazons reply: Hello, Specifically, I would like to draw your attention to the following guideline: -We don't allow content that advocates or threatens physical or financial harm to yourself or others. ------ review you posted (as listed above) the line we rejected for is ""Stopped the itch completely, and it keeps it under control."" Why we rejected ---1. Product work differently for every individual not same working for everyone.2. If you said it worked perfectly and we approved and if some another customer uses it and have harsh reactions , then that person will be in serious trouble.Note, my review is like millions of others giving their opinion. Amazon has dug in their heels. Their CEO and Executives are cowards who cannot and will not take the time to respond to the little people, instead their underpaid, low intelligence employees handle it. From this point on, purchasing from Amazon is only, and I mean only in on an emergency basis, such as for health issues where I cannot get the product anywhere else. From what I read I believe they already laid off around 10,000 employees, and I look forward to many more to come.  Amazon is very slowly becoming a thing of the past. A relative has Walmart+ and they are making inroads, getting better and better by the day. I will make sure to post my opinion on every website possible along with sending copies of the Amazon email to family and friends for a good laugh!",0
so much stuff to choose from u can always find what you want and usually for cheaper than everywhere else,2
"Prices are fine, and I've had fine interaction with customer assistance. Whenever I had an issue, they just refunded, no questions asked. Overall I'm happy with them.The problem is the purchasing interaction and scammers. The web UI can get very confusing, mixing new and used in the same page, sometimes a single listing is from a certain buyer, sometimes there are several, and so on. Can get lost easily.A big issue is with scams/fake reviews. Lots of listing are full of reviews for a completely different item. Sometimes the same listing includes different items, and others the seller switched items and kept all reviews. Very hard to tell which items are fine or average based on that.",1
"I'm shocked at the poor reviews Amazon has on this site. I guess the only ones leaving reviews here are those looking to vent. Been shopping from them since they only sold books. Best customer service in the world, bar none. You can always trust them to fix any problem you have with your orders.",2
"Had some problems with the shipment and the customer support didnt really listened to me or tried to help me out, but i figure they don't make the whole company so its not the end of the world",1
What an insanely great website!!,2
I'm very disappointed because you do not have the same goodss on all your websited. Why do you have a goods on .com website and not on .be website? ,1
"Constant bait and switch on Amazon fresh. They figure out what items you actually want, refuse to let you actually buy them, and then Jack the price by 50% to 100% when you add them back to your cart again.",0
"Absolutely lazy, rude and not caring customer support. They'll block your account even you're the rightful owner of the account, if they feel like it.",0
Amazon is a staple for my Xmas shopping. They make any gift giving an easy task even for the pickiest people. I go to Amazon for everyone & their variety of products make shopping so easy.,2
This is a great site.  I have bought and sold on this site and am absolutely delighted with it.  I can order things one day and receive the next day and am also making money selling things I no longer want or need.  You can also trade in.  Brilliant,2
"This is specific to Amazon business, which is one of the worst experiences in retail out of any modern company. Absolutely horrendous service. After spending over 45mins dealing with them, nothing gets resolved.Update:After 3 weeks of chasing the issues eventually got resolved. Don't expect the level of service that you are used to with normal Amazon, the business team needs to step up their game.",0
"Amazon has really dropped the ball this holiday season. The app sent an alert about a package being delayed with no expected order date. Upon contacting customer assistance, I was told it would be delivered on time. When it wasn't delivered, I aain contacted customer assistance to be told it would not be delivered until 4 days after Christmas.  I requested a refund at this time and was offered a promotional credit for the inconvenience.  I then contacted customer assistance because the promotional credit was not showing on the account only to find out the credit is only usable if I find and purchase a goods sold by Amazon specifically (not a vendor of Amazon). So purchase something I may not want just to use a ""credit"" applied? In other words, give Amazon my money. Getting pretty tired of the average business with Amazon.",1
"My item was delivered to another house and  still don't know where it went, i spent half an hour in the cold trying to find the item in the garden. They often don't deliver right, leave it outside in a paper or cardboard envelope where it gets wet. On the times where u are in and they do knock, they run off leaving it outside, before you can receive the parcel and whether you are in or out it's just left, when u are out they send you an email to say it was handed to resident when it wasn't. The customer service is abysmal! It's impossible to get anyone on the phone and it took me over an hour and a half to get anyone one on the chat bots. Eventually a human in the internet chat offered me a voucher for my terrible experience to which a manager took over and reversed it and said it was tough but they couldn't give me anything. I made a complaint about their customer service and the reply to which I copy below. I since haven't received any refund for the item that wasn't delivered despite as advised requesting. Use this company at your peril. Yes it's slightly cheaper when you don't have any problems but once you take into the delivery costs there's not that much in it. Instead of a corporate entity that doesn't care about its customers Im now going to use independent reliable companies with a good reputation and I  don't mind paying a tiny bit more for.  U can get similar prices for books with forbidden planet where you can get someone on the phone if any problems and you can also shop around with Blackwell's, bookshop org, foyles, hive, Waterstones, wordery, whsmiths and world of books to name a few to try instead....Here's the reply to my complaint quoted from Amazon....HelloI'm Greeshma from Management team.I'm sorry to hear that you had an unsatisfactory experience when you contacted us previously and for any misunderstanding that may have occurred. We appreciate that you took the time to share your concerns about our customer service. I have passed your feedback along to the appropriate people in our company.I'm sorry to hear that you still haven't received your order #202-4980457-7937901, even though the tracking says it's been delivered.I can see that my colleague has issued a replacement for the item to the same address but it has been cancelled.If you'd like to receive a refund instead, please feel free to write us back.After reviewing our previous correspondence with you, please accept my apologies for any misunderstanding caused due to incorrect promise on goodwill gesture.This situation was the result of a human error, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused.We hope you'll understand that we can't offer you any concession in relation to this matter.Rest assured that we're striving to correct any inconsistencies in our processes and those of our carriers, and that your feedback is invaluable to us.I hope that you will allow us another opportunity to prove the quality of our service to you in the future.Warmest regards,Greeshma",0

On top of terrible automated service you treat your employees terribly. You are abelist and cancel insurance for your disabled employees while refusing employees the ability to be on LTD. You have an employee dying of cancer because you won't approve her LTD despite her recent cancer diagnosis. You are disgusting and benefit off of slavery. Your operation should be shut down. ,0
Goodbye Amazon. You have also sent your customer service overseas and as usual it sucks. Our family is done with you. ,0
LOVE amazon... has everything with great shipping and super easy returns (though that’s rarely necessary!),2
Amazon's Customer Service efforts have really deteriorated the past few months. They can no longer process simple returns. I have received inaccurate information on numerous occasions. They can't provide information regarding whether returned items were received or are if refunds are in process.,0

"Bought some stuff as gift for my friends in the US. I used my Ireland credit card and the gifts were delivered on time and in perfect condition! The fx rates aren't the best in the market (actually, they are a bit bad). So thats something you might want to look out for! Sometimes, it might be worth paying in your own the specific currency than in your own currency, as yopu bank might offer you a better rate. But I would definitelky deal with them again",2
"Amazon has great prices, and there is no end to what you will find to fit your needs, however, I cannot always trust the sellers. Amazon leaves it up to the customer to research their sellers to find out if they are legitimate and follow acceptable business practices. They also do a terrible job with packaging their orders. I received an order of 3 reams of copy paper that was put in this giant box that would be suited for a huge picture frame. The reams of paper slid all around inside and the item packing was all tore up. The paper was a mess! Amazon packaging is also very wasteful. I once received 3 little packs of Name averagege stickers in a box a little bigger than a shoebox! For a company that makes the billions it does, you think they could afford to research, review, and oversee the quality and legitimacy of their sellers in real time.",1
"Ordered 3 items from Amazon and none of them was delivered , said online that items was received by resident, which obviously never happened. They told me I need to get a police report for them , police told me that Amazon need to contact them as it’s there issue as there drivers didn’t deliver , I’ve asked Amazon repeatedly to send me proof ( photo, signature) that item was delivered, they  said they have none. Now because it’s more than sixty days Amazon are saying case closed and I’m not allowed a refund for items I’ve paid for and didn’t receive. Isn’t that theft ??? They drag the process out and don’t get back to you when they say they will do so the case goes over 60 days . Will never in my lifetime purchase anything of them again.",0

"Prime is not worth the money.Items are now constantly late, if u contact customer services they don't do anything about it even though u are paying subscription for quick delivery",0
Don't know what all the bad reviews are about. It seems like mainly angry people venting. Amazon has the same products as supermarkets for much cheaper prices. And unlike royal mail or hermes in the uk their delivery is 95% of the time on or before the delivery date. Packages are very rarely lost and customer service are always very helpful and will give you coupons if they can't fix your issue. They're the only online business that are actually trustworthy and won't try to screw you. Only very minor issue i have with them is when a delivery date changes and they don't notify you or ask if you'd like to cancel/ refund. They don't even tell you it changed if you check which can make you doubt yourself. Again this is very rare to happen and they are generally excellent.,2
"I have 2 issues with Amazon. I have an issue with having to send things back via UPS, we don't have a UPS store here. You can, however, print out a label they will send you, and you can put it in the UPS Dropbox, however we don't have those and I don't have a printer! So if I get things that don't fit or I just don't like them I cannot send them back and I'm stuck with them. It gets old. The second issue I have is their packaging. Most of the time you get 1 or 2 small items in a large box, what a waste. sometimes they come in plastic envelopes and are smashed because there's no protection.I'd rather have small boxes because then they fit in the parcel lockers at the Post Office and I don't have to take off of work early to go pick up my packages because they don't fit. I can recycle the cardboard, I just think it's stupid to put a calendar in a box that you could fit 10 pairs of shoes in it. I've contacted them several times about these issues and have yet to see a response. And I use amazon ALOT!",1
I've never been disappointed when using Amazon.com.  They stand behind their products and products of outside sellers thru them.  You can't go wrong using ,2

"Today was a prime deal day!!! Been looking for videos about a CosmoGrill Outdoor XL Smoker Barbecue Charcoal Portable BBQ Grill Garden... was reduced to £139.99... I'm very upset, that at 22:50pm, UK time, which still part of the same day ( 11/07/2023), the promotion was already gone, and the price went up £30 to £169.99.....Forty minutes later, price went back to £139.99, but only give me option of adding to the basket, no way we can buy this item, unless we buy at normal price of £169.99. This morning Was trying to buy purina cat dry food, the same issue, unable to buy, but is showing on my basket... This is fake advertising... Promoting prime day, but some items are not available to buy. Wasting me at least 60 minutes of my time!!! time wasters and fake adverts.

"I'm buying on Amazon from time to time. Once I bought birthday balloons. They were not cheap. However, one of the balls turned out to be a hole. The only way to get the refund was to send the balloons back, but the envelope was in the bin, so I did not have an address where to send it. And I also assume that sending them back will cost me more than balloons. I had to buy new balloons again, but in the store. Thus, I paid twice, and I felt that I was not protected in this case.",1
Best app for shopping,1
Service is excellent and all merchandise lives up to its description.,2
"I have placed an abundance of orders with Amazon during the last couple of years, none of which gave me any trouble. I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* ""Supersaver"" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shops I hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon. All in all though, one of the best shops online.",2

"Well in June 14 2024 at 10:04pm an Ebike and lock for it where purchased on a fraudulent Amazon account WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Now unfortunately the account was made by a family member and they used my address for the order. When the items where delivered I returned it ASAP. NOW AMAZON DID send the refund for $418.74 back to my card however do to all the fraudulent activities going on in the world today I keep my card locked.  So I Did Not get my refund. Now I call Amazon and let them know what happened they are holding on to my refund now. All because the fraudulent account have more rights then using my card. I Gave Amazon ALL of the INFORMATION they asked for about the fraudulent account. Amazon keep emailing the fraudulent account like I have access to it. I don't I need that $418.74 more Jeff Bezos does. We live in a sick sick world. Amazon should verify with person that's name on the card is making the order before the order goes through. There should be a way to do that. I have had Amazon for years before this. I should have been asked by Amazon am I creating an new account and verify with me. All of that money they could make it safer if they cared to. Also, FIY the person who made the fraudulent account does not want me to get my $ 418.74 back. Is making codes for ordering on Amazon accounts and cards that hard to do? I would give 0 star if I could. ",0
"I joined Amazon Prime 3 months ago ,all was good until i noticed they were not only taking one subscription but two,one from the uk and one from the USA apparently this is a common problem.Trying to sort it out isa a nightmare, can,t find who i have to contact ,UK says it,s the USA,the USA says it,s UK,when i did manage to speak to a human she was in INDIA and i could not understand what she was saying.I will never deal with Amazon again,",0
Customer support was unable to make a trade in for the newest Kendal fire. I bought in July of 2018.  They offered me 20.00 dollars for a just out of warranty goods. Because their was no option listed to trade it in on their website. This is horrible. Be aware of their policies before ever buying any electronics of any kind,1
I had a parcel delivered recently and the delivery driver stood in the middle of the street and launched my parcel into the doorway. Its on a doorbell camera so it was very clearly seen. I now no longer use Amazon. Luckily for me the item I had ordered did not get damaged just the box. ,0

"I place orders all the time on Amazon for work and for personal use.  The orders ship quickly, arrive in good condition, in a timely fashion and are exactly what I ordered/ expected.  Their website is one of the most user friendly ones I use daily, so I order from Amazon as often as I can.",2
Sometimes not the cheapest but Amazon never fails to have excellent products at excellent prices.  I love the fact that when you buy directly from them and the product is not to your satisfaction you can send it back for free.  I made the mistake of buying Dr. Marten boots from ebay instead of Amazon and because they were too big had to pay a whopping £7.50 to return them.  I was gutted and vowed never to buy shoes from ebay again!  Amazon all the way!,2
Amazon has the WORST customer service. These people truly make it known they don’t give a *%#^ about you or the issue that you are experiencing. Also many of these people are so incompetent that I would rather be dealing with a primate.,0

I find amazon is no longer as great when it first started blooming. Packages don't arrive at all or don't arrive withing the prime time. Just no longer a big fan.,1
"I thought I should put an opinion on here to balance all the angry ones. I've been a customer since 2005 so I have plenty of experience of dealing with them. Before this year, I never had any particular issue - of course, occasionally things were delayed, but the tracking on their website or external couriers tells you  the expected due date, so there are no surprises. The goods have been as described, with rarely the odd error which was corrected when they were notified.The reason I'm posting now is because this Christmas (2021) several things went wrong; two packages weren't delivered - they got stuck at customs and never reappeared - and three things I bought all broke (a phone, a smartwatch and a belt for bad backs). All were ordered from abroad, so returning the items was a little more complicated than usual and involved arguing in the local village post office, who had no idea what to do with the labels and forms. However, Amazon themselves couldn't have been more helpful. In one case they changed the return label for a different courier because DHL wouldn't collect the package (that's another story, 'computer says no'). I had to phone Amazon three times to sort things out, and they did everything to make it as painless as possible.Whether a large corporation should survive by gobbling up the opposition is another question...but Amazon are, in my experience, reliable and generally cheaper. That's why I'm still using them after all this time.",2

"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",0

"I've written a review for one of the products I've purchased through Amazon. Amazon reviewed my message and didn't post my message, because I was not recommending that seller based on my experience. I was trying to share my genuine experience with what I've faced and didn't use any bad words in my message. Similarly Amazon might have NOT posted messages which gives negative feedback about their customers. Since then I don't trust amazon customer reviews because they hide lot of truth reviews and buyers like me get trapped to one of their seller customer products. And all the products from amazon are China products these days and also expensive with less quality. so I'm trying to share my review in another portal like here so that my message wil get to some people and not get trapped in amazon's bad online marketing strategy.",0
"Amazon fraudulent Don't buy any amazon gift card and redeem to your amazon account, amazon will close your account anytime they want and they give you no reason why they closed your account.  Whatever amount you have in your amazon account they will keep all.  NEVER NEVER AND NEVER redeem any gift card into your amazon account.   I have around $8,000 in my amazon account, amazon locked and closed my account.",0
"I ordered an electric rototiller on a Sunday, it shipped and said I would receive it Friday, (so I could use it for the weekend)  Amazon said it shipped out, then the next day I got an email from Amazon saying the package is being returned because it's undeliverable.  What the heck?  Then I went to check the item and the price doubled.  I've been a customer for a long time, never an issue until this, what are they trying to pull here?  Now on top of the ordered being canceled I have to wait for a refund, and I won't be able to get a tiller befor the weekend, thanks a lot Amazon!!!!",0
Amazon always has my back. I’ve never had a bad experience with them and I order thousands of times with them. Always fast and accurate shipping and will correct any problems with a generous return policy.,2
"Amazon is my favorite place to order almost everything.  I am a Prime Member...worth the money.  I am careful about ordering from independent merchants.  However, when I had an issue with a merchant, Amazon helped to resolve the issue, and I got my refund (for an item that I never received).",2
Very good and useful site,2
I bought cell phone excellent service timely received,2
"Not sure what has happened to Amazon, but I feel like they just don't care when they mess up anymore.  It actually seems like they mess up more often than they get it right. Deliveries don't come when they say, they drop my packages at neighbor's places and their customer service is an absolute joke.  I will say I dealt with a very kind customer service rep last night after having one leave me on hold for about 30 mins then hung up without ever coming back.  When I called back, I dealt with a rep called Parag who actually helped me and was not rude in any way, like usual.  This got me to thinking about every other time I have called Amazon and been treated like I did something wrong.  Hello Amazon, people don't just complain to complain!!  If someone has the patience to deal with your automated system interrogation in order to speak with someone, they must really have had a bad experience.  How I know they don't care, when my delivery got postponed to the next day, they sent me a message that they were sorry my order was delayed and that I can cancel the order and get a full refund.  NO!! Just bring me what I paid for!! Do better Amazon!!  It's just getting worse and your prices aren't like they used to be!!",0
"Amazon is everything a site should be.  It is super easy to find what I want, and shipping is generally pretty fast.  I invested in a Kindle Fire this year, it is so easy to use -- absolutely seamless with Amazon.com.",2

"I returned items worth £600 with tracking number confirming delivery to amazon return facility. Amazon kept saying to wait another week, end of the month, end of this or that, until it was months and the courier archived the tracking number and then amazon said that they couldn't refund my £600 worth of items as the tracking number was not active. It is a shame what a fraudulent company they have become.On the fraudulent note, their drivers steal my packages, never deliver them, I then alert amazon and they tell me 'our system says it was delivered, call the police and ask them to investigate'. It is appalling what amazon has become. Its worse than the Evri delivery service, funny enough, amazon is one of the only companies still using evri as courier delivery service, it speaks volumes, the company with such low standards uses the delivery service that everyone knows is the worst in the world. Amazon used to be a good quality service, it is now appalling, you need to hope your item arrives, as you pay for it regardless of it arriving or if the delivery driver steals it.",0
"Overall, my usage with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same item, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer assistance...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their items better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.",1
"Lack of customer service or care, delays in receiving orders, and complete lack of accountability.",0
"TLDR - Do not consolidate the delivery date, unless you want it to be late. One part of my order would have been delivered Wed, and the other part on Thur, but I picked the fewer deliveries option which showed everything would be delivered on Fri.  Tracking still shows as delivering by 8 pm, but UPS doesn't even have the tracking number in the system.  Will not be making that mistake again!  From now on everything can be delivered individually!!",0
"Amazon has gotten to be one of the worst companies ever. They very Notorious liars. There delivery team constantly say they have delivered something and have not only for it to be delivered next day. Prime is not worth it no more. You pay for the service and it says your items will be delivered the next day only to be delayed a week and this is not a one time thing. It has happened to every delivery I have had in the last couple of months. Cancel your prime or stop shopping from Amazon. There prices are not much different no a days than any other competitor. I loved Amazon once upon a time and now I’m very disappointed at them. Like now, I was told my delivery was 3 stops away. Got off early to be here not 2 hours later no delivery be cause now the driver have to go make several more stops before coming to me. My order got pushed back while he was shopping at the mall literally 2 mins from my house. I could see him on the map for 2 hours at the mall. Go figure! Screw Amazon. Trump should shut you down. I’m not even a fan of him but I agree with this.",0
"Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on items (like baby items) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.  So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of items, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not. I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt acceptable for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon. The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.",1
But I don't use it,1
"I ordered an IPad Air from Amazon (the company itself rather than a Marketplace seller) on 24th November. It was meant to be my daughter’s Christmas present and it cost several hundred pounds. It should have been delivered to me on 26th November, though instead I was delivered a box of opened dry cat food. I presume that an Amazon employee somewhere along the chain took the IPad and replaced it with the cat food that they emptied to an equivalent weight.I phoned Amazon Customer Services on 26th November and explained what had happened. I asked I be sent an actual IPad Air, though was told I could only be refunded the money, and only once Amazon had “received my return” (the cat food). UPS collected the cat food from me on 27th and delivered it to Amazon on 28th November.Two and a half weeks and several phone calls to Amazon down the line I was told today that “hopefully” I should be refunded my money on 3rd January 2024 (38 days after I’d initially explained to Amazon what had happened and “returned” the item).Each Amazon Customer Services person over the past couple of weeks has treated me indifferently, as if I’m a customer who has returned an unwanted book rather than someone who has essentially been defrauded by an Amazon employee. In actual fact I’ve been treated worse than someone returning an unwanted book, as if it had been a low cost item that was being refunded I would have been reimbursed within 14 days, rather than it taking more than a month because of the financial cost involved. I have kept on being told to “be patient” and that I’ll be refunded in 5 to 10 days, though the date keeps being put back for no reason that anyone has explained, and now for some reason I won’t be refunded until 2024. It means my daughter will be without a Christmas present this year. No one at Amazon seems particularly bothered or sympathetic.I might continue to buy inexpensive items from Amazon that I can’t easily get elsewhere, though I certainly won’t be buying anything expensive from them again. Though buying from Amazon is often convenient, it is much safer to shop with a retailer with decent, accessible and relatively transparent Customer Services.",0

"Have been a prime member for years. Recently - the massive company that is Amazon, not only is charging me for membership (which is so I can enjoy free deliveries), but have now started charging for next day delivery and you now have to spend over £20.00 for same day delivery. Why are we paying for membership? I would like the Managing /Director of Amazon to read this!! Please make sure he gets this message. You had my my loyalty for years. Please do not trample it!I never though Amazon would have become so underhanded to try these tactics.I also spoke with an agent today who was the most rude, obnoxious, customer service agent I have ever come across. She was not listening to me, she was over talking me, she was condescending, she did not try to help, she tried to frighten me by saying that my account had been compromised as I had 42 different accounts? If this is the case then Amazon has let fraudulent activity take place without my knowledge.Call was made today on 14/10/2023 from the UK - the agent I spoke with was named Samantha.Disgusting behaviors from Amazon and it's associates!!!!!Please let me know what you intend to do about the above two issues!!!!",0

"I have been with amazon since 2009 and have been buying a whole lot stuffs from it and mostly satisfied with. It is not anymore. I recently ordered a lot of things from this platform too. However, many of my ordered have been canceled with the same reason which says “cannot delivered/have problem with shipment”. All the canceled orders sold by amazon and a US based company. Not any orders sold by China based has been canceled. What happened to Amazon? Is it a China Company now? I am so disappointed and frustrated.",1

I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day shipment and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1

After several calls come  to fi d find out they never had it in stock.never any feed ba k fro. Amozon.  She orderd shoes around the same time got a notification  they were running  late and was eligible for a  refund.

There was no my package or any signs of delivery service, but at 15:58 status was changed to ""delivered"". I ask custom service about investigation and was very surptized: they ask me to go to local police and report of stilling. This is how amazon trying not only to shift it's responcibility to me, but also because of very unprofessional service make big troubles to it's customers: if I was sitting all time at door, and see that package was not delivered and noone still it, it mean that I will make false statement and will have big troubles.

But they have a big problem with their search app.I searched on 10 foot soaker hose and I pressed the Prime button so I wouldn't see non prime stuff.

And there were non-prime items in the list and the same item is listed several times. This is normal now with all my searches. And unless I am very focused, I might buy the wrong item.

"Most items I’ve gotten with no hiccups, but there are a few ordinary sellers.  I ordered crossbars for my 2019 Honda passport and received totally the wrong bars from what I purchased on Amazon.

They said that what they sent me wasn’t even their item. I am appalled that Amazon did not help me whatsoever and would not let me post a review about ASG automotive items out of Michigan.  They tried to tell me that they didn’t even have that item in their building. I returned exactly what I got and they try to steal my money. If you’re going to use Amazon you have a 50-50 shot.

I was looking at reviews for a goods and noticed there are reviews for a completely different goods, which could give the impression that this item has 5 stars but really it’s from ratings from another goods. Don’t know if this is a mistake or scheming but it makes me trust Amazon a lot less..",1
"Everytime i order, always comes on time, always sold at a brilliant price, saves shipping and payment details so it's always spot on with no hassle!",2
"on shipment time. When I order sometime for one day shipment I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
All my products from amazon arrived really quick and ive had no issues.,2
"The company is so big and offers so many different supports in so many locations that it is quite difficult to give it one general grade.The most frequent problem I had was with the couriers, who often are unable to follow the order instructions or do not even attempt to deliver the item.However, the customer support is always helpful. They always throw a few pounds sweetener or a free month of Prime membership. Occasionally I get to keep the wrong item I received - they refund it but ask me to NOT send it back. When their pick up courier was consistently failing to arrive, they offered a full refund for sending the parcel myself via whatever courier I want.",1
They’re always reliable for sure the only times I had any troubles with them was the delivery by Amazon which for whatever reason lost a package of mine. Other than that I’ve never had a problem,2
"+ Good for buying- Main site layout seems a little cluttered at times-  I tried to join amazon handmade as I handmake clothes but they rejected me because they don't believe I make them- and told me to join their normal selling platform. After the rejection email, they wont reply so....",2
"Today contacted with them for a problem with international sales, I am not sure which country their service located but I contacted almost 10 different people, looks like afrikan names. All gave me different information and suddenly disconnected due to their internet connection! After 106 minutes of conversation no solution that was worst experience that i've ever got from Amazon.",0
"Wasn't the greatest support I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
I use Amazon on weekly basis and is a good service except for Prime that is no more as it was in the past. Very often there is no difference between prime and normal delivery time,2

"Changing the game.My personal experience is that Amazon are leading the game in delivery speed, ease and communication. Being able to see the delivery on a map is so easy to do and appreciated, everyone should be doing it. I hope the other delivery companies catch up!",2
excellent service,2
Everything went well. Deliveries take some time tho. But overall pretty well.,1
Amazon has the best customer service ever!!!,2

"Amazon is truly amazing. I am a long time customer and recently I ordered a down alternative comforter and it was delivered, However I made a mistake or someone in the house did and I could not locate the package.  I called Amazon and I told them that I did not receive my package. They issued a refund . I subsequently found my package and I called Amazon back and asked them to cancel the refund . They told me they had no way of canceling the refund, and I did not have to return the item, and I could keep my comforter as a happy holiday gift from Amazon. Now, that's what I call EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! TY AMAZON!",2
"Love amazon. Their shipping for prime speed has gone down but it still is a business I always use for buying stuff.  They also have great rewards from credit card, which always helps .",2
"Pretty decent support so far, but plenty to improve on deliveries and comunication still.Have Kindle unlimited and although is decent you are not able to search only within subscribed books. And the ""unlimited"" label is misleading, most of the best books are excluded.",1
I like to order from amz but their assistance could be better.,1
Fantastic experience - quick delivery & easy to deal with,2
"We ordered an item that had free returns.  All this documented.  When we went to return it it was denied.  We called Amazon and they said they'd take care of it.  We did this at least 6 times and each time Amazon told us we would get our money back.  Then, they denied it.They lied, they falsely advertised.  They used to be good, now they're so big they feel they have control over their customers.  I'm actively looking for a replacement for Amazon.",0
the luggage was not as big as they show in checkout phase. ,1
"I buy 95% of items on Amazon as I don't drive so buy everything online. I always compare Amazon products with other websites and Amazon always I find, is cheaper. Good customer satisfaction and great products",2
"I rarely buy books on amazon these days (my local book store is better value for all but the hardest to find titles), but I love it for odd gifts, executive toys, and even food items that are hard to find where I live.  I just wish the delivery estimates were more accurate.",2
"Absolute poo, poo costumer service, poo products, poo delivery. They lie constantly. When they dont feel like sending you a refund directly in account they tell you they tried and bank rejected. THE BANK WILL NEVER REJECT A REFUND, not only that but they dont even have the capability of rejecting any refunds. They ignore me on why they lie and tell me to wait for a call so they can give me a gift card…basically to make sure they keep the money.",0

"ok but doesnt work well with viasat sat dishes. (had to ping Bezos- yes, he is available- or his office is, unlike most CEOs...) 3-4x to fix issues caused by my ip bouncing all over the states.corporate responce -once you get it- is decent. customer support doesnt know which language you speak half the time(1and1 fr email server didnt help).shipping from some merchants is like snake oil for some reason. ask for nose nettle and you'll see what I mean. can hardly fault amazon for that.however the DRM has got to go. too many issues with kindles and resetting them and not working stuff that DRM is making you buy all over- im not happy about that.+1 is that the kindle functions- when the cord is modified- as an original xbox memory card.",1
"Sharp decline in assistance. When I started using Amazon about a year ago my main concern was if I could return items if they didn't work out. I tore up my knee and can't get out to do my purchases and Prime seemed to be a fine option aat that time. I could use Prime video and returns were easy. I could take my return to the UPS store half a blck away and they would print my label, scan the item and done!  Recently everything has changed for the worse. They no longer use the same courier company and all the options for drop off are too far for me due to the mobility issues. The free pick up option looks fine until you spend the entire day waiting for the pick-up only to get notified at 9pm that you have been rescheduled for the next day. This goes on for days sometimes. I'm sorry, you wanted to shower or take your dog out to pee? Too ordinary. Most recently I recieved the okay from customer assistance to leave my pick up at the door and when I got out of the shower they had only picked up one of the two items that were in the same box. By the way, contacting customer assistance is almost impossible. Good luck finding the link to request a call or actually talking to a person. The AI call doesn't give you the option to talk to a person, you have to know to say ""talk to a person"". The chat doesn't actually chat, it is just more self help. They don't want to know what their customers think.Then there is Prime Video. All the shows I was watching suddenly came with a price tag. The garbage that was left has comercials and isn't worth watching. I haven't watched anything on Prime for weeks. I bought one movie that I will say finebye to if I cancel but it may be worth it.As for the items, hit or miss as usual. If I am familiar with a brand and it works for me it is usually a safe bet. Otherwise it definitely is a gamble.",1
Used to be poor service and couldn't care less attitude but they've totally turned themselves around and are now THE place to shop online.,2
"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience. I don't know seller, if he is not responding you, I bought it because of your trust, Order number :- 403-3552607-1022716Deepak #amazon #onlineshopping #scammersALERT #amazonsale #amazondeals #AmazonCustomer #amazoncheat",0
Could do better. Not always the most practical option for the purchase of decents. When multi buying a compromise on post and order should be considered.,1
Got some good deal from Amazon.com,2
Some of their market companies are not reliable and apperintly Amazon takes little to no responsibility.  Been waiting on an order forever.   Wish the company would at least contact me.,1
"Bought - Chums | Mens | Fleece Lined Thermal Water Resistant Outdoor Trouser Pants | Charcoal from an Amazon Seller. They are faulty as there is excess lining in one leg making them difficult to get on. Tried to return them but they are stated as ""not eligible for return"". Their returns policy does not explain anything. This is against my statutory rights and I cannot get any explanation or  information from Amazon as to how to return them and get a refund. Spoke to Amazon on their CHAT line which is automated just to get confirmation that the goods are not eligible for return. Still don't know why. Will not be buying clothes from Amazon again.",0
"I made an amazon account because i was given an amazon gift card. I purchased a roblox gift card using the amazon gift card, and my amazon account was locked because somehow me buying a roblox card is suspicious. Whatever. I put in my information to get my account unlocked, and a few hours later, my account still wasn't unlocked. However a new notification appeared when i tried to log in saying they reviewed the information i sent but they still need more. It said to follow the instructions in the text message they sent me, but the text message they sent me tells me to log in, but when i log in it tells me i need to follow the text message instructions. Makes sense? No? Great because i was confused too. The text message had no ""instructions"". I called customer service and the tl; dr is ""sorry idk how to help u lol bye"". I thought i would just try again and make a new account, so i did. I tried to load my gift card again and it said the gift card was locked.Tl; dr - amazon locked my account the moment i tried to buy something, and froze my amazon gift card essentially stealing 25 dollars from me with no hope of getting it back.How can you avoid an experience like this?Dont buy from amazon. Buy from the home store of the sellers on amazon. Not only does it keep money out of greedy bezos's pockets, not only can it be cheaper than buying from amazon, but it also helps you avoid every single painful moment i spent on the amazon website. This was quite literally the worst experience ive ever had while on the internet. Dont ask for amazon gift cards for your birthday or christmas. Ask for visa gift cards. Theyre like amazon gift cards except you can buy anything, not just amazon stuff.Final thoughts - my first impressions of amazon are as followed: amazon scammed me out of my money, if your account gets locked (which i guess happens every time you try to buy something?) just give up and delete your account because you aren't gonna get it back. Did you have gift cards loaded onto that account? Say bye bye to that money because you just got scammed. Avoid amazon at all costs.",0
"Amazon generally is good and I have been a customer for a number of years. My only gripes have been down to the size of packaging used compared to the size of the item (and the environmental impact this has) and the laziness of their drivers/couriers who often do not ring the bell when I am at home, don’t always put the package through letterbox when it would fit and instead just leave on the doorstep.",2
"I have been a customer of amazon.com for a long time. I am overall satisfied with its supports. However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer support to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service has had a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.",1
"Fifth time in a row that a preorder has been delayed or changed. Says it comes out today but won’t ship til A MONTH (actually two months) after release, but yet it tells me it’ll be here Monday. I was also lied to by CS for the $10 coupon. Was also told ticket was escalated and will be shipped in 24 hrs (I highly doubt it). They tried to deflect asking where exactly it says it’ll show up on that day when it’s RIGHT ABOVE THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF THEM! I don’t what’s going on with their preorders but it’s gotten to be god awful. I get news that other people that order at the same get theirs but yet mine gets delayed. It’s getting to when I just cancel all my orders and don’t use you all as a place holder til I find it somewhere else. They just turning into a joke of a company",0
"Amazing, have been buying for a while now. Great prices compared to others. Next day delivery is a game changer. Customer service are second to none if you ever encounter any problems. Prime subscription for the extra benefits is well recommended. Top marks guys.",2
The customer support was acceptable.  The background noise at the call center was horrible.  I couldn't hear myself think when I had to answer the questions.  I felt like someone was shouting over me.  I've designed call centers for years.  I can tell when employees are sitting on top of each other without any sound attenuation.  It made my customer support interaction really unpleasant.  They need to do better.  They are Amazon and they are taking over the world.  They have money for better call centers.,1
"Bought some stuff as gift for my friends in the US. I used my Ireland credit card and the gifts were delivered on time and in perfect condition! The fx rates aren't the best in the market (actually, they are a bit bad). So thats something you might want to look out for! Sometimes, it might be worth paying in your own the specific currency than in your own currency, as yopu bank might offer you a better rate. But I would definitelky deal with them again",2
I absolutely love amazon!!!!!! I can find everything I need there.I haven't had any problems with my orders mostly because I always make sure to read the reviews so I know if the product is as advertised. Its best to spend a couple extra bucks on a product that has a lot of reviews and customer pictures than one that has the same product but no review at a lower price. Most cases its still cheaper than in store.,2
"i only buy from trusted companies and i have never had a problem. My packages arrive nice, neat and timely. If not timely even through no fault of amazon they have credited my account to a discounted price of the order more than once when postal issues come about during the delivery. They always try to make things right I have used this site to order things from phones,computers,tvs,kids toys, movies, watches, decorations, party supllies, etc you name in 15 years I have got it hereYour Prime member truly Ashlee",2
"I have an expert experience as a buyer at Amazon,Ebay,Aliexpress and Banggood and I have to admit that Amazon is much better than every competitive.It's the only one that you can trust 100% about buyer protection.That's the reason that the prices are a little high than the average.",2
"I like shopping through Amazon but this last interaction might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the order really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for order people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, order person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1
"The absolute worst customer service I’ve ever dealt with, I return a $2000 item because it was incomplete and Amazon has waited over 30 days to give me my refund on the merchandise because they have yet to check it in so therefore I have to pay interest on my credit card of an item that I returned because of their screwup.",0
"This company is going to crash and simmer out of existence. The people who work there are lazy and jealous of the former CEO. These people are greedy and feel entitled to have what they see others having, even though they lack the brains and ingenuity to even come close to having that kind of success. So these Customer Service clowns, whom are predominantly f**oreign, have no care to provide any type of good service. 90 percent of the time they will hang up on you after you ask a simple question. This is a problem of s**tupid American companies who choose to hire humans who h***ate us to handle our company profiles. Keep the Customer Service Representatives in America. Otherwise you get people who intentionally run down the company.",0
"Everything about Amazon is great, even customer service, if you can find them. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that they make you jump through hopes to call customer service. I got an email stating I didn't return an item I return a month ago. I had to login and search the website for 5 min in order to send them my phone # so they can call me back? This actually made the phone call easier because i didn't have any phone prompts and it took 2 min to fix everything. But why was it so hard to figure out how to contact them?",2
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the shipment. Then they give you an approximate shipment date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1

"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has fine infrastructure (fast order, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1
"Well, I never thought I would be writing a negative review about Amazon. After many years as loyal customers, and being a Prime member for many years, spending a lot of money, I find myself writing a negative review.Whilst being Prime members we have never had problems with faulty, not as described, not received goods, etc. Now we have cancelled out Prime membership, the customer service and customer support has become sub-standard. It just shows that you are not treated equally and there is no equality.If we had a problem with an item, the money was refunded either as soon as the item was returned or within a very quick period of time. Now we have cancelled our Prime membership, we have had nothing but trouble getting a simple refund for an item that was clearly sold '!s new' but was infact 'ex-display' and not as described. This is a clear cut case and should have warranted an immediate refund.After contacting the seller and getting no response, then one response, and no further response, we contacted Amazon. There was excuse, after excuse. They eventually said they would refund the money and said it will be in your account, but it wasn't.So bearing in mind they said they had refunded it! Two days later they send a message saying, ""your A-Z claim has been successful and we will be refunding you payment."" So the initial refund they said they had refunded, they had not actually refunded it. Now I will have to wait another 7 days for a refund. In total that will be 15 days from the item being received back by the seller.Why would you receive lesser customer service than a Prime member? Surely, all customers should receive the same customer service, after all we are all customers. Why is a non-prime member discriminated against? We are disgusted and disappointed in the service we have paid for, and this is not the experience we have become accustomed to over the many years with amazon.We have spend thousands of pounds with Amazon over the years. This will probably the last time we purchase from Amazon, and we will be closing both of our accounts with Amazon.",0
I've ordered books from here several times and overall it's ok. But the shipping if very expensive and long,1

Just woah!,2
"Amazon has gotten to be one of the worst companies ever. They very Notorious liars. There delivery team constantly say they have delivered something and have not only for it to be delivered next day. Prime is not worth it no more. You pay for the service and it says your items will be delivered the next day only to be delayed a week and this is not a one time thing. It has happened to every delivery I have had in the last couple of months. Cancel your prime or stop shopping from Amazon. There prices are not much different no a days than any other competitor. I loved Amazon once upon a time and now I’m very disappointed at them. Like now, I was told my delivery was 3 stops away. Got off early to be here not 2 hours later no delivery be cause now the driver have to go make several more stops before coming to me. My order got pushed back while he was shopping at the mall literally 2 mins from my house. I could see him on the map for 2 hours at the mall. Go figure! Screw Amazon. Trump should shut you down. I’m not even a fan of him but I agree with this.",0

"I have found Amazon to be one one the most difficult businesses to deal with. Their web site is very confusing to try to use. They currently have no telephone customer service so you cannot get your questions answered and their on-line help on their web site is, as I already stated, very confusing. They are very quick to charge your credit card that keep on file and very slow to issue credits or they just don't issue the credits they tell you they will issue and you then have to waste more time trying to follow-up with them or you have to contest the charge they put on your credit card. The services and products they offer are real good, but if you need customer service from them forget-about-it. Very frustrating.",0

I bought a part from a company on Amazon and received the wrong part I went with another sales site and the part came from the same seller. Wrong part again. I gave a 1 star review so nobody else would go through the same 2 week problem I did Amazon would not post. They only want good reviews. Well don't ask for my review again !

When you call them the first time they say it is a system glitch and should be fixed in 24 hours. And as you can imagine it never happens.  Attempting to reset that over their 800 number is just waste of your time. I spent several hours on the phone with them. I gave them all the information they needed including the phone #, credit card numbers, billing address, email, last transaction codes from my bank statement but this is not enough!  They ask you to name last three purchased items and if you do not remember the exact names of the items you purchased  you can not pass their security check!  Is not this weird? These guys become crazy. I am not going to use them any more. I hate all that. And I feel sorry for my time and nerves.",0
I am going to summarize my experience. They lost my package...they only offer your refunded money to a gift card not back into your bank/credit card. They do NOT tell you the truth from the beginning. I called within five minutes of ordering to change the address..instead of saying no they ask the address and said it would be delivered to the amazon locker that I ALWAYS use. Logistics reps are liars..all of them are liars! They didn't Change the address because then they offered to send my package to an address that was within 1 mile...waited...no delivery...next day..I get a message which said cannot access the facility for delivery. IT'S A HOUSE!!...Come to find out THEY NEVER CHANGED THE ADDRESS!!! LIARS!!! I called 3 days in a row...first...second...and third day of shipment to confirm everything so it wouldn't be a problem...STILL THERE WERE PROBLEMS...they kept switching me to reps that lie or could not really help the situation. The last rep kept me on hold so long and hung up! I called my bank. They will be handling the problem. AMAZON IS CRAP WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,0
It's really hard to return items I almost rather take the loss on the ordinary purchase,1
"While somethings are decent on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their shipment drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything average they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1
Earlier I was happy but this time my parcel come late and the item's price was a lot a bit high.,1
"Prices are fine, and I've had fine usage with customer assistance. Whenever I had an issue, they just refunded, no questions asked. Overall I'm happy with them.The problem is the purchasing usage and scammers. The web UI can get very confusing, mixing new and used in the same page, sometimes a single listing is from a certain buyer, sometimes there are several, and so on. Can get lost easily.A big issue is with scams/fake reviews. Lots of listing are full of reviews for a completely different item. Sometimes the same listing includes different items, and others the seller switched items and kept all reviews. Very hard to tell which items are fine or ordinary based on that.",1
"I have purchased from Amazon for years but recently decided to go with ""Prime"" and I could kick myself for not doing it many years and dollars ago!  Silly me.  And the Subscribe & Save Program is genius!  Now I order even more - for less price and free shipping.   Love it!",2
"Fed up with poor customer service. No recourse for late arrivals and making me jump through hoops to prove orders were late when all information is in their system. The past 4/6 orders have been late and 1 of those never arrived. On one occasion have they offered me a FIVE DOLLAR CREDIT that can only be used on Amazon sold items which are basically non-existent for anything useful to me or relative to my shopping habits. The membership prices have increased only to offer worse customer service and worse shipping times. In this day and age it is almost just as easy and price efficient to shop on eBay. It won't be too much longer until that is fully accurate statement. I am done with the inconveniences and greedy tactics of Amazon which I used to admire as a company. I am fed up, and done. Please do not enable Amazon to rip us customers off and spend your money elsewhere.*I called about my most recent order being late I'm, to follow up about the previous recent orders, and cancel my membership. I spoke with supervisor ""Carla"", after being escalated from a first level rep due to no recourse, and we conveniently got ""disconnected"". During the call they stated they couldn't even cancel my membership. They would provide a link to which I could service the cancellation myself. How lazy? I guess I'm expected to reconsider while taking the time to jump through hoops to cancel. Afterward I receive a message that states she has applied a $40 credit to my account that I can only use on Amazon items, but without a proper conversation and acceptance from the customer. $40 credit for $1000+ worth of late equipment over 5 orders. How convenient it must have been to be disconnected from a ""problem"" customer, and be able to employ such shoddy customer service. My 8 year tenure with prime ends today.",0
Their prices aren't really too competitive anymore. The shipping has gotten pretty ordinary shipping through USPS. Common sense says not to ship through such a dysfunctional government run shipment support. I've had packages delayed and even packages not show up when shipped through USPS when ordering from Amazon. When they use their own shipment people and UPS or Fedex there's no problem. But since things get shipped through USPS there's no way to get compensation or any kind of resolution to USPS's incompetency.,1
i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early,2
"Fast and efficient shipment, (prime customer). However, Prime Day deals are a rip off really, some items only a marginal discount and only ever seem to really push their own items!!",1
But I won't act on it because the prices and delivery time is too good :\,2
"Beware of ordering things you might need to return.  Although I  ordered a ""Prime"" item, returns and refunds guaranteed, you may end up having to pay postage to Quanzhou Fuhian or some other country through the postal service.  They claim you'll be reimbursed for postage, but who knows how long that will take or how much it will be!!!",0
So I ordered a bunch of stuff and I waited for days for the delivery. I called them and asked them where is my order and they said it was delivered? I didn’t receive anything and it was a bulky order so I was confused how it can be lost or stolen? I asked the customer service man to contact the driver and he said they can’t do that. A massive company like that? So I requested a refund because I didn’t receive my items. I got the refund and today I receive a pathetic email from the ofc specialist team saying that they may close my account because deliveries don’t go missing like that blah blah. I’m confused exactly what are they accusing me off? I’m not a thief and I always pay my way but if my items were not delivered I have every right to a refund. And then ti get this stupid email has really pissed me off. I have been a loyal customer to them for years no more. Disgusting service from a huge company like Amazon!,0
always manage to find what i want,2
Customer support almost impossible to reach even for expensive purchases.,0
"Rubbish pathetic wrapping material.I bought a Paper Mache bird with hearts attached and Amazon decided to post it to me in a Cardboard Stiff Envelope?No wrapping around the object to cushion it, nothing.",1
You're lucky you're getting a 1. Amazon is now part of the United States of China. You work with a company like Google that has apps that literally sells slaves in Kuwait but you won't allow an app that allows freedom of speech.

Can't wait to use my amazon gift card!!! From Swagbucks!!!!,1
"I have been an Amazon Prime member for at least 15 years and until the past 6 months to a year, I would have given Prime a 5-star review.  However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day order any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the assistance altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the assistance gets any worse.  I truly hate to see this happening because Amazon Prime has been a lifeline for me for years...my go-to when I needed something shipped to me fast and reliably.",1
Good delivery on time nd best price Thankew amazone,2

Service is worse these days and prices too,1
"I've been a Prime customer for somewhere between 7 to 9 years now? Weekly in fact. As a small business person since 1995, and one in hospitality, I deal with human beings of every personality type, many nationalties, backgrounds, etc. What it makes you in the end, is a very fair person who because one is also the target of unfair reviews, you develop a sense of propriety and how to manage issues or turn lemon into lemonade. To this day, Amazon has never attempted to discuss lemons into lemonade. They just like to keep you sucking their sour ways of not dealing with something or admitting they're in the wrong, and ignoring you with just citing vague company policies. So the matter at hand is that I've always left constructive reviews, and rarely have said anything critical or disparaging about a product and as a filmmaker who has actually made a documentary film, I give just as much fairness to filmmakers when reviewing shows or movies I've watched on Amazon. Which is why it made absolutely no sense whatsoever when they cut off my ability to leave any reviews of any kind. And perhaps the ultimate hypocrisy of their system is that with every delivery, they want me to leave reviews about their drivers? Or if I've had other issues with products, and there's been some sort of customer service interaction, they want me to review that? Makes no sense. Now bear in mind I've contacted them over and over on this issue, but each and every time, they've never satisified the original problem with any explanation or any other possible path to recovering or restoring our client to client relationship. Instead, they just want you to bow to them and keep on paying them to be disrespectful of yourself and insult your intelligence through and through. Welcome to corporate America.",0
"I'm happy dealing with Amazon as a customer, but not as someone who's applied to work for amazon. Watching videos on YouTube I heard nothing but bad things working with Amazon. Despite those negative reviews I just looked at it as a opportunity. Anyway make long story short my drug test was screwed up I made arrangements to take another one, gave up six hours of my day, and since I just been getting the run around. Well todays the deadline. I don't even work for them and I'm having problems, I can only imagine the problems I would have if I do work for them. But I'm done with trying to get a job with them, things work out for the better and this is a sign that this probably isn't the job for me. Anyway it's time to let go and move on.",0

"""Amazon has truly revolutionized the way we shop online. The platform offers an incredible variety of items, from everyday essentials to niche items that are hard to find elsewhere. The user-friendly website and app make browsing and purchasing a breeze. With features like one-click ordering and Prime membership benefits, such as fast shipping and access to streaming content, Amazon has set a high standard for convenience. However, sometimes the sheer number of options can be overwhelming, and there have been concerns about the treatment of workers in their warehouses. Overall, Amazon remains a go-to destination for shopping, providing a seamless usage for customers worldwide.""",1
"Just got off the phone with Amazon. If you ever follow their instructions to cancel a shipment that has been shipped via Amazon Logistics, don't. If they always ship to you via their Amazon Logistics, think about it seriously. If the courier marks the package as ""refused"" and doesn't return it to an Amazon facility, Amazon will try to refuse the refund if one of their ""top notch"" couriers decides you don't need the item but they do. According to Amazon Customer Service, I am responsible for THEIR courier. I don't remember that job interview..",0
"They are ok for items you know cannot go wrong , however don’t buy electricals, they only offer 4 week guarantee and returning anything is a nightmare !! I am a regular customer but that counts for nothing ",0

THIS COMPANY IS TOO CORRUPT TO IMPROVE. THEY SELL HEALTH HAZARD PRODUCTS. AND JUST A JUNK!!!,0
My package was supposed to be delivered on Sunday which has not arrived yet. I keep getting is excuses when I call. This is highly frustating and worst service i ever had with Amazon. Please do not use amazon services for delivery since their agent might steal the products order by customers like us and they customers have to call amazon and inquire about products.,0
Amazon has the best customer service ever!!!,2
"My go to online shop. I have never been wronged by Amazon and I've been buying from them for years now. They always get my items to me on time but usually, faster than expected. Love em!",2
Normally very fine but the last 2 orders have not gone well one never arrived and other came damaged managed to get they swapped but it took allot of emails and hassle might shop local going forward,1
"I recently made a purchase, of a blender. It is working pretty fine. I really find it worthy",1
being a prime customer doesn't work 80% of the times! paying the prime membership for nothing...i gave up on buying certain items from amazon because they never come on time.,1
"What an absolute waste of space of a company!! How in the world can Jeff bezos be one of the richest men in the world when his company is an absolute joke. Time and time again my parcels have not been delivered. The whole workforce is full of sausages and absolute morons with no respect for anyone and then they wonder why they're delivering boxes to people's doorsteps (supposedly), for a living. If I saw an amazon van in a head on collision I would only stop to laugh at them and reclaim my long lost parcels that seemed to fall off the face of the earth.",0
"After complaining to customer assistance, I was reassured this would not happen ... Amazon customer care number.....",1
"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic goodss for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer support every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
Amazon can be decent but when its ordinary its ordinary. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1

"I have been an Amazon Prime customer for years and since they started their own delivery the service is terrible.  Packages are routinely delivered late (no sure what Prime is doing for me).  They also leave packages in the worst locations.  Today for instance they left my package in the middle of my driveway where my dogs can get to it instead of by the front door.   In another instance last week they claimed they delivered my packages and handed them directly to the resident at 9:08 am.  Hard to do when my wife and I are working at that time, they were just left in the middle of the driveway.  I love Amazon but their delivery is enough to make me think about finding a different service.",0
"For two years I have had nothing but great interaction with Amazon, until two months ago when I received notice that I had ordered ( unknown to me) a $100 reload of a gift card, then received a notice that I would be receiving two $50 play stations I ordered (unknown to me). I tried dealing with the customer assistance reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer assistance rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really? I will miss the convenience of ordering online but not the nightmare of trying to deal with customer assistance that can't fix a problem or don't care enough to try.",1
I order from amazon.com all the time! My hubby says I'm addicted...I admit it! They have everything you can think of and always ship on time! Amazing company.,2

I like Amazon but I think clothing could be better. Ordered few things online and quality was a bit low but very fast and reliable,1
This amazon.com is so great for those who are lazy to go outside of their comfort. You can just find and select the stuff you want and add to your cart then you are good to go! Just wait your order just a few days! good job and keep it up.,2
Many of the venders are selling their goodss for more than you can purchase them from the manufacturer or other outlets like Walmart. Some of the sales look more like gouging.,1
Amazon is going downhil. I have ordered from them for as long as I remember. I have prime membership but still packages are delayed and broken and then have to go to shop to return it and if you live in a village it is a big hassle specially when you don't have car and have to wait for buses.,0

"Vulgar through and through next day delivery load of rubbish, was supposed to be here today got a delivery time scale then it changed to alater time scale, says neighbours get delivery's from amazon courier but skipped my address, contacted vulgar amazon customer services and all I got was wait till 10pm wait till 10pm waited few hours longer went back through to be fobbed off again u till I demanded to make an official complaint got another useless waste of space advisor, who initially tied saying that delivery was attempted at 2.11pm soon changed their tune on that when advised them I have cctv and can prive otherwise, he offered to compensate for the vile service with delivery and offered and a massive insulting £5 credit on my account of course i told them to keep it. Moral of this story is don't bother paying for prime as your don't get ypur spaces next day as it states, miss selling at it finest well I will be reporting them. Thieves avoid them and don't not invest in prime, u don't get what ypy pay for.",0
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the shipment. Then they give you an approximate shipment date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1

"Amazon is so good about customer service and delivery.  (I love my Kindle Fire too.)This book is pretty amazing.  Another great resource for my husband and me to help with the good old IRS.  Over 40 years, we have only been audited twice.  The first time we were young and foolish in our business.  Now, we listened to the wrong people about our newly emptied nest and some investments we were told were deductions.  We knew it was too good to be true.  Hope this book helps.",2
"I have never had any problems with Amazon.  I have rarely had to return any items and when I have, the process has always been quick and painless. Most recently, however, they have sent me a book with about 30 pages stuck together. Instead of them sending me a replacement (which is usually what happens when I go through the return process), they have asked me to send this item back for a refund.  I ordered the book in the Black Friday sale at about £2.79.  The book has now gone up up £7.99.  There is no way I would pay full price for the book so I am now a Christmas present short.  I wish they would have just replaced it as it was their fault for sending a faulty product to start with.",2

The odd time there is something decent on prime tv but Amazon have gon downhill.If it is the shipment supports they use, then they need to change.",1
Ok i do understand that amazon is a third party involved but still amazon you all really need retrain some of your customer support reps and stop with the e-mails  or charging people's cards if their transaction was denied just automatically stop charging the card please because it signals the banks in a wrong way ok .,1
"Amazon is a great company with alot small problems, specially when it comes to vaguely answered customer support questions and those people have very limited power to help you with.And my most hated thing is the order status there should be more information and it should be more accurate.Other than that am happy with Amazon.",1
If I could I wouldn’t give them one star. I ordered an item that amazon swore it would ship within two days( we are now on day 14 and still the item hasn’t shipped. Was chatting with customer service and they disconnected with me!! That’s it I’m done!! From now on I will buy from eBay!,0

"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of usages with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only decent thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1
"I have never had anything negative to say about Amazon until this most recent usage.  I purchased a bunk bed online at a great price.  Well apparently it was priced incorrectly and they cancelled my order with out notifying me.  First I don't think it's best practice for a business not to honor their prices they list but Amazon covered that in their terms and conditions... but what about notifying me, that is mentioned in their terms and conditions?!!!  I ordered it several days ago.  Amazon's terms and conditions state that they will notify you.  Well they violated their contract.  I had plans for the bunk bed.  Now my granddaughters old beds will be picked up on Wednesday and they will have no bed!  Thank you amazon for not holding up your end of the bargain.  A purchase is a contract and I held up my end, they did not. Also they are not refunding me for 7-10 days so I can't even go to a store and buy a bed until they give me the money to.  This is by far the worst usage I have ever had with amazon.  And I have been an avid Amazon promoter and shopper for several years.  I will no longer provide them my business if they cannot operate with integrity and honor their end of the bargain.  Now my grandkids will be sleeping on the floor until I get my money! - Laura Sapp (269)491-1343",1
Always had good experience with amazon. well done,2
I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 items that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 item that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of items, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1

"Amazon customer service is Appalling!  I needed to return two damaged items and went through the returns process online.  The courier arrived on 3 occasions to collect them.  Each time with a car when, as items are heavy and bulky, a van is needed.  After each failed attempt I have contacted customer service by live chat and telephone.  Further collections were supposedly arranged with Hermes who didn’t turn up even after I waited in on days for them.  At this point I had contacted them at least 8 times.  The whole experience was utterly frustrating.  On 2 occasions the call was disconnected.  Eventually Amazon customer service told me I have to arrange my own courier and they will refund.  However, I tried again and, after explaining all the details again, this assistant said she went through to the large items department and had arranged the collection for the following Tuesday.  Again a courier didn’t turn up.  I tried to contact Hermes direct.  They only provide digital chat.  I inputted the parcels tracking number and waited about a week for a digital response which said they couldn’t locate the parcel.  I then went online to arrange my own courier.  The cheapest courier costs £126 yet the item cost £90.  I contacted Amazon again to check they would refund this large amount.  He said yes.  But as so many CS advisers have told me different things I don’t trust anything they say.  I am now left with two large and heavy items unlike want or can afford to fork out £126 for their return.  It definitely is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced and I will not buy anything through them again.",0

"My wife and I are dedicated Kindle fans and Amazon customers. They released the new line of Kindle's this week which made us both happy (it's the best e-reader out there and improving it even more is terrific) and a little frustrated. You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old. I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India. The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board. While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty.",2

Not much else to say. Amazon has everything you want and it arrives in only 1 or 2 days.,2
"I have been an Amazon customer for years. I order numerous products all throughout the year and their selection is PHENOMENAL. I am almost ALWAYS able to find what I need on the site. They offer brand new, refurbished/reconditioned and used products. The site is easy to navigate and has detailed, easy-to-use search options. You can save many items onto a personal wish list and also add items to your shopping cart to purchase at a later date, and you can add several shipping addresses and different payment options to your account.My most recent order included a Dolamee D5 brand Android TV box. I also ordered a wireless keyboard/mouse/remote combo to go along with it. I was under a 30-day Amazon Prime trial and so I got Free 2-day shipping on both items. (I was also able to find a HDMI to RCA/AV converter box on Amazon, since I have an older TV) All three items came within the 2-day shipping time-frame and they were packaged well. Everything worked like a charm with no problems whatsoever. Amazon always sends me reminders to review the products I purchase and I often do. In the rare case I ever need a replacement or refund, they make the process as simple and easy as possible. Amazon customer service is pretty good. They respond to my inquiry messages usually within 24 hours or less. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because there have been instances where the customer service I received resulted in an unfavorable outcome. This is extremely, extremely, rare, however, and does not occur anywhere near often enough to keep me from giving the site a high rating. I plan to continue to be an Amazon customer for many years to come.",2
"After This Incident I Will Request All The Consumer Who Are Regularly Purchasing From Amazon, Flipkart Or Any Other Online Platform, Should Take An Unboxing Video Or Should Not Buy From These People. I Ordered A Samsung Galaxy M12 And After Receiving The Delivery Of The Product I Received Detergent Soap Instead Of Samsung Galaxy M12, And The Customer Support Team Is Giving The Same Reply Everytime “Sir Our Investigating Team Has Investigated The Whole Incident And They Come To The Conclusion That We Have Sent Mobile Phone Only Not An Detergent Soap” This Was My Last Online Order And From Now Will Prefer To Support More Retailer's Rather Than These Fake Online Platform's",0

I call customer services and they say i have to wait till the 5th November incase it turns up. why have i got to wait , Surely they use computers to load up delivery vans and know what is in there . why dont they sent me another order that i can get next day and cancel original order. How hard is that to do, they are acting like a start up company with 10 year old's in charge. Very POOR !!",0
I will never use Amazon again ever. Tortured me with paperwork to reclaim Vat then didn't even supply a Vat invoice. They don't comply with EU law. Never again. I'll make an effort not to buy any of their products,0
My order appears to have been delivered but I haven't found it and after 4-5 days I receive the refund. thank you for this,2
"Through covid 19 you have been there and supported people who need it, very little delay on items thank you for everything amazon!",2
I recently had cause to review Amazon badly in light of a purchase and the amounts charged. Initially the response I received to the matter was uncompromising and involved a great deal of trouble for me. Since then the response from Amazon and their reseller has been overwhelming. The outcome being totally to my satisfaction and full points to Amazon and their Reseller.,2
"Most of items are in fine condition, but a few items are fake.Be careful.",1
i have found something that amazon don't sell.i am a laryngectomee and i was after a larysnorkel freedom so i could go swimming again but i can't find on anywhere and even on the lary page i can't even pay for it so if amazon don't sell one then i give up but other wise its a acceptable firm to buy from,1

For two days now I have been lied to by Amazon I placed an order and paid for delivery. This has not been done dispite Royal Mail saying they have tried but I haven’t been out the house and no ne has turned up at all and now there saying I have to collect it and I have paid for delivery Amazon have done nothing and now I have lost over £23.00 I’m totally disgusted with the service from both Amazon and Royal Mail this was an order for a 94 year old sick man I’m fumming,0
Probably the best way to get online productsYou need to become a prime member to get the best out of amazon Fast free delivery for all prime,2
"2nd time in as many months, that a driver leaked a significant amount of oil on the driveway. Poorly trained drivers with little common sense. Amazon needs to make an effort to educate its drivers. Last time, 4 in the morning waking the household up with very loud exhaust and came back twice due to being confused.",0
I like Amazon but I think clothing could be better. Ordered few things online and quality was a bit low but very fast and reliable,1
Ordered a gold plated chain for fancy dress party but got delayed in customs for two weeks due to brexit and hence pointless. Shouldn’t be advertised to be delivered as two days order,1
Brilliant good range of products,2
No they don’t like for you to return items I see but love for you to buy,0
"Told a parecel was damaged in transit and i would be refunded as hadnt received it. Only then to see on my account it had changed to parcel given to customer which it wasnt. Called and they refunded me . Still a little worrying where the items went . Seems like the drivers are on the rob, christmas time as well.  When i spoke to amazon they didnt seem to bothered .",0
"I ordered an Amazon Fire stick. It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an order confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the order status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new order date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer support and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the acceptables never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too. Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund interaction. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.",1
"If I could give amazon zero stars I would. This company was once good. Its now terrible.  Ordered a motorcycle jacket nowhere near the correct size. Sent the jacket straight back 2 weeks later still no refund , customer services are as much good as a chocolate fire guard.

"Well in June 14 2024 at 10:04pm an Ebike and lock for it where purchased on a fraudulent Amazon account WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Now unfortunately the account was made by a family member and they used my address for the order. When the items where delivered I returned it ASAP. NOW AMAZON DID send the refund for $418.74 back to my card however do to all the fraudulent activities going on in the world today I keep my card locked.  So I Did Not get my refund. Now I call Amazon and let them know what happened they are holding on to my refund now. All because the fraudulent account have more rights then using my card. I Gave Amazon ALL of the INFORMATION they asked for about the fraudulent account. Amazon keep emailing the fraudulent account like I have access to it. I don't I need that $418.74 more Jeff Bezos does. We live in a sick sick world. Amazon should verify with person that's name on the card is making the order before the order goes through. There should be a way to do that. I have had Amazon for years before this. I should have been asked by Amazon am I creating an new account and verify with me. All of that money they could make it safer if they cared to. Also, FIY the person who made the fraudulent account does not want me to get my $ 418.74 back. Is making codes for ordering on Amazon accounts and cards that hard to do? I would give 0 star if I could. ",0

"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic goodss for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer support every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
"Absolute worst company ever. Their customer service is terrible. I don’t know how they can possibly stay in business if this continues. In the past month, I’ve ordered 20 items. 5 of them have been late, 2 have been the wrong thing, and 2 never arrived. Of these 20 items, I’ve returned a total of 4 items. 2 because they were the wrong thing and 2 because they just were not what I was expecting.Of the two that never arrived, Amazon was so reluctant to refund me, they kept telling me to wait it out. The most frustrating thing was my orders showed if the item didn’t arrived by “__”date, then I should return and I would be refunded. When I did this, they asked me to wait longer. After reattempting this 3 times over the course of 6 days, each time they did the same thing. Finally, I was refunded. 2 other items I’ve chatted about and the reps have told me on separate occasions that I don’t need to return the item and I would be refunded. I then donated the items because they were what I needed, and a week later, I have no refunds. I chatted with their CS and they said I needed to return the items in order to be refunded. I told the reps that I didn’t have them anymore because I donated them since the last reps told me I didn’t need to return the items. You can guess how this ended… no refund. I told Amazon that I would send them a screenshot from the previous reps. They still would not refund me, they said that the other reps made a mistake and that I still would need to return the items. I am absolutely dumbfounded. These people just don’t get it. I’ve never seen a company contradict themselves more than Amazon. It is beyond frustrating. Their CRM system or whatever they use is horrendous. How terrible customer service that you don’t keep previous customer correspondence or stick to your word. It’s complete bogus. This company used to be pretty good, but now it’s the most frustrating company to purchase from. So sickening.",0
After a horrible experience with Walmart with a book order . I let my husband order the book thru Amazon account. Not only was the shipping fast . My book came in excellent sealed condition.,2
I like amazon but when I wanted to voice my opinion about a seller they would not post my review,1
"Good store, some goodss are poor quality others are great",1
"The worst customer service you can get in this world you will get it from AMAZON with no exception especially if you use the chat service.No transparency, lack of knowledge and communication skills. Hiring CS reps that do not fully speak the language of the country/region they are serving. All this to cut down the operations cost at the expenses of the Customer services! Agents keep transferring you from one queue to another without even informing you and every time you have to start all over again. HIRE CS REPS FROM THE COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE OPERATING IN. i.e if I'm using Amzon.com I want to be served by someone resides in the US, Canada, rep from Canada, if from India, I want to be served by rep from India, UK, rep from UK, Mars , rep from Mars etc. period!",0
"What’s their to complain about. Iv always had great customer service. Returns are soo easy, and with most stuff next day delivery you really can’t complain",2
Amazon is pretty fine.It's useful for cheeper price and fine quality items.,1
I do not have words to explain how excellent Amazon is.,2
I have been ordering from Amazon for years.  I have always gotten my items in a timely matter and the items looked exactly as promised.,2
"For the third time, my delivery was sent to the wrong address. Dumb courier even takes a picture of it and it’s not my door. All Amazon will do is refund my money and told me I now have time to go buy something at the store. What’s the point of ordering online to now only be rushed to the store to hopefully find the same thing before my nephew’s birthday party tomorrow. I spend money every month on Prime so I can go to the store and buy it at a higher price.....they suck.",0
Lots of my friends say they don't get 2 day shipping from prime. I not only get 2 day shiping I get like 24 hour shipping. I must live next to a shipping center. Lucky me!,2
"1) Amazon should have a shipping options. They have only 2 options, 1 which is 24 hours or less and is very expensive, 2 the normal shipping is 2-3 days and can be expensive for some ,like myself who would be willing to wait 7-18 days and pay much less for shipping.     I just made an order 22 days ago and the order was supposed to arrive Dec.23 in time for Xmas,in paying they asked if the UPS can bring my order on Saturday or Sunday, with a click option for each.I clicked ""not on Saturday"", they delivered it on SATURDAY when no one was home and the whole order package was returned to Amazon.22 days later I had to contact customer  support which were very nice in offering to give me back the same amount of money I paid them 22 days before, I am sure they do this and make many $$$millions simply on $Money free interest which they invest in Amazon free loans from we buyers.(I still have not yet received my refund)",1
"Never had a problem with Amazon before now but just got a message to say that my package is undeliverable due to damage and I'll get a refund,but if the package is damaged I would like the choice myself of inspecting the package and then rejecting it,I ordered demon screen de icer and how do I know that the driver has taken it and damaged the package themselves,won't be using Amazon again",0
I ordered Vileda Vileda SuperMocio 3 Action XL Mopp-och-hink-set at a discount. They never handled the order. When I contacted customer service they said it was due to a technical error. Once I tried to place a new order they doubled the price. And now they refuse to compensate or answer my messages.I lost valuable days due to this.Hereby I will stop buying from Amazon. Shame on you!,0

"Pathetic AmazonI ordered L'Oreal Professionnel Serie Expert Liss Unlimited Evening Primrose Oil, 125ml and De Fabulous Shampoo, 250ml and Conditioner Reviver Set, 250ml on 05/09/2018 and both delivered to me on 06/09/2018 through Amazon Prime Delivery.When I opened the packet, I found that the bottles were not properly packed (sellotaped here and there) and there was leakage also. Oil was coming out of bottle. In fact it seems that these bottles were packed by someone from Amazon after getting them returned by any other customer. In my opinion I had been delivered product already used/returned by someone else.I had clearly read the policy regarding return/refund at the time of placing the order and I knew that product was not eligible for return/refund but I was not sure that I would be delivered such kind of already used/returned by some else product. I needed these product on urgent basis therefore I decided to get them delivered through Amazon Prime delivery and I paid extra money for that but what I got? Already used products… I never expected it from Amazon.I have paid my hard earned money to Amazon for these products and now I got defective products. I sent an e-mail to Amazon mentioning the issues I faced and attached pictures of the same. Next day I got an e-mail that ""on verification it was found that the products were damaged therefore refund would be issued"" and I was asked to update my account details, I updated my account details and on the very next day I was informed that the refund could not be issued as pictures are not clear.I sent pictures and numerous e-mails again and again but all in vain. I tried to contact customer care but my number was blocked. I tried chat option and they informed me that after examining pictures they haven't found any damage in the products. Amazon already examined the pictures and accepted that the products were damaged and on re-examining Amazon found these products good..what a joke..Amazon making fool out of me. It is requested everyone not to shop from Amazon as it is a fraud company. Pathetic customer care service.I am from hospitality background myslf...this kind of customer services I or any of my friends have never offered to anyone ..you should be ashamed of being serving customers like the way you are..Highly appalled..I will never recommend Amazon to anyone.",0

"I have noticed the user interface for Amazon is HORRENDOUS!!! I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription which was so hard to get because you can't do it through the Amazon app or the KU app. I had to find a link through google...WHY SO HARD?? I also got a trial for Amazon music for a month which I cancelled. A few months later it AUTOMATICALLY took money out of my account for Amazon music. Why doesn't it ask you before it just takes money out. Any other place you buy things from it gives you a second to think before you actually get it, but no, not Amazon. WHY SO HARD??? I also tried to get my Amazon Prime Video on my phone which is under a different account but it will AUTOMATICALLY use the account all your other stuff is on but guess what. You can't just log out in one place. You have to  log out of EVERYTHING!! WHY SO HARD!!!! I'm surprised more people don't complain about this. Although Amazon offers a lot it is so difficult to manouver and actually find things through the apps that I keep having to ask google!! Pls hire a better IT team!!",0

A package that was to fat to fit through letterbox was left poking out of the door.  Don't shop from them unless the item won't fit through the letterbox however much the lazy driver rams it.",1
Worst customer ever as they could not deal with an item I bought and never received and had to cancel my subscription. Will stick to eBay as the customer service is excellent in terms of this situation. With all these bad feedback I’m seeing on here I’m surprised nothing has been done about it obviously they don’t really care.,0
"I buy a LOT of stuff from Amazon, but I've been frustrated for a while now on how their algorithm works for suggestions.  On the main page it recommends even durable goodss I've already purchased.  It continues to recommend goodss for months in which I show no interest.  Sometimes I'll click on something because I can't tell what it is from the picture and from then on, I keep getting it recommended.  I have cleared my ""history"" multiple times, but it always goes back to the lame recommendations.  The problem is in the algorithm used for recommendations and should be seriously reviewed.",1

I have always received products on time and their customer service was overall excellent.,2
I did not receive the order but AMAZON customer service keep saying they cannot do anything and wont solve my problem. Stupid thing is amazon prime member does not matter in this situation lol. What a shame after 20 years. GG. bye amazon. i wont waste my money and time with your bad customer services,0
recently I have not found amazon being an efficient company as a website. it has been very difficult to manage and I feel as if it is in need of an update! I will no longer be ordering from amazon until I feel as if it more efficient.,0
Ever since they started their own delivery Amazon has gone downhill. Packages never arrive on time and they keep delaying. A package that was supposed to be delivered by 3 pm is now 10 pm. I will be canceling any order that i see is not being delivered by UPS or Post Office,0
"Amazon DecrepitudeI had trouble deciding whether to choose one or two stars for my review.In the past you could count on Amazon customer reviews to help you sort out whether a particular item was any good or not. Reviews would tell you about user experiences; how well the product worked, whether there were warranty claim issues, whether the item was suitable for a task, or even if a particular  vendor was untrustworthy or not.However, Amazon started adding Ratings which are not Reviews, simply some useless, lazy person simply giving stars (1-5) without any reason for the rating. Some products have tons of ratings without a single useful note giving a reason for the rating. This is especially infuriating when it comes to reviewing books. You click on what you think is a review and it turns out to be a rating, meaning there is no reason given for the star assignment. This is not very helpful to help you decide if you would be interested in purchasing a book.Later on Amazon removed all of the Comments that customers used to give additional information or commentary on a particular Review. This meant that warning about certain vendors failure to ship products on time, substituting products, shipping used items that were supposed to be new, or explaining why the negative review was a user caused, rather than a product problem.Removing the Comments on Reviews means that a TON OF HELPFUL information is gone resulting in the customer REVIEWS, are no longer as informative and helpful.Of course the worse thing that Amazon had done starting at least 10 years ago is that they lump reviews of different products together, presumably to make it appear that there are more reviews than actually exist. Whenever you purchase an product, you are invited, and encourage to leave a review, which is tied to the purchase of the exact item you purchased so there is no reasonable excuse for claiming that it is hard to connect the review to the exact item purchased. Amazon has all of the data that is needed to do this right.One terrible example of product Review LUMPING are those for Computer Hard Drives (HDs). Amazon lumps the reviews for old generation small capacity 500 Gb HDs, with all hard drives   made by a particular manufacturer with the largest capacity 18TB HDs. Now, the lower capacity HDs were designed and manufactured many years ago, using very different designs and components than those  newest, ultra high capacity HDs. These newest HD's that are very different from the older HDs, and use components that were produced most recently. We know that batches of components of the same design made at different times in factories may have quality control issues, hence Amazon's LUMPING practice defies reason and is DISHONEST.  Amazon will no doubt claim that their filtering menu takes care of this issue, but in fact that is false. You cannot evaluate the percentage of negative reviews (such as adding the two lowest star ratings together) without having these required data easily available. These are not easily found without counting every review. I certainly do not have time to do that, nor should that be required of anyone wanting to understand the review ratings. This would not be a problem if products that are not identical were not LUMPED together.LUMPING is misleading, and seriously dishonest, making it extremely difficult to make choosing a reliable product from Amazon. This practice should certainly stop, and the Review Comments should be put back if possible, and certainly re-instated.I have complained vigorously with customers support and even tried contacting Amazon upper management without success. Do away with LUMPING and get rid of Ratings instead of having Reviews! What will it take to get Amazon to fix these issues ?",0

"We are Prime members and have received good service from Amazon over many years,,,,,,Until we decided to use their Morrisons food delivery. We placed order with Amazon on sat 4th Dec 2021 and we were informed of the same day delivery which we did not need so said that Sunday the 5th would be acceptable.We were allocated 2.00pm to 4.00pm delivery slot.We were informed it was out for delivery at 2.10pm.We were then informed at 4.00pm that the order was cancelled.We would have accepted a late delivery as we had waited in already.I am suspicious that if someone had picked it in the store and loaded it on a vehicle, why not deliver it a bit late. Did they actually pick it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am sorry to say that we will never shop in Morrisons again as we have sometimes in the past and it does put Amazon in a bad light.I think Amazon needs to move away from Morrisons....That food was for our evening meal which created a problem,,,,,",0
"I ordered an e-book (amazon.com) last evening, but after I pushed the button ’buy this book’ a small window appeared with the message that I already had bought this book a couple of years ago. This morning (26-1-’23) I got an email with an invoice confirming they had charged me for an e-book I didn’t buy because according to Amazon’s records I owned it already. I cancelled the ‘order’ with a request for refund. Amazon immediately started the refund-process. So far so good, were it not that Amazon (.com where my initial account is registered and all e-book purchases) removed the book in the library of my device (the one I already owned). As a frequent customer of Amazon's very 1st hour I loved shopping there (mainly books, paper versions & e-books). Its Customer Service used to be excellent. It was approachable by email, people working there understood what the problem was. Now it turned into a sheer nightmare. There is a chat option which is a complete waste of time. Spent exactly 2 hours reading hollow niceties such as “I really apologize for the inconvenience” and “I understand your concern regard the e book” and repeated ad nauseum, but the person was unable to offer a solution because he/she just didn’t understand what the issue was. After exactly 2 hours I stopped the chat because I had to attend a meeting.  A company that sells products under its own responsibility should have a well-functioning customer service. Refunds are not always the only solution. In my case I want to know where the (paid for) ebook is I bought a couple of years ago. The amount Amazon refunded today is the amount they charged me yesterday. Not for the book I already had and which they removed today. Just imagine a transaction with a much higher-priced product and a de facto defunct customer service. Inadmissible practices, Amazon!",0
"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!",1

I ordered a thermometer over seven weeks ago and there is no option in the app to ask a representative if they have more information, or to contact the seller.

Now it just says “we’ll email you when it’s available” instead of estimated delivery timeline. What? The amount of dodging any type of potentially helpful interaction would actually be funny if I hadn’t spent money on this item as a gift for someone because, you know, they actually needed it or anything!",0

"Have ordered from Amazon UK no less than 5 times in the past 6 months and have received my products each time in good condition, with regular updates and fairly speedy delivery (even in Covid19 times). Prices could be better but I guess you pay a little more for convenience.",2
"Horrible service! It has taken 7 days waiting for a refund and not nothing yet, when I contacted them, I was informed that the cancellation had not been processed and it will take another 7 to 10 days. This purchase  was done using the EBT card for an elderly person who needs the money to be able to purchase her food. BAD service and irresponsible Will NOT use their services again",0
"WHY YOU DON'T FIRED THIS GUYS WORKING FOR AMAZON !!!!????   I enjoyed buying things from Amazon, but now , no more. I'm even afraid to make more orders , because they still the packages after they take de picture and lately they delivered my orders to the other neighbors door. After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1
I have had only one issue in almost 15 years of using Amazon and find it a place to find everything and anything. When I have returned items I have no problems at all.,2
"So completely disappointed in what Amazon has become, which is completely unreliable with shipping, regardless of how you place your order. We placed a very large order before our vacation and had requested that our products be delivered on the same day in 1 package, as an Amazon prime member. The website stated that our products had been delivered when they had not actually arrived. When we called to see what the problem was, our order was cancelled leaving us scrambling to find the items we had ordered, the day before we leave. I have been a prime member for YEARS and have experienced this same problem too many times and should have known better than to trust this company. I will NEVER order from Amazon again and will be cancelling my prime membership. The stress that their lack of efficiency has created is not worth it to me. We will shop elsewhere. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Get your act together Amazon!!! People depend on you and you are FAILING!!!",0
"Amazon was always my go to, mainly because of the 2 day shipping. The order times have been very inconsistent for the past few months and a few items were canceled even though notifications were sent that the merchandise was out for order. Seriously considering not renewing my prime membership...",1
What a waste of space Amazon is sent a Xbox game out to me to open the item to then notice that disc is scratched I then got onto Amazon to be able to return the item witch I have done and now I have to so called wait till 3feb 2023 robbing me outa my own money,0
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve items with so-so quality,1
"I've ordered through this website a bunch of times and i've never experienced any problems doing so. Some of the products can be of lower quality but when you pay 5 dollars for a product that's normally much more expensive you can't expect anything else. Great site, great prices and decent delivery time. Big ups for Amazon.",2
I'm always really happy when I purchase goods from Amazon..they are packaged well..delivered quickly..updated on deliveries and the drivers are polite.,2
"What a garbage company, glacially slow order processing and shipping even before the corona virus. Orders being marked as shipped even though they haven't. Zero customer support and it's a 1000% worse if you are a seller. Combine that with how they treat their warehouse employees you should do anything possible to avoid buying from them, or at least avoid the amazon fulfillment stuff and buy from marketplace sellers. 1 star for being able to return some items to my local Kohls store.",0
"I had a quite good experience with Amazon, the purchase process was smooth.Shipping expectation has to be slow when you buy multiple products.",2
Amazon a company that started great but has sadly got to big and is now getting terribly unreliable.My experience with Amazon and I don't use them a lot was awfull?I ordered two item's  a 2020 calender and a saint bernard design hoodie.The first item the calender I was informed was damaged in transit so I was refunded.The second item the saint bernard design hoodie I was told was running late.Two weeks later I used online chat to see how the order was progressing.It was explained to me that the item had been left in the Amazon locker as I'd asked them to do but had now been returned to Amazon as I had failed to collect the item.At no time was it ever explained to me the item was in the locker or any code sent to access the locker.I was offered the useall sympathetic approach and £5 to make it all better I which I refused.i didn't want £5 I wanted my item's they were presants for my partner.After this experience I would be very reluctant to use Amazon's services in the future?,0
"Experience with the web site fine and shipment hit and miss from next day promised  to 3 days, main complaint is with their Card which is run by New Day received a call  from Newday asking personnel questions did not know them the so refused to give details.Looked on Amazon card to find was New day. Rang customer supports on first attempt not got to a person. 2nd time spoke to a very pleasant customer support person  only to find out I had been charged £12 and £5 for late payment. I have not received any statement by e-mail and they don't send in post. I note this has happened to others just a way of making money.",1
I purchased prime membership 6 months before. Most of the times my items are delivered late.It says that it will be delivered tomorrow but it gets delivered day after tomorrow or even late sometimes.,1
"I have been an Amazon customer since the mid 90's. I don't expect any company to be 100%. Amazon is so big now they just aren't trying. Kindle software stinks the past year, customer assistance is unavailable, and no one in charge cares further than the stock price. I was a huge fan. Now I am looking for the competition.",1
They have a really good customer service where they care and are very helpful and friendly!,2
The site is a mess but the customer service is usually efficient and the returns are easy!,2
"Used to be good, lately there is more and more cheap chinese crap on there for sale, any problems past 30 days and Amazon wash their hands and fob you off with contact the seller but offer no way of contacting the seller. Don’t waste your time or money getting scammed on Amazon",0
I have used Amazon about 5 times and they have never delivered what i ordered. There is always something wrong. They really need to improve and stop selling sub standard goodss.,1
"Amazon don’t care about consumer rights.  I bought a lawnmower, after I bought it they bumped the price by £170, then told me it was lost in transit.  Really how can you lose a lawnmower.  The refused to send a replacement, but offered a refund, which meant that I would have to pay an extra £170 to buy it again,  Really dodgy selling practises.  And a clear breach of my rights to get a replacement,",0
"Amazon have long been my preffered site for ordering books, as they give a fair price for new books with the option of nearly new and used books at great prices. Now I have started using the site for toys, brands and more; the service is great, the delivery times very quick and I have even returned items just because I didn't want them at no quibble at all. Versatile site for searching for presents for children and adults alike, a must have site at your command.",2
I needed to change my phone number on file because i could not access the amazon store app. It is not an easy process at all. They wanted me to send a copy of my GOV issued id card? well that is not gonna happen. Paypal actually helped me change my phone number without asking for my id card. Cancelling amazon and moving on they are not what they used to be.,0
"I absolutely love Amazon because they’ve made life so much easier, as well as countless others.  There have been a couple of unpleasant experiences but it’s to be expected when most of all my gazillion purchases are Amazon.  In rural areas, Amazon does there best to get packages to customers but expecting 2 day deliveries is unrealistic, 4 days has been the maximum time I’ve waited.  To lift the burden off Amazon, if I didn’t need the item, I’d click on standard shipping but the packages came quicker than if I didn’t have prime.  My hope is that Mr. Bezos opens an Amazon distribution center in Niagara Falls and a kiosk retail store would bring lots of people from the entire WNY area and Canada.  Niagara Falls is ripe for a business like Amazon because there’s a lot of open space and from an economical standpoint, a steal.  My daughter in NYC said Amazon Fresh is “lovely”, a word she has never used to describe a retail food delivery service.  Thank you for reading my review.",2
"It is reliable, fast and efficient. Refund is never an issue if you don;t like the goods delivered. It has a whole variety of goods for all customers. It is the best online shopping gateway.",2
You can find almost everything is Amazon,2
"This is a second review I am writing for Amazon, in order to clarify their biased reviews filtering and complete lack of transparency in regard to users' opinions showing various item defects.I have attempted to publish a review regarding the dysfonctionality of Victron Energy MPPT 75 15 BT device. Three times. With video pointing the defect. None of the three attempts were ever published and no feedback was returned to me regarding the potential reasons for refusal. ",1
"My order was meant to be delivered yesterday, now delayed for another a couple of days. Tracking my order, but it says is still in Luton Dunstable to be dispached to my address in London.  At least they have notified me of the delay.",1
The item arrive within 3 business day.  they even give me a tracking number.,2
"What ever I m looking for, I ve always found at a great price and prompt shipping with secure tranactions. Their offering of various modes of payment and shipping addresses works for me.",2
Everyone knows Amazon.  With prime you get next day delivery- whats not to like?,2

What Amazon is doing is to make money on your return by holding your money for 30 days or more.SHAM ON AMAZON,0
"Multiple Issues:1. Chronically late and sometimes lost shipments due to trusting the USPS.2. Recently attempted to read a book I had bought months before- The last and critical page were missing. I was too late to get a refund.3. Political wokeness in their streaming support =militating against  previously mainstream culture in favor of the social, political and internationalist world view..",1
"Ordered a product which did not indicate there would be duty charges, when product was delivered $61.00 in duties had to be paid.This is misleading to the consumer, and guess this is how Amazon rips off customers.Contacted Amazon Customer support, they indicated to send the Duties invoice to cs-reply @amazon.caand after doing so, now they are indicating to contact someone else.So the round and around starts so Amazon doesn't take ownership on ripping off customers.This department ...acc-global @amazon.ca is useless and just wants to get rid of you. Basically go away and contact another department.Now I know how Amazon has so much money Ripping us off",0
The one and only reason I have Amazon Prime is for the free 2 day shipping. Why am I paying $119 a year when the average shipping time on my orders is 10+ days? Amazon should be offering Prime members a discounted rate until they get back to 2 day shipping!!,0
"Amazon has the most unknowledgeable, uncaring sustomer service I've ever seen.  Disgusting.",0
The best customer service with the exception of adobe,2
"A couple of years ago I had a problem with my Amazon membership and was able to get through right away to someone who could speak good clear English and it was taken care of in less than a minute. This time I just got a notice saying that my order of light bulbs was attempted but not left. No explanation why, no nothing. Tried calling customer service got put on hold by someone who I could not understand 3 times then the phone on their end hung up after time. Their customer service has done a 180 not for the good.",0
I was told that after giving a month of my time on the kindle challenge that I would receive a $5 kindle credit. Unfortunately they didn't tell me I had to pay the taxes. Nice one Amazon. You've done it again. Screw over everyone and hopefully you will get it back in karma.,0
"There's been a lot of wrong items sent to me lately. I've shopped at Amazon for years and recently there's more errors with the orders. I notice this is more common with high priced items being 'mistaken' for much cheaper ones. My last order was supposedly delivered to me, which was supposed to be a $60 drink mix pack, and instead I had received someone's clearly worn and returned sports bra. What's so hard about installing a camera system to have full view of all employees as they work?! I had to spend 2 hours of my Sunday trying to print a return label and drive around to the nearest actual UPS drop off location for their mistake. Now I have to wait even longer and hope they can get it right this time. Makes me feel as though I now have to video-record picking up my package at the locker in its entirety, which is ridiculous. I was reading somewhere that Amazon is instilling a lot of fear in employees and publicly shaming those who are caught stealing but I feel that simply installing more cameras and looking into discrepancies as they happen would prove more effective in getting rid of dishonest workers.",0
"Very very very bad customer service and drivers!!! Every time I order something keeps saying delivered and I don’t get it, they send me pictures of it and it be at the wrong house!! Do your job or go home!!!!",0
"Exceptional and outstanding products, delivery, customer service on par with John Lewis!!!",2
"What a complete bunch of robbing gits, as a prime customer I agreed to free trial with kindle unlimited and amazon music. Both stipulated that they would send an email to me before my subscription renewal date. I then cancelled my prime account and now find they are charging me for auto renewal of my ""free trials"" absolute disgrace never give these people your payment details as they will rip you off anyway they can. Wish there was a zero star option",0
they now take 60 days to do refunds so if you buy something from Amazon and anything goes wrong they’ll take it back and keep your money for as long as they please ie 2 months.,0
I ordered a razor off Amazon.com and within two days it was at my house. Amazing! Amazon lets you pay $80 per year and receive free two-day shipping on everything. It's really a great deal.,2
I'm on a call with Amazon now about a return and the advisor on the call has one of the best customer services telephone manners. I've experienced similar with Amazon before as well so appears like a consistent thing. Great to know they've kept their customer first tradition.,2
"Ordered a $3000 product and it showed that the product shipped. In fact the product did not ship and the price jumped up significantly $1200 to be exact. When I left a negative review about the shady transaction, Amazon pulled my review. This has been the 3rd time with a similar outcome. I purchase and item, the item does not ship, then the price goes up and still shows in stock. Amazon has become a very shady place to shop. They truly have no customer service anymore. Also if you leave a review they don't like it will not get posted. Shady! Shady! Shady! I will be looking elsewhere for my online purchases from now on.",0

"Amazon consistently amazes me with their vast selection and speedy delivery options. Their customer service is also top-notch, addressing issues promptly and courteously. A true gem in online shopping!",2
How many times do I have to be cut off until someone at Amazon answers the phone. I have tried 5 times this morning and been cut off every time. No stars from me. You do not even deserve 1 star. Rubbish service.,0
I ordered 2 sets of Cushions. Each set had 5 numbers of cushions.The delivery guy just delivered 1 set only. The stupid unfriendly app does not have any place to capture it. Inspite of putting it in product review and delivery review no one from the company is interested in resolving my concern. I rated 1 star because there is no scope to score less than that here.,0

Excellent thanks for letting,1
I had a broken xbox controller pad I had prime so I got a new one the next day payed 103  they sent me a faulty pad ...I'm waiting 30 days for a refund from this day on I'm never buying anything from amazon ever again .... they received the product it then took them 6 days to process the refund that time is absolutely disgusting to hold on to 100 pounds worth of my money for that long ..,0
the customer reviews and ratings are very useful.,2
"ordered stuff that took kinda long to arrive, and the shipping fee for an item is relatively high especially when they consider the item is 'special' with extra handling fee",1
"Had a very bad experience, bought a camera from Amazon and the flash was not compatible, I was asked to return it which i did but i lost more than 300usd, they took 100usd for restocking and i spent over 300 usd for shipping expenses.  I regretted it.",0
Love Amazon but they really need to do something about the excessive packing which is a strain on the environment. Although the cost is great and the variety and the trustworthiness of the goodss and shipment is excellent. But all that is marred when the item is tiny and it is packed in a huge box with a lot of packing plastic/cardboard materials.,1
"It’s okay, amazon is cool for gadgets though",1
I chose to get a laptop.  It was very easy and had great directions to go by.  The best part is that they said it would take 2-3 days to get and I received it the very next day.  I couldn’t believe it!,2
"I moved overseas and my phone number changed, therefore, I cannot receive 2 step authentication. I followed their steps  to disable  it and still can't get into my account because the two step verification I tried to get disabled still exists AND their email to me utterly failed to address this issue. I BLOODTY HATE AMAZON. It really isn't that hard people. Read the email and respond.",0
"Amazon have treated ( me ) their customers very badly, by unjustifiably increasing  Ring products subscription fees. I will be making a real effort in future to share the wealth, by looking to find alternative suppliers for anything previously found on Amazon.",0
You can find almost everything is Amazon,2
"Yeah, they kind of took over the world, right. They do fine. Not great or spectacular, fine.",1
"If I could leave a zero I would. I have used Amazon for years, shopping, prime, kindle and audible and one of the things I ordered this year was an iPhone 14 for my daughter’s Christmas present.  When I opened the box there was a box of biscuits inside. I got onto Amazon straight away on the chat and the guy told me not to worry that it would be sorted immediately. I took photos and made a police report but Amazon wouldn’t contact the police about the report so I had to post back the box of biscuits 😡 I am still waiting for my refund even though the biscuits have been received by them by now and they keep saying it takes up to 30 days to process the return and refund. It is Christmas week and I am supposed to have a phone for my daughter for Christmas, it’s the only thing she asked for but I won’t receive the refund in time. Amazon do not care about their customers, it’s just money, money, money with them. Well I may well be only one person but as soon as I receive my refund I will never use Amazon again and will delete my account",0
"Though ordering and paying was easy, the order part was not so fine. I ordered a book and it took almost 2 months to arrive.",1
Its really a bad service i have ordered some items should be deliver next day then it take 2 days in the third day they send me message they will deliver my order by 8 PM so im in duty expecting my order at 8 my husband waiting at home for it @ 6PM i missed a call from the driver then i tried to call him several times he blocked my number then i called customer service they said that i informed the driver cancel the order and he cancelled my order so that all on Friday 27.08.2021 so customer service keep sending me from one to one at the end one of them his name hani he promised that will deliver my order next day Saturday 28.08.2021 morning i accept then i didn't receive and still shown on there app cancelled then contact them again another agent his name is abdumunim like he dosent know and simply he said ur order cancelled he didn't even tried to check the issu then also he promised to deliver the order by today but also nothing so its a really bad service and by the way its not first time also another order the driver called me for the location i tried to explain he asked to send a location on  whats app this time i don't have internet so i told him he shout to me then he dropped the call so this my experience with amazon drivers and staff,0

excellent delivering! I got the package a day earlier than expected and it was very easy to track the package and see how far it was. I ordered from Denmark and only payed a small prize for taxes when it arrived (44 kr),2
"Prime ..I agree with other posters here and other sites. Prime is no longer the 'next day delivery' promised. In fact paying Prime is now rip off becaue deliveries are the same without paying for it. In effect its a wste of money.Prime offers other  benefits --so they say . Music .. theres a rotten selection and only there to force you into subscribing to their millions of songs library . Its cheaper and better to get Spotify and forget Amazon music altogether.  During this year the music selection has been reduced continually . Now its useless. Asking for a song gets the generic response 'Heres a  station you might find if your lucky what you are lookng for '  Generally you dont . so thats another waste of time.Linking Spotify to the Echo account used to be easy . Now they make it difficult to force you into the poor Amazon Music.Amazon Prime Videos . another free benefit!!!   It offers nothing more than a few old movies . Far better is available elsewhere. Netfilx is FAR superior and at the same subcription price . Amazon is no competitor.Finally the Echo units 'age' and become deaf. I have 4 ... YES FOUR , in different continents and they all suffer from the same deafness problem. In my opinion its an inbuilt planned problem designed to make you buy another later version.  Dirty business practice.I wouldnt buy another echo..ever. I recommend you dont either.Nor would I subscribe to Prime. tyhose who have already done so would be well advised to review any benefit . They like me and others will conclude theres no value and cancel for refund",0
I wish I could make it zero stars these guys are complete fools! And a customer service people are from some other goddamn country that doesn't give a crap about anything and they won't let you talk to a supervisor they sent it to the wrong house twice! They send me a picture of a red house and I live in a white house and these fools can't figure this out! I tried to get my stuff delivered by UPS and they won't do it! I flagged down a Amazon van and they told me they're hiring temporary fools that don't know what they're doing so here's my advice buy your stuff from anybody but Amazon,0
I am beyond disgusted with Amazon. For months now they have been taking money from my account for a prime account I do not have. I have tried multiple times to call amazon up and it is a wrong number. Ince the numerous emails I was sending were answered and then the next email I received was to say they are not replying to email due to Covid! This is the third time this year I have been charged for services I am not using with. First it was being charged for two amazon prime accounts when I only had one... since cancelling they are charging me for one account even though I am not a member. Audible- (amazon company) was also charging me for an account I didn’t have. The fact that it is near impossible to get in touch with them makes the whole experience incredibly distressing. They are thieves.,0
"Lately it seems that your search will reveal many items but are apparently from the same manufacturer. There will be the XYZ company or the Lovemore company or what ever the name is but when you look at each item by different companies they are all the same sales page. Its like there is an uncle who produces the item and six kids and cousins who create a company and sell the items. Sometimes the prices are different or the ship time but its still the same item. Problem is it wastes your shopping time. Also, MANY of these companies have quality issues. Amazon needs to pare down these duplicate search results.",1

This is a decent app to buy stuff from but I order something and it said it would come today but it never came.,1
I buy almost everything except food and large items from Amazon. Always excellent service and deliveries are faultless. If I ever have an issue I use live chat and my problems are always quickly sorted. Highly recommended company.,2
"I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.",1
Never ordering from amazon again...they've had £200 out me only for me not to receive any orders...if you know its not in stock you shouldn't take our money...its a giant scam...now I've to wait to get my money back...but you didn't wait to take it... its Never having my custom again...SCAMMERS,0
While the convenience of having things shipped to the house in a two day span for free(Prime--on some items) (a lot of disclaimers here) but when they are obviously trying to compete and raise prices on things you can get cheaper else where. Eh. I'd rather go to the store and get it then wait 2 days and pay more. The appeal isnt there anymore when youre not pricing competitively. Oh and the few times ive had issues they customer assistance treats you like a criminal/scam artist so yeah. Eh. I do it if its easier or cheaper but not my go to.,1
Dispence with companies who make misleading copy content....ie STRETTON PAYNE GUITARS.THE POINT IS THEY MAKE YOU LOOK CHUMPS...AS YOU ARE THE SHOP WINDOW.,1
why life is fine at amazon?,1
"They have reliable drivers masked by rude, and drivers that totally dis respect me as a customer. Throwing parcels over or by back gate saying handed to me in person. Yesterday had message saying parcel delivered to my safe place. Not there. Told to knock at doors to find it.",1
Excellent service and prompt delivery. Secure packing.,2
"Amazon have really messed me about, not one order in the last month has gone smoothly. But they have put things right everytime. Just wished I didn't have to keep making complaints. However Amazon Prime is great and the Fire Stick is amazing. So come on Amazon sort the order process out so we can have a fine assistance.",1
I really do love Amazon!,2
Their chat customer support is absolutely rubbish. They want you to keep typing the same thing over and over. I gave up in the end.,1
"I tried to log in 3 times in a row, each time entering the same password, each time it was ‚wrong’ and i had to change it (to an equal one) and again wrong password. moreover, I can’t find the option ‚personal document settings’ anywhere. it seems like amazon doesn’t want to let people buy books on other websides than itself. i am really dissapointed, the side should help people but all it does is to confuse.",0
Zero accountability  they block you. I've been a client for almost eleven years  but I think I'm gonna leaving them. Unskilled customer service operators; their answers are useless and they are also rufe and unpolite,0
"For me the advantages favour me to shop here but the place is far from perfect. The customer assistance, when an issue arises is low rate. You will be speaking to staff from India and they have know idea how to address a normal conversation which makes the entire interaction an absolute waste of time. Away from that most of it is beneficial. Being in the City Centre Amazon performs well. Although the live tracking sucks. In 2022 you know customer assistance is almost non existence and everything is heading in a way to become less interactive with humans. But it’s probably the better assistance compared to the rest that’s out there. It’s classic consumerism consuming us. Spend with care, it will always get worst not better.",1

Amazon has stopped 2 day shipment in my area. Ridiculous why even get prime at this point?,1

Amazon has its fine points, but overall it really lost its ""Touch""....don't get me started with Amazon Prime Shopping support....it started out strong....but now....it is just plain crap!!!! Expired, rotten, thawed, broken, and open items...are just the norm now....sad! I do not see a benefit Paying for Prime anymore....",1

I've got a burst tyre so needed an air compressor to see if i can crawl to a garage for a new tyre. Took three days to arrive. Tracked them online. Guy big grin on his face when i said there tracking was good. Made a comment on notice i put on front door for friend in case i was not in. Delivery man wears bright fluorescent  yellow. Makes a trite comment and still grinning walks away. Now i have to see if i can repair car.     ,0
"I have used amazon for several years. My wife has opened a account with them. She ordered a watch from amazon for delivery to me. When it arrived there was no watch in the box. I  returned the watch to amazon. Amazon agreed to a refund, but never got the refund. Amazon now say there was no watch in the box when I returned the watch. I my wife and most of my friends will nolonger use a company like this.Would like to hear from anyone who has had the same problem.",0
"The ordering interaction is always fine, but don't try and call customer assistance. The people are very hard to understand, theres so much noise in the background you cant hear anything and they put you through hoops to check on your own damn account. ITS RIDICULOUS!!",1
Lifetime customer in the making!I've been an Amazon customer over 10 years. I take full advantage of the Prime program. I've rarely received service that was below expectations and they frequently score well above expectations. They've taken care of me on multiple occasions and offer amazing service to cost performance.,2
I order a Xmas tree with Amazon prime to be delivered in a  nominated day as prime gives you this option. The tree never came and all day i had to sit and wait while from miday was saying out for delivery. After I call costumer service to find out what is happening now they said is gonna be delivered today and they can't really provide me with a time frame of the delivery. So I guess I have to get off again to wait for a mistake that it isn't mine and cause is very easy to take off days whenever you need.Find a solution Amazon. Call the courier company and solve your mistake. This is what is called costumer service. I don't want someone to listen what happened I 2ant someone to deal with it and fix it.Never never never again,0
I've had many  Packages stolen  because  they  continue  to leave  my stuff  out back 4 my 76 year  old mom  to have  to walk  around  entire home to get!!! You can see pictures  of my delivery instructions on my Google  n or fb. Blessed  day  y'all...CLnChico2,0
"I have to give a star there is no option not to give a star.Do Not Sign Up for a Amazon Credit card Dispite the so called rewards You Will be Scammed and pay for things you have not ordered or bought. There Answer is to call the company in Question even when you had not purchased anything from the company. Due to the lack of intrest I cancelled my card. Unfortunatley I requested a refund for a item bought on a Amazon card which I had cancelled. So we reinvented the wheel again, Amazon card company would not pass me through there security check, so back to Amazon, who said they would put me through to the Amazon card company, So basically you are stuffed in a loop now one will give you a phone number or arrange for someone to call you back. So steer clear of this card for your own health and wallet. if you want my contact details I am not shy I dont know the rules but its stourbridge kev on facebook.",0
"My daughter has a Amazon account and she’s living in Bothell, Washington. I live in Chisholm, Mn. She ordered gifts for my granddaughter from me and I had her use my debit card to purchase them. Amazon charged my account a membership fee! I am unable to use that membership, because I don’t have an account! WOW. I have called several times trying to get a refund and they keep telling me I have an account, but I had canceled my membership last summer because they kept double charging my account. After I canceled, they continued charging the membership fees. I finally had to have my bank block them completely. They have totally gone down the tubes! Also, when I canceled I forgot I had a 20 dollar credit in the account. I called last night to try to have them credit it back to my bank and the customer service said they could credit my card and asked if they should proceed. I wasn’t even allowed time to respond when I got a message they had gone ahead!! The card on file wasn’t accurate anymore. He then passed me off to another rep and that one passed me off to another rep! The final rep was a phone call and I kept getting a fax number sort of sound every couple of words. Now when I think about it, I feel like it may have been some sort of scam call? I really used to love Amazon, now I absolutely despise that place. What a shame.",0
"I cant understand why there are so many low scores for Amazon. Where else can you go and get same day delivery, on Prime and the items and packaging come in perfect condition. Such a range and always giving price comparisons. I know I can rely on them to deliver on time with no hastle. I can return items with no questions if I or they got it wrong. Its easier and cheaper than going to town for sure with more variety. I'm very pleased. this is not a one off experience, i have been shopping with them for years with many purchases.",2
Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty fine but they really do need to sort out their third party shipment  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1

"Their e-book reader, the Kindle has a very extensive library of titles to choose from. Amazon's customer service is fantastic - they replaced my kindle free of charge.",2
"Terrible,  actually got some new work jeans on prime delivery for a special event for work and they haven't turned up, apparently there going to be 3/4 days late, what a joke",0
There was a promised delivery date when I ordered. After order suddenly the delivery date was unknown but still they send me an invoice and expecte me to pay for it before I received the goods. And the support told me the stock is not updated in real time. That is absolutely ridiculous to have a system you can't trust for items in stock.,0
Amazon is great. You get almost everything there and they have very good service to offer.,2
"Amazon actually supports killing of babies, innocent men, women and children, can’t believe i actually use to shop on Amazon, I am disgusted.",0
"Only thing so far that I don't  like about Amazon is that they usually do not deliver packages to my home. I have to go to the Post Office, which is about 15, 20, minutes from my house. ",1
"****Latest entry*****So as my previous review went I have been happily shopping with Amazon since 2005 and the customer support has been exemplary.So what the hell happened, back to back to back issues, generic responses, can only us their crap chat or 'call you' which never calls me!Shambolic, gradually weaning myself off Amazon and shopping elsewhere.What went wrong!?!*****Original post*****It is quite hard to review a certain aspect of Amazon as they provide so many assistances, of which I subscribe to being a Prime customer, premium Amazon music and own numerous echo and fire devices. And failure in one part of their assistance will result in ordinary feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past usages with Amazon and it's customer assistances which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can usage with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a decent job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime order is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a decent word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a ordinary review than a decent one, as we expect the assistance to be decent from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the ordinary reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!",1
Overall it was a good experience but their customer service seriously needs improvement.,2
"I’ve been using amazon prime for let me guess lol I think like 5 year now never had a problem with them I enjoy the free two day shipping it’s amazing, & the fact that they actually take a picture and post it to your account showing that they left it by the door is straight peace of mind... so then you just know your neighbor stole it lol but your are for sure they delivered it. I’ve only had one wrong order and the seller immediately fixed it gotta appreciate great, fast & now somewhat more secure delivery 🚚 my husband hates them because I order just to much it’s a bit obsessive you can find any and everything from dishware to cute boots🥰🔥",2
"XPO Logistics is the worst company ever. I ordered a play house for my granddaughters on Amazon . XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the shipment provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the item somewhere else. I am not ordering anymore large items from Amazon if they are going to keep using this company. XPO Logistics  has horrible customer assistance!!!! Amazon has not done anything about this organization that they paired up with.",1
"In general i think their deliveries are a little slow and although they are cheap , they're not the cheapest. But for reliablity and overall quality of service you can beat them.",2
"Got to say i love Amazon. No more going to town, paying for parking, speaking to useless staff in shop. Waiting weeks for delivery.£80 a year for next day delivery to my desk along with a TV subscription is great value.Never disappointed with Amazon, high street let me down time and again.",2
"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years. It used to be great and I loved it, I still do but there are more and more disappointments with almost every other order, it is going down the hill: it is already a norm for the packages to get lost, not to arrive on time, customer support is usually useless and not professional. I used to do most of my shopping through Amazon but I am trying to avoid ordering on Amazon now, I hope they will get it under control.",1
I placed a LARGE order through amazon and many items were considered undeliverable to the address and were returned by USPS. However that was on the 23rd of JUNE! I am now in JULY and still no refund has come across. I spoke with AMAZON and no person will give me a refund for the items I did not receive. It is crazy that they have no problem taking your 1k amount for the items you ordered but when it comes to getting a refund for the undeliverable items they will not give it. THANK YOU FOR STEALING MY MONEY AMAZON!,0
Awful customer service. We ordered 2 smart watches costing £480 and received disney against humanity card game costing £17 in their place. We were asked to return the card game which we did expecting a refund for the items we did not receive. We have now been told we will not receive a refund until January 2024. These items were supposed be christmas presents. Very disappointed 😞,0

I like this platform . It’s easy to use and it keeps you updated . The problem sometimes comes from order . Some order persons don’t follow instructions and leave packages unintended on the floor were all passbyers can take package and steal it . It started to happen more often .,1
AMAZON I DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR GAY PRIDE CELEBRATION SO DO NOT SEND ME ONE MORE GAY PRIDE NOTICE!!! ONE MORE AND IM DONE WITH YOU.,0
"Shopping online used to scare me a lot. However since I've found Amazon I'm not scared anymore. They are the biggest online shopping portal ,the friendliest and the most easy to use. I use Amazon almost every week and their speed delivery option is simply fantastic.  I once had a problem with my product and contacted the customer service department and was greeted by a customer service rep in less than 10 minutes. They solved my problem and was offered a brand new product which was delivered in a few days.",2
Fees are high sellers and no support..unable to get anyone on line from seller support..extremely frustrating.,0
"one of the best online book stores.. i was looking for a book for my project work,i was recommended to amazon and i got the book there and i am satisfied with how they work.",2
Terrible customer service. Website has some sort of glitch and changed my address after purchase to a address that I haven’t used in 3 years. They couldn’t replace my order or change my shipping address or help me in anyway. All they could do is cancel my order for me. Told me that I messed up and was the reason for the wrong address being selected.,0
"Goods always delivered quickly and as described. Comminication is excellent. On the one problem I had with a faulty camera when it was still in warranty, they replaced it immediately.",2
I am not only disgusted that you charge what you do for Prime and half the time items take twice the promised time or more.I am also so disgusted with the political stance of this company and its monopoly.I am closing my account and will NEVER order from Amazon again!!!,0
If you use the platform properly you can avoid 9 out of the 10 problems people are talking about. Watch your sellers and READ about shipping,2
"The Amazon shipping practice is ridiculus.  If you purchase enough to receive free shipping without a Prime membership, they wait a week or more to actually ship the items.  This has been the consistent experience.  It is very frustrating.  I try to find a marketplace seller or check Walmart for free 2 day shipping.  Not at all satisfied with my experiences.",0
"Amazing customer service. Not all the products they sell are quality, but they have always taken, within a reasonable amount of time, my returns if I wasn’t satisfied.",2
"I try to buy a book on my kindle and bam, account suspended, provide details. This is my 4 or 5 account. Such a**holes. I made sure to use different cards for these accounts but yet to Amazon it seems goddamn suspicious, that u want to buy a book on your goddamn kindle. I am just speechless. All these problems started when i bought their kindle and now i just regret it… worst support experience unless u call directly in the US",0
"I had an overall acceptable interaction with this website, but their customer support team made me rate like this my interaction.",1
"Sometimes Amazon customers care is so funny because it a big joke. Whats funnier is the amazon fulfillment service. Sometimes the contact with them kind of rub off on you and you're going to be so much funnier. A CLOWN! There's so much trust that when you return a product and the courier service tells you that they don't accept returns and you'll loose the courier charge and you still want the return so you call an associate they ask you to send the details and tracking id and everything will be fine and you pay the courier charge which they promise, will be returned along with the refund- Chapter I CLOWN IOI ! Then,just like the courier service said,they does not accept the product and blame the courier service. you'll think the courier service is a joke but no baby!You are! -Chapter 2 CLOWN IOI They say the courier service wouldn't have delivery in the area,and when they checked into the courier service, it was shown that the adress,which is of an amazon shipment shown that the adress,which is ot an amazon shipment center,was incorrect,Which you may be dumb enough to believe (jokes on you actually), then the courier service calls you to say that they have attempted delivery (and you realize almost every major courier service would be having delivery near an amazon shipment hub) and says that they are not accepting the return and if the product should be sent back.You call the associate they ask you to sent the details and then try again and promise they ask you to sent the details and then try again and promise you everything will be fixed this time. Voila! -Chapter 3 CLOWN 101. You sent it again. They reject it again . They ask you to take back the product. Then try the return again and loose twice the money. IDK what you think man but this class is fire! I don't think its the iey. IDK what you think man but this class is fire! I don't think its the joker hype but yeah. This is jocker,but you're the the funny one! 🤡PS - The barcode or details was not tampered because the second time is asked the courier service to retry after sticking the printing labels amazon sent me, just in case if the barcode was tampered or something.",0
"Amazon has become such a greedy corporation using bait and switch delivery times so you order and then they change the delivery. I ordered something on prime which said next day delivery and it wasn't even shipped next day and took 5 days to receive.Jeff Bezos and Amazon are unethical and have no loyalty except to money & greed. Amazon platform was designed as a, ""online retail outlet"" for businesses and people to sell on.It wasn't enough to put many mom & pop stores out of business, their greed took over and they turned their backs on the very same people that built their business, the sellers.Once Amazon analyzed sales reports and repeat sales they decided to screw the seller and began to sell their own branded products like batteries etc.They used the US Postal Service, FEDEX and UPS until they decided to operate delivery services.They place their ""ads"" prominently when you search for a product, giving them a greedy, unfair advantage.If that wasn't enough their Prime Services have gotten more expensive and they pushed back their delivery guarantees.Prime has increased, Amazon Music has increased, Audible has increased and NOW, after paying for an inferior ""Prime"" product that continues to decline, they decided to put ads on Prime Video and if you want ""ad free"" it is an additional $2.99 per month.Amazon Prime is inferior to Netflix as I have no issues streaming on Netflix or other Apps on tv, but Amazon constantly has lag issues and connection issues and doesn't respond.I have already been trimming my Amazon reliance, left Amazon Music, left Audible, using Amazon much less and can't wait to pull the plug on Amazon completely.I heard FEDEX is now going to compete with Amazon and in Fall of 2024 they are supposed to be launching their own online selling platform!! I can't wait!!",0
"To all,We have been Amazon clients for a very long time.We have just ordered an iPhone XV for our daughter...when we received the package, we gave the Amazon code to the delivery guy. The package was sealed with tape. When we opened it their was a Dove lotion bottle - clearly the same weight and size of the iPhone.We called right away the customer service but Amazon said that the package was delivered. They were not nice at all and after 5' of conversation did not seem to care. We had to send photos and we are awaiting their answer within 3 days. This is theft. It can only have taken place in their warehouse or while it was delivered but...someone somewhere must have known what was in the package - which means access to Personal Data! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.NEW SCAM - DO NOT ORDER iPHONE or anything expensive - Warehouse or delivery THEFT!",0
"I wish I could give Amazon 5 stars, but I have had some very frustrating customer support interactions with them recently. I recently bought a remote control and I ended up with a used remote that someone must have returned. I bought it through Amazon directly and not even a third-party seller. I learned my lesson there. I then had to talk to customer support and the person I spoke with did not really understand what I was even talking about. It was incredibly frustrating. Amazon has great prices and they ship fast, but they are a massive company that just doesn't get it right all of the time.",1
I never got my stuff can't get up with anyone to help me.this will be the last time I will buy anything on line they got my money but I don't have my stuff,0
"oh please. WHY is amazon all of a sudden NOT allowing me to login, but sending me to my webmail in order to  confirm it's me logging in? what a  big bother for nothing!  this is happening every single day  for several days now. The dumb FOREIGN customer service has NO  answers. They a re also taking the brunt of my anger. And threatening me since i used some cuss words about amazon. Much deserved! So, they say this: ""Someone is attempting to sign-in to your account.WhenOct xx, 2020 xxxx PMDeviceMozilla Firefox for Windows (XXXXX)NearSame as current IP address (xxxxxxxx) ""the email says: ""Someone is attempting to sign-in to your account.When: 	Oct xx, 2020 xxxx PM Pacific Daylight TimeDevice: 	Mozilla Firefox Windows (xxxx)Near: 	xxxxxxx, United StatesPlease approve or deny."" LOL, RIDICULOUS AND SUCH A HUGE WASTE OF MY TIME AND ENERGY, AND GETS ME SO INFURIATED! do they really want extremely angry customers? .....yeah really, Amazon? IT'S ME TRYING TO SIGN IN SO I CAN SPEND MONEY ON YOUR SITE! i guess that's not ok with you? who the h3ll do youthink you are , a BANK? there is no reason for this. I haven't changed anything. THEY have apparently bought into some dimwit's version of website security! There is def such a thing as overdoing it,  and guess what, YOU SEND PEOPLE AWAY FROM YOUR WEBSITE, AND MAKE THEM  INFURIATED, THEY WILL LIKELY NOT COME BACK . They will likely boycott you , or worse, sue you or some kind of mass  consumer action..  And i spend thousands there.  HOW  BRAINLESS AND SENSELESS COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE!NOV. 14- update----- still doing this to me after all my complaints, and it's a month later. EVERY day  first time i log in, and sometimes twice a day, THAT'S CRAZY.======================== AMAZON  WRONGFULLY BILLING EBT FOODSTAMP ITEMS TO CASH OR CREDIT.Recently Amazon  started accepting EBT snap foodstamps for Fresh  grocery orders. BUT THEY WOULD ONLY CHARGE SOME OF THE FOOD TO EBT, when the program  states they have to charge ebt for food items.  They instead charged to the other payment method,  such as bank acct or credit card! That's not allowed by the Snap program. It's a government program and correct processing of payment has to be obeyed . After a few times, i noticed they  corrected this, for the most part- but not entirely. This must have cost some poor people having overdraft on thier tiny bank account with only 3 bucks left in it. Because some of my own  erroneously charged items would cost 20+ bucks. Probably theirs too. Well i think numerous people would have complained , i know some did, complain to t he government. I think AMZN got thier proverbial butt swatted. As they did clean it up as i said, FOR THE MOST PART. now they seem to be almost always billing the food items to ebt snap LIKE THEY SHOULD.But for me it cost me several hours of filing payment disputes to my  credit card co, to get the charges reversed and put back onto ebt electronic benefit transfer card.  HUGE HEADACHE.================================Amazon recently also DELETED ALL MY  HUNDREDS OF COMMENTS AND REVIEWS, FOR SOME PERSONAL PRIVATE  UNKNOWN REASON of some admin. I put in hundreds of hours on those, and had a high ranking for  my reviews. they were read  over 50,000 times. They gave me NO reason except some bogus thing about "" we repeatedly warned you about violating our rules"" but of course, NOT REALLY ! they  didn't warn me at all. As if there was anything to warn about! someone simply was on the other side of a current affairs issue, and  had a personal bone to pick. that's all i can figure. Did this p*ss me off at all? oh, you better believe it!  am i powerless though? NOPE. far from it. i think Amazon site has been handed over to inferior management, who are now ruining the site and abusing customers who have spent thousands on their site. this is going to  backfire  massively. .===============================Once upon a time, i think amazon used to have a feedback  feature where you could tell t hem what you think about thier site. This was so essential! now they don't have it, but so many  problems and  stress are happening to customers- it's a huge mistake to remove that! it makes anger build into  a real head of steam. There's no   effective outlet! They aren't listening! People will feel like punishing any stupid company doing that.The owner Bezos, is getting so dang rich,  richest guy  on earth. Well right there, you know he isn't putting the money we pay,into proper  service and proper  management of the site and the commerce.BEZOS IS CUTTING CORNERS AND CHEAPING OUT ON ESSENTIAL BUSINESS PRACTICES, SITE MGMT, AND ALLOWING BAD TREATMENT OF CUSTOMERS, IN ORDER TO GET EVEN FILTHIER RICH.",0
"My order was supposed to arrive by 5/2. Changed to 5/6. Never arrived. Did not allow me to ask for replacement until 5/9.When I asked for replacement, I chat with Amazon customer service for over 30 minutes, I was told that is not an option. Told me to reorder something different. Promise to give me credit for the shipping cost of the reorder as shipping was free on my original order. Did not see any credit in my account.",0
"Good support, with fast order, however they сheet us, if you have an Amazon prime they said order is free, but one time I checked same item from Amazon account of my friend with no Prime and them I decided to place order from my Amazon account with Prime, and the price with free order was same as in regular account + order cost.",1

"Good evening, Happy Monday!!I just got done talking to Pat Y. I wanted to informed you that he is an EXCELLENT customer service to work with (10 stars). He was so polite and nice. He went above and beyond and was very professional. He definitely knows his job/business. If I could, I would  continue to use him for any online inquiries. His answer were clear and where necessary detailed enough for us to make informed decisions quickly about purchasing another pair of shoes.Great hire manager. He definitely deserve a raise.",2
"Absolute disgrace of a company.Biggest pile of frauds I have ever came acrossThey provide no support for thier third party sellers whatsoever, and then brag on about how they give small business the opportunity to sell on the worlds biggest platform, they just screw you, as long as they are covered.",0
Has been consistently efficient and I have been using them for years. Amazon almost always has the lowest prices too!,2
"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
Everything I want I order from Amazon But there delivery and tracking is starting to leave a nasty taste in my mouth. Several orders have been late when I needed them I get emails out for delivery the 9 stop away then 11p m no order 2 am your orders delayed how?if it's 9 stops away this has happened on several occasionsTracking is never up to date What's going on Amazon?,0
"Been using Amazon on and off for a few years now, never had any issues that is until this last order I made. I placed the order and 12 hours later get a response in my email saying my order was cancelled due to insufficient funds thing is funds were not insufficient and the order came in anyways. Normally if something is insufficient it tells me rite away not 12 hours later in a email. Amazon need's to update their order processing and payment sytem. The reason I give three stars is because it's the only issue I've had with Amazon and if this continues to be the same usage I will be giving the lowest rating but as for a second chance I'm sticking to three stars.",1
"Love everything Amazon, sure there has been the odd hiccup here and there with an item but deliveries are fast and always when they should be. Generally speaking anything ordered for Prime delivery is of good quality and rarely have an issue with a prime item. Amazon have really seen the niche in the market to get stuff to customers when they need it and the range over all is massive.",2
"It took 2 days from clicking ""order"" to recieving my item.From US to Europe that is ! Unfortunately the item had a defect and after a very brief customer support Amazon sent me a replacement - free of charge.No return of the original product required.",2
"I think Amazon is losing its control of deliveries. I am a Prime member and Amazon customer for over 10 years. This is the second time they tell me my package is probably lost. The first was a couple of months ago, a cordless vacuum I had to cancel the order after 10 days of no arrival. Now, I keep waiting for another order that has been tracked all the way to my local area. Its been four days and it now says that ""the package may be lost"". They have been very good in the past but I cant hide my disappointment when this happens. COMON, AMAZON..GET A GRIP!!! ",2
Ehhh its great and all but they gotta give more opportunities to peepple to make money,2
"Horrible outsourced customer service. Why would they care about your problems when the are in a different hemisphere, a different culture, and completely different ethics.  Sure let's move customer support to India the rape capital of the world. That will show how inclusive we are. Spent numerous calls and hours trying to resolve order issues and them randomly wiping my account.  Customer support is never helpful with a thick language barrier without any US Based support options. Paying for prime was meant to result in two days delivery but here I am waiting a week for items on the prime list. The only way to win at all in this capitalist culture is to boycott and refuse all transactions ",0
"I cannot get enough: subscribe and save, next day service, and lots of add ons.",2
"I recently gave Amazon a bad review, it was somewhat reluctant. I had an adverse purchase through Wholesale Hunter, a dreadful company by the way. What is to.be learned is if a purchase is not directly from Amazon, a third party seller situation. We the buyer should practice caution, if anything does not seem square with that third party seller, then keep looking. Sometimes a stinker sneaks through, so beware. Amazon's strongest asset is their employees, like many companies. All the customer service people I dealt with recently did a great job overall, Amazon is beyond lucky to have them. I also wish for healing for the employees lost in the recent storm/warehouse, and their families.",2
always found what i had been looking for,2
"Amazon delivery is getting worse even though I give a safe place it is left on doorstep and we both at work till 6 very unprofessional now , the other day a projector was left good job I am honest I could have said many times I never recived  my items  ...  not a happy customer",0
"What Amazon has done to me and my grandson is disgusting. My grandson asked me for something for Christmas. I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it. Being 65 it's better I buy online then visit stores during Covid19. I received emails from Amazon 1.) on Dec 1st, order confirmation. 2.) on Dec 7th, my item has shipped and I should expect it by Dec 8th. After a few days waiting for item to arrive I started contacting Amazon. From one customer service (CS) rep to another rep, then supposedly one cs team leader to another cs team leader, I got the same answer they don't know what happened to my grandson's Christmas gift. They kept telling me that they can no longer give me my item I payed for and was told I would receive it proof of emails received by Amazon. I tried all over the web to find Amazon's Executive contact information. I called the executive office's where they would not give me any executive to talk to about my problem. I sent emails to a few executives but no answer as of yet, jeff at amazon being one of them. The only thing I can see is that when I purchased my item on Dec 1st it was selling for $129.99, now it up to $400.00. They must have seized my item to make more money selling it to someone else. How much more money does Jeff Bezos and Amazon want to make? So beware when Amazon screws you no one will help you.",0
Deliveries are amazingly extremely slow. I live 5 minutes from there location in my town and yet I have to wait all day long for a package and most of the time it’s delivered to the wrong address.

I have cctv so know when the driver lies .Prime is not really worth it as a lot of the films are just really cheap budgeted movies you wouldn’t watch anyway . After the last email threatening to close a very active account I am thinking now to take the lead and pull the plug on Amazon.Once they were excellent but I think they have now grown to big and offer very poor value for money",1

I have absolutely loved Amazon in the past but the last couple of months they have really disappointed me. I’m a Prime subscriber and have normally received my purchases in several days. Perfect!

i have bought some stuff worth over 200+ and when it got delivered nothing came to my door.When i contacted them they said that my item was delivered and that am trying to scam them.This was ridiculous because i have proof that nothing came to my house as well as  i saw the deliver driver running around my area for the past 2 hours this was ridiculous don't buy big stuff from amazon.They also send some false information to me as well,0
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their support, their items and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer support representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
"Happy with the purchase I made but I don't like the offer and stuff of amazon prime, i don't like the idea.",1
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the goodss supplied. It's Amazons own order support that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1
Looks acceptable but to be honest pretty terrible. The order time is terrible and the price is way too expensive. Ebay is way better. ,1
"When I leave honest review of bad product it's denied until I offer positive feedback. So, if consumer can't post honest review then major problems with this company. Starting with their business practices.",0
2 times lost my package less than a month and they don't care.....AMAZON NEVER AGAIN !!!EBAY has better and faster shipping  !!!!,0
Bought some CD's from Amazon. Three out of the five the cases were shatered. Spoke to custom services and they seemed to think that the cases didnt matter and if the CD's plaid then it was ok. Got them swapped eventually but it wasnt easy to do.,0
I have had only one issue in almost 15 years of using Amazon and find it a place to find everything and anything. When I have returned items I have no problems at all.,2
"I would like to say Amazon is terrible. It's business practices and treatment of employees are both questionable at best. It's ridiculous how little tax they pay. But they do their job very well. They make shopping easy. Their customer service is good enough. Refunds are usually straightforward.I'd love to hate Amazon, but I can't fault their execution.",2
"I am getting frustrated , I make purchases through Amazon for convenience and based on shipment times & dates and I do not think that Amazon sellers nor Amazon as a retail venue should advertise they can deliver ""same day"" , ""next day"" or even ""Prime shipment"" when they CANNOT fulfill the transaction according to the terms when the item(s) were ordered . This happens more times than not , it's aggravating and that is the point of this review !",1
"Love all the products you offer, your prices,that you can use points to purchase and get free delivery which is speedy.",2

"Awaiting deliveries today got my time slot of 12-2pm Amazon van came and parked outside. No one came to the door. Thought must be trying to find my parcels. Next thing drives off and my orders are updated with ""attempt made to deliver"" and will re-schedule for next day. Checked my Ring Doorbell cam and driver never got out of his van and drove off. Was an Amazon marked van too not one of their delivery agents. Amazon need to get there house in order they cant keep treating customers like this.",0
"I ordered an external battery, airtags, and waterproof airtag covers. Some of the items were missing, and others arrived damaged beyond repair because the Amazon box had no packing around the individual items, and the weight of each item crushed other items and caused the tape to break on the Amazon box, allowing some of the items to fall out. I have contacted Amazon three times and spent over 3 hours on the phone, only to be hung up on. I have contacted them by chat 15 times with no help. One person finally said I would receive a refund but had lied. They told me to return the items through UPS, but UPS will not take the package because the items contain lithium and are dangerous to ship through the mail. I was then told to get a police report, but the police wouldn't write a report when the package was not stolen, and it was Amazon's fault for not packing the box properly. The items cost me $179.25, and I cannot get a refund, and Amazon refuses to help. They just reply with automated responses to return the items or get a police report. Still, I cannot do either because of the circumstances they caused by not packing the items properly for shipping. Buyer beware! Do not order expensive tech through Amazon because you cannot trust that they will be adequately packaged, and if they arrive damaged, Amazon will not issue a refund. I'm left with dangerous, useless items that I cannot dispose of.",0
I ordered an action camera from Amazon on Wednesday. It said One day delivery. I needed in one day or at worst two days as I purchased it to take on my honeymoon to Hawaii. It made it from TN to my state of NC overnight and showed out for delivery the next morning. I then get a message that my delivery is delayed and it will be Friday or Saturday before my package arrives. I leave Saturday morning at 7am for my honeymoon. As it stands it’s Friday night and it hasn’t showed up. I am now forced to cancel my order. I called customer support and filed a complaint. I cancelled my Prime membership (as it is obviously useless) and I will be closing my Amazon Prime Visa. For a company as big as Amazon this is unacceptable.,0
Prime is not what it used to be! Tell you one date and it’s out for delivery then they reschedule for 5 days later. poor service. You speak to a bot it says it won’t be delivered till January and then gives you two options refund or you’re ok with it. Great!,0
Amazon.com carries my wife's beauty supplies...Bioelements..which are hard to find.They are more expensive than on ....rhymes with hay...but they will be here promptly and will be as advertised!!!,2
"Amazon Prime started out on a decent foot but the business continuity for order is NON-EXISTENT!  Almost every order (although thru prime) does NOT arrive at the time promise.  I pay for and use prime because it USED to have a speedy order.  I could wait almost to the 11th hour to order and get my items timely, THAT is a thing of the past!  I ordered $200 in items for an upcoming vacation and as I write this...it is 4 days until my vacation but my packages states that it is running late. The order times and dates perpetually change.  This is baffling to me because I made sure that ALL of my items was on Prime order so that I could get them before my vacation. I am NOT calling customer support again because I found out by an Amazon worker that they are only reading your order details from the same platform that we see our order.  So they are absolutely useless.  In compensation, they had out a measley $5 credit.  WTH is $5 on a $200 order???  It would be helpful for them to actually track the package up to calling the truck OR driver that has the package.  But I get the feeling that even if they did that, they would would be on the phone with the drivers ALL day, FURTHER delaying our items.  I want to cancel my membership and stop paying for Prime because an 70% of my deliveries are not PRIME!  This is just ridiculous!",1
If I could give a negative 5star I would worst customer service I've ever spoken with. Yes I know most are over seas now but I can normal deal with them and understand what they are saying. Amazon's customer service representative are the worst. Couldn't understand 3/4 of what they were trying to say. And when. I could they kept transferring me. And asking the same identical questions which weren't hard to answer. I was transferred to a specialist of absolutely nothing because he asked the same questions as the Normal representative. And gave the same answer. Saying they could reship my item and never did. Said they had to transfer me. By far the worst customer service EVER. JEFF BEZOS KEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES SHAME  ON YOU!!!!!,0
I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a item. Dont appreciate the attitude.,1
Amazon prime does not live up to the word prime.  Unless I have it delivered to a hub center it's a guessing game to when I  will receive it or where I will find my order.  I wait all day for a delivery and it either comes the next day or not at all and I have to  reorder it.  They also left a $500.00 Bose radio on the front porch of my apartment building. I wish we could go back to buying merchandise from a brick and mortar store.,0
The things I find on amazon always seem expensive to me,1
"I usually order from Amazon stuff with acceptable prices.. A few times it seems lately they would mess up my order, the first time oik it was fine but than the second time I am thinking what is going on... I called customer assistance and they told me there having problem with my address. I am thinking well you never had any other issues before. They did not give me a straight answer as to why.",1
I'm very disappointed because you do not have the same items on all your websited. Why do you have a item on .com website and not on .be website? ,1
"Everytime i use amazon, they provide lightning fast service, from a 3 day delivery (using standard!), to a refund on a year old product. They just dont have any mercy for giving you a great experience. Easy to find what you want, tells you where its coming from, even gives you cheaper options of that product from other merchants. They have a lot of stuff too. Love you guys.",2
Fuuuuck YOU AMAZON FOR LOCKING MY ACCOUNT FOR NO REASON. I BUY SOMETHING AND YOU LOCK IT? WTtttF KINDA SHiiiiiIT ARE YOU RUNNING???? NEVER WILL I USE YOUR SERVICE AGAIN,0
I ordered a bike part called last Monday they said 3 days in business days you would get your money back now it's been a week I called them and they won't help me with my item to get my refund so customer service sucks so bad I'm mad,0

"I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program. I had the EXACT book as the website (Same ISB #, same edition, etc.), and they sent it back to me saying it wasn't the right book. A little upset with the whole usage, but I still like Amazon overall.",1

Good for the most part but customer support can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon item or 3rd party seller,1
Very fast shipping!,2
Honestly sent tv back in Jan taken till march get refund amazon your customer service is awfull . And I'm will never order again,0
"I ordered several items on my Amazon account in January, which came to a substantial amount of money, some of my items were delivered, when I tried to go onto my account to check when the rest of my items were due to be delivered, Amazon had closed my account. I have tried to contact them to find out why, and to try and get the money back for the items I have not received, and I get passed around to different departments, no one can help me, no one can tell me why my account was closed, no one can tell me where my items are. One of the items that did come I need to return as it is faulty and because I cannot get in to my account I can’t return it or get the order number! Customer service are useless, often have been very rude.",0
I am very happy with Amazon. I have purchased 2 bikes from them and had them shipped to another state. They both arrived perfectly.,2
Service is acceptable. easy to order.,1
customer service is the worst ive ever dealt with.,0
"Amazon have become very poor recently. If you're not a Prime member, the service is 3rd rate. I've had orders cancelled even though the product is in stock,  orders delivered late and customer service are little help. I now find that I'm not able to leave a review for a product, because I haven't met the minimum criteria.The worse they become, the less I use them and so they become even worse; it's a downward spiral. They're simply not interested in you without the 'loyalty card' of Prime membership.",0
"Amazon shopping refuse to post review & makes it hard to find within the app itself but ask to review about everything""We’d love to know how everything worked out with you. Please take a moment to review your most recent item(s)."". Their response to refuse is because ""We couldn't post your review because it focuses on one or more of these topics: Sellers, Delivery, Packaging, Pricing, Availability"". Doesn't this encompass everything?",0
"I ordered a shower curtain, from amazon. It was about $25.00 or so, I wasn't happy with the curtain, so I set up a return with amazon, they picked it up a few days later, got an email from amazon, they got the package, and where refunding $15.00 to my account. With no heads up, where keeping half your money. So that will be the LAST item I buy from amazon. I wouldn't have given them a 1 star rating.",0
Okay customer assistance but their shipment is amazing,1
I wish I could rate of zero I’ve had those experience with Amazon! The customer service representatives do not understand English most of them are overseas. Manager was totally belligerent has no empathy for anything I waited over 10 hours for UPS to come pick up the package and all she did was cancel my return expecting me to wait another day at home with no resolution,0
"Start your free trial, they say.  Then you click the button and you immediately pay $7.49/month.  So misleading.  Such a disaster of a company; for employees, for the earth, for small honest reasonable businesses.",0
Always like using amazon but waste of packaging for little items. Not very decent. Service is great though,1
I have been ordering from Amazon for years.  I have always gotten my items in a timely matter and the items looked exactly as promised.,2

"Prices are still fine but support going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer support and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"Its clear from reviews that customer service via India is the worst possible service available in the current market.  It is also clear that Amazon as a mega giant does not care one bit.  I have just spent two days and spoken to 5 people,  used the chat 3 times and am still, actually more, aggravated than than when i began.  The phone connection is inconsistent and full of static.  The people  accents are very hard to understand. I am first generation American and no stranger to accents but these reps are very garbled in their translation.  First I have twice been told an item that was never delivered would be replaced and that has never happened.  Frankly at this point I feel that they outright lie.  They lie and have no problem with it. And amazon as a company has no problem with the fact that the CS people lie and do not actually follow up on issues.  Second the delivery person here in USA is repeatedly delivering to the wrong address and no one seems to be doing anything about it. One rep actually told me they cannot follow up on something like that.  The items are going to the wrong address so often it seems to be purposeful.  Unfortunately there is no way for me to contact amazon delivery.  i tell india CS it is happening and they say they cannot contact anyone here.",0

"Good assistance, with fast shipment, however they сheet us, if you have an Amazon prime they said shipment is free, but one time I checked same item from Amazon account of my friend with no Prime and them I decided to place order from my Amazon account with Prime, and the price with free shipment was same as in regular account + shipment cost.",1
Amazon has always provided great products and at cheapest prices The delivery drivers are the issue not the company itself,2
I order few household item in the last week from Amazon in Vancouver Canada and all have been delivered timely. Very very happy.,2
I probably spend 100K a year+ here for my business.they keep trying to get me to have a business account but from what I was told it would nix the free shipping on a ton of items.. why would I do that? it just doesnt seem worth it.,1
"Gave Amazon Japan another go for a neck care device . Here's the quick take : On the plus side, the order was quick and they also allow you to deliver to a local score which is very convenient. On the downside the device was quite porly packaged and I'd have returned it if it wasn't for the pain with getting in touch with customer support . However I have to say the device works well and for less than ¥3,000 I am pretty satisfied ",1
Amazon has completely now blocked anyway to get live chat w/customer service...my last order of stand mixer was delivered on the back of a motor scooter....upside down and tied on the back with string....turned on and making terrible noise....no live chat so  AI says i have to ship back at my expense and will not receive full refund until Amazon receives and approves returned condition...then 30 days to refund....I WILL NEVER BUY FROM SCAMMER AMAZON AGAIN!!!!!,0
Using AmazonExcellent service and delivery of all goods on time. So far my expectations re quality and standards have been fulfilled. Well done.,2
Amazon is a joke! Consumers need to wake and start supporting our local retailers. They are only getting worse as far customer service and paying for prime ha ha joke. Use that for gas money and pick it up at the local store. Stop supporting these fulfillment centers with poor customer service and fulfillment capabilities. It’s all about the contract negotiations not the consumer. I understand the need to house inventory but this is not the route. They are providing poor quality and customer service. My husband spends thousands of dollars and I refuse too. I have finally persuaded him too stop spending money with Amazon...🙌🏽🙌🏽 I would rather walk into my local store with my receipt and have things taken care of with some level of accountability. Start supporting your local retailers again. Amazon is a hustle and pulling it off as a honest company “for the consumer”. They are hustlers.Sincerely Tired of being ripped off!,0
Amazon is without a doubt the best online retailer.  In over 10 years I've had an issue maybe 2 or 3 times and if I do I use their chat service and my issue is fixed immediately.  I order from Amazon at least 3 to 4 times a week.  I love Prime and use it almost every day.  There isn't an online retailer (or any retailer) that can match their FREE return policy or their shipping times if you have Prime.  I love Amazon and if anyone doesn't they aren't doing something right.,2
Bought some cctv fittings about 2 weeks ago which were all delivered on time! I also received them in very good condition! Excellent service!!,2
Very quick speedy delivery service and problems dealt with extremely quickly,2
"I never thought I will be writing a negative review for Amazon 0.o but here goes. Things have clearly changed with Amazon deliveries. I’ve got another (second already) order stuck on “there was a problem with delivery” status. You can’t reschedule, you can’t cancel, you’re advised to contact Amazon but I’ve spent 20 min looking around for a way to contact them and no luck. It’s truly ridiculous and Amazon just went from providing one of the best e-commerce experiences around to a shockingly bad one! I mean what the actual ... ! Can’t even get a bloody refund!",0
Utterly appauling experience with Amazon and as such have emailed their UK CEO and may relay to Trading Standards/their regulator. Amazon Prime Membership default unless deleted is yet another issue that is most annoying and needs deleting. ,0
I absolutely love Amazon. The entire shopping on Amazon.com experience is stress free and they have almost everything I need without the waiting in line and their return policy is amazing.  Wish I had bought stock back when they first got started. More companies should model their customer service. Keep up the good work Amazon.,2

"Amazon.com is perfect for customers. I do buy on Amazon and they offer good service. Most of third party sellers are great and Amazon its self without the doubt has the best service. However, when it comes to treating sellers they are horrible. They communicate with you as a seller like you are a criminal or a thief. Very rude and unprofessional.  I hope Amazon do something about their seller Central and take care of its sellers.",0
"So I've had 2 x customer related experiences today, granted the Amazon one wasn't perfect, I spent 50mins on the phone getting passed from department to department and in the end I just had to hang up, but at least they did listen - in the end it was resolved in 5 mins via chat. The other customer experience was with eharmony and was the complete opposite, WON'T LISTEN, DON'T LISTEN replying often with non relevant copy and pastes and aren't good at hiding that all they care about is revenue - I didn't get this feeling with amazon it felt like they did care and did listen.",2

"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer assistance at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1
Amazon has had so many hiccups over the year I question if even shipping here is worth it anymore.,1
"It was a time when Amazon was a really decent company,  but now it seems to be just another one just like the other. One of my problems I have with them is their shipment.  I'm a prime member and have been for years but now that doesn't matter to Amazon.  We order often and our home sits slightly up off of the street in a cul de sac and we have the ring and it shows them delivering. I have called, complained and also written instructions with orders and on the account not to walk in the yard on the grass but only walk on the driveway. Well no one cares and they park at the driveway and walk straight through our yard which is well taken care of. Years back they never did this and they have no respect for the customers property.  I will be canceling my prime and shop for what I need elsewhere. ",1

I ordered a EGO mower via Amazon.com ($5300 purchase). The shipping company the seller used refused to deliver the mower to my home and it was sent back to the seller without ever being in my possession. Amazon has a A-Z guarantee that states they will refund your money if an item is not delivered. Today I got an email from Amazon stating that I am not eligible for the a-z guarantee and therefore will not refund my money. No explanation of why they say I am not eligible.   I have been a loyal customer for many years and recommended them to many of my friends. No longer will I do any business with them and will tell my friends to not use them also. I would rather spend more and pay shipping on items than give them one more cent of my money.,0

"My parcel was left outside the main multi occupancy building again because they couldn't be bothered to bring it to my own personal front door. I have ostio arthritis in both knees and hips.

We have a small carpark outside and although private we do have people who are not a resident come and use it. The parcel could be taken by anyone.I have paid for delivery to my door. It has not been. They either don't know how to use the panel to gain access or they can't be bothered. Therefore I should not be charged delivery. I am thinking to cancel my account because of this.

I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1

"I ABSOLUTELY will be closing my Amazon account. HATE this company!!!!!!Now they have made it so I need a ""Smart"" phone to receive a link to access my account. Because I do not have a smart phone, I have to put an EXTREMELY long address on my computer. This company has gotten too huge- will no longer give them my dollars!",0
It seems Amazon think that free order is what you pay for!,1
Don't know why anyone could give less than 5 stars as since my husband passed away in February l have shopped more than usual with them and if not in items always left in my secure place.,2
"I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.",1
"I am disappointed with the delivery. Not only is Amazon price gouging, but they are pushing back delivery of essential products needed for families. I ordered mask and gloves and they continue to push the delivery dates back for prime members. This is a disgrace and I am out of my mask and gloves so we are just stuck I guess.",0
I can say I’ve never had a problem with amazon  they’re great👍😀they’re life savers,2
"Doesn’t let you remove next day shipment on certain items, find this annoying",1
Amazon has always gotten my packages to me quickly and efficiently. Anytime I've had a problem it has been sorted out without a problem. I would recommend Amazon to anyone!,2
"Been using Amazon for 12 years, when I first started using everything was great, but since Covid the support has been lacking when it come to shipment time and the third party sellers. And its crazy since the Amazon fulfillment center is less than ten miles near my house. Hopefully once things settle down things will improve especially with quality goodss.",1
A trusted siteA trusted site. I always get my items in a timely manner and they offer anything and everything you see on adds on facebook without it being a scam site which means alot to me sense I have been scammed more then once on those sites. The items are exactly what you see on order site and are good quality,2
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their support, their goodss and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer support representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
Love the benefits but the prices are expensive relatively The reviews are hard to figure if they are real or promoted or spam love the free shipping if the price is comparable,1
"Literally the biggest shambles of lies and rubbish, waited a full month for a refund, now fighting over a refund for postage even though the item sent was wrong, been promised a refund twice this week and now being told I have to contact the seller who’s ignored me for a full month. Advisors lie and fob you off, none of them have a clue. I’m sure Amazon won’t miss my business and likewise I won’t miss their incompetence, lies and total grief that this shower manage to give out. Good riddence!",0

"For the third time, my delivery was sent to the wrong address. Dumb courier even takes a picture of it and it’s not my door. All Amazon will do is refund my money and told me I now have time to go buy something at the store. What’s the point of ordering online to now only be rushed to the store to hopefully find the same thing before my nephew’s birthday party tomorrow. I spend money every month on Prime so I can go to the store and buy it at a higher price.....they suck.",0
I have bought a fair number of different items from Amazon from a television for the living room to much smaller items. Amazon sell just about everything you could want for the house or everyday use at a range of qualities and prices. The prices are normally very good prices,2

Excellent customer service . Easy to contact them . Their online chat service is very helpful and reliable with experienced staff who can always sort out any issues that I might have . Their contact services are 100percent more efficient than eBay who are impossible to contact right now . I know I can rely on Amazon at all times to help me sort out any issues and their staff are both experienced and friendly . I can honestly say that they have always helped me if I needed them too .,2
"I love Amazon. They have a great range of products at competitive prices. They arent as cheap as ebay - but you have the Amazon guarantee which you dont with e-bay and thats worth paying a little more for the peace of mind.A tip is that its always worth checking out the Amazon price with free delivery before buying form someone else on Amazon, becasue although there prices may appear cheaper than Amazons, by the time you add on postage Amazon nearly always is cheaper.Customer service is superb. Why shop naywhere else?",2
"Easy to use, fast shipping, discounts for college students.",2

"I am really disappointed with Amazon.  I have been a loyal customer for the last 6 years.  Have made several orders.  Once I ordered a laptop and the screen was broken.  I had no way of getting a refund.  They over charged me for orders for Sales tax and delivery during the pandemic, and now I'm locked out of my account. I tried calling customer service but they couldn't solve me issue. They never appreciated me as a loyal customer after all these years.  I think I'm done with them.

After trying all other options (hacking not their fault), I then added a gift card to use, but Amazon won't let me check out with my paid for gift card unless I put another payment method on the account as well, even as a guest.  So, another loss I have to this company! I will never use Amazon again, and I was their biggest fan for so long!!  But, I'm cutting my losses!",0
If I could give it a Zero Stars I would.Come to find out I was being double billed for almost 3 years.Partially my fault and I accept my responsibility.However when I tried to rectify the issue I was passed around to SIx different customer service representatives.The last representative I talked to on the the phone kept coming back on the phone and told me several times we're working on the issue and to hold the line.I did and 1 hour and 20 minutes later I realized I was screwed.I cancelled my account once and for all.After years of being a decent customer I will never return.Please watch your account and email .,0
Very good app for shopping a lot of things are available on it ,2
"They make political stances thinking they know what best for my interests. They can't seem to get my delivery days correct, I know people who work for Amazon and they get treated like crap. They treat their deliver service providers like crap. I know a few. I don't think they realize that they are customers as well. But they wouldn't care anyways. When you have an issue, there's nobody who cares to help you.",0
Love Amazon. Loads of great deals and all items purchased have always been delivered without any problems at all.,2
They are decent about some things but there are some thing on the site that when you buy the will not get back to you. They will take you money and not return it or get back to you on where it’s at.,1
"I absolutely love Amazon. They've been a very reliable hub to shop from, with absolutely no problems in anything I've purchased on their site (from the company itself nor the independent merchants).  I've bought books, computer hardware, games, music, jewelery, guitar accessories, and clothes from Amazon, and everything has been top notch service. Delivery estimates either exactly when they say, or my items arrived earlier than expected, and well packaged.",2
I have absolutely loved Amazon in the past but the last couple of months they have really disappointed me. I’m a Prime subscriber and have normally received my purchases in several days. Perfect! But lately it has been taking weeks….to not at all! Has anyone else been experiencing this. I’m truly bummed and disappointed as all get out!,1
"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience. I don't know seller, if he is not responding you, I bought it because of your trust, Order number :- 403-3552607-1022716Deepak #amazon #onlineshopping #scammersALERT #amazonsale #amazondeals #AmazonCustomer #amazoncheat",0
"Where is customer service? it seems that amazon only has robots, if everything goes Ok, it's ok, if something goes wrong, ""computer says no"" Very concerning company. I would not like to rely on it, but people think: what if there is not any other company left?and you would have to buy essential stuff to live? And ""computer says no""?",0
Can never fault the fast delivery and selection of products available. Great service and the customer service is outstanding.,2
Ehhh its great and all but they gotta give more opportunities to peepple to make money,2
Worst customer service they don’t listen send you the wrong information for making a return no one is helpful .  They need better training they ask you to repeat over and over .,0
Amazon you have been amazing throughout this pandemic. Especially throughout this Christmas season. You're agents have been super polite and helpful. Thank you.,2
"Ive started doing all my shopping on line now given my health. I found amazon very dependable and the delivery people so much friendlier than others. I think that they should look at their packaging though, its a bit silly sometimes",2
I have a membership and it doesn't even matter. Amazon false advertises their delivery times and customer service is terrible. I would not recommend this company. It may seem fast and convenient  but honestly you'd have better luck just ordering from Walmart and ANY OTHER STORE Don't waste your money,0
Best for goods delivery and transportation ,2
"I ordered a Jump Lead starter pack, the item was ordered to an Amazon locker hub. It never arrived, apparently delivery failed, I did not receive a code to any locker.  Amazon assured me my item would arrive next day, it didn’t.  I called Amazon who said I would be issued a refund to the original payment method, only to find out they refunded money to a gift card. When I called again today to query the advisor called me a liar and said I requested refund to a gift card!  Now I have £50.99 sitting on a gift card and not in my account.When I tried to explain I was told the refund would go back to my original payment method she hung up on me.Amazon have lost my trust and custom.",0

"I've ordered from Amazon countless times, most of the time I do get the packages. Sadly now and then they fail to deliver the items, and just recently they've failed once again to deliver.To say that it's annoying is an understatement. Clearly they really need to improve on this. 3 stars because they have previously managed to deliver items, but also failed to deliver items.",1
I would give you guys 10 stars if I could! The most responsive and understanding costumer service I have ever dealt with! They do anything even if it's not really required in order to make you a happy costumer! Will definitely keep using Amazon for everything!,2

"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime assistance, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1
Delivered on time but usually just dump it on doorstep,1
Buy most of my online shopping from them rarely get any problems but when I do they sort it out quickly I love Amazon,2
"Attempted to order multiple items from a baby gift registry.  I was prompted to remove the items from the registry after selecting them but then the items disappeared without giving me the opportunity to add them to my cart.  Then I searched again for the items only to find out they were no longer on the registry even tho I never got the opportunity to add them to my cart.  I called customer service since I wanted to ship them to the recipient's address but I got disconnected.  Then I called the main customer service number only to hear that due to COVID19, they can't help customers at this time and was instructed via a machine to chat online. I went online to chat then someone called me but I got disconnected again.  After several attempts I found out one of the products wasn't approved for shipment to my State. Additionally, I was told I wasn't the only call experiencing those issues and the gift registry dept was inundated with these types of calls...i.e. being prompted to remove items from a registry without getting the opportunity to add them to my cart.  Since there were only 3 other items on the registry, I attempted to get a gift card only to find out I can't use my amazon credit for that.  This was absolutely the worst customer service I ever encountered for an online company that supposedly is closing retail shops left and right!  I hope consumers wake up and realize what is happening...they are trying to create a monopoly so customers don't have other options.  I urge people to support retail businesses that are more customer service friendly rather than support a company that only hires people to ship overpriced items.",0
"Used To Be Excellent.I have been with Amazon and Amazon Prime for over a decade and they have been excellent in every way a few hitches but it’s to be expected and was dealt with .The last couple of years the assistance has got steadily worse , prices are in some cases ( majority) very much higher , I recently return ed items which basically were not fit for purpose and received from Amazon an email threatening to close my account for returning to much but if you send me clearly used decents or decents which are not as shown I shall return them but Amazon are not interested, the deliveries are decent on the whole but had things throw over fences dumped on car bonnet .. I have cctv so know when the driver lies .Prime is not really worth it as a lot of the films are just really cheap budgeted movies you wouldn’t watch anyway . After the last email threatening to close a very active account I am thinking now to take the lead and pull the plug on Amazon.Once they were excellent but I think they have now grown to big and offer very poor value for money",1

"Had a transaction for over £500 made on my account, only way I found it was that there was an address in the USA on my delivery addresses. They'd archived the order.At no point in the thieving little c*nts purchases did Amazon have any system that might have queried why £500 worth of stuff was going to the USA under a different name (internet security 101)Tried contacting them and the customer services are completely useless. Talk about the Spanish inquisition! No I don't know some random yahoo in America! They've made a serious balls up and will have to investigate before I get my money back.Hold your hands up and admit your security systems are crap and refund me immediately. If the shoe was on the other foot it would be slightly different. Take criminal activity going on in your business seriously!",0
Amazon.com is a reaily great shopping Webdite and app for all. The product of amazon is 99.00 pure and good. I use Amazon over 5 years.,2

"I love Amazon, for the supports they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the goodss or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' usages. Typical corporate America. No matter how many decent things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
"Everything okay, sometimes I get order faster sometimes not. I only buy through Amazon, not 3rd person. But one annoying thing they do not accept different recensions than 100% positive, if you wanna put truly opinion they will not accept your recension. That's scamming of people.",1
Worst delivery service ever! I can order from Amazon.de and have it delivered faster than Amazon.nl and I live in NL! There is no excuse when what I order is through Amazon fulfillment center. Amazon.nl prices are also higher for the same item! Never again will I order from Amazon.nl!,0

Amazon has a program called amazon smile, where part of your purchase can be donated to a charity of your choice if you opt into the program. However, Amazon only allows you to participate in donating to these charities if you have your notifications turned on, which allows Amazon to send marketing messages--a suggestive sales technique. If you turn off notifications, amazon turns off your ability to donate part of your purchase to charities.",0

GREAT except the price is now more than doubled at $12.99. this is a scam as far as I am concerned. I believe when companies like Crosman raises there prices Amazon cancels any item not shipped due to some magic error, so they can get the higher commission on it. I have seen this with private seller alot were an item was won at auction and the seller thinks the price was too low so magically ""it was sold in our store""",0

I chatted with customer service three times and they didn't remove the ""keep watching Sky Captain""My impression is that they are doing that on purpose and that is evil and idiot.  They won. Amazon is their company but the door is mine. I will not watch Amazon Prime as long as the ""keep watching Sky C"" is on. I will not renew my subscription on November 5th. You can keep the Expanse.

I have tried to have packages picked up for that don't live hear any more 1 customer service rep saide they would call back with someone to pick it up and never called back the 2nd person said that couldn't be done, just keep the package. This is a billion dollar business that they can not even have people trained is the same manner. If anyone else in the really world would do this they would be fired or the business would be shut  down.",0
Usually like their support but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1

"The customer support is really ordinary !,the representatives are nasty , not education at all and they don't have knowledege at all , about the company and din't care about the custoner , I think amazon should hire better employees and also better salaries !!, thank you !",1
"What ever happened to 2-day shipping for Amazon Prime membership?  And why isn't there a link somewhere about the Amazon website to contact customer support?  Why does it take about 5 minutes (not exaggerating) to drill down, answer questions, meet criteria and generally jump through hoops in order to get to the point where you can ask a question of a customer support rep?  I get that its HUGE but does that exonerate them from basic business practices and being available to their customers?  Is it impossible to imagine that there are some questions that can't be answered by the options they offer up in a list?The COVID pandemic wreaked havoc upon society worldwide and created new standards and expectations for and about work, workers, customers, customer supports, etc. and during that time it was impossible to fulfill Prime membership benefits like 2-day shipping, but it's long since and they've not yet reinstated the 2-day shipping policy. Go to amazon and look up prime membership benefits and the list includes video and kindle and music benefits but, all of those come with a monthly subscription fee separate from the $139 annual fee for Prime membership.  The shipping benefits listed for Prime Membership reflect two-day shipping on ""select"" items, so perhaps just the ""select"" item list got pared back during COVID and has never been 're-augmented'?Whatever the answer, I'm not sure Amazon prime membership is worth it anymore - certainly not if you're paying for it monthly; but perhaps even the annual membership doesn't make sense?It's rare that I need anything the next day or even two-days later and I'll frequently select shipment on my amazon shipment day, but when I do need something within' two-days, I'm finding Walmart to be more receptive to those needs (and they often deliver the next day AND on Sundays). Me thinks Amazon has gotten too big for it's britches and forgets the trail-blazing they once did only to foist buggy support upon us now. And don't get me started on dropping Amazon returns at a Whole Foods, especially one in NYC  The Upper East Side Whole Foods at 87th & 3rd has a huge Amazon Returns sign with that big smiley swoosh beneath it, so you know you're in the right place, but there's no additional signage to tell you to go to the Mezzanine which is accessible only by elevator (don't take the escalator bc it bypasses the Mezz altogether).",1
Ordered a vanity set for my daughter and the item is defective. It came damaged and cannot put it together. their customer service is terrible and would not allow me to return bc I was past a 30 day return window that I wasn't aware of. I was told they would send me manufacturers info by email but the link in the email was bad and was for an entirely different product and customer service keeps giving me the run around. Terrible customer service and a waste of $200,0
"Absolute worst company ever. Their customer service is terrible. I don’t know how they can possibly stay in business if this continues. In the past month, I’ve ordered 20 items. 5 of them have been late, 2 have been the wrong thing, and 2 never arrived. Of these 20 items, I’ve returned a total of 4 items. 2 because they were the wrong thing and 2 because they just were not what I was expecting.Of the two that never arrived, Amazon was so reluctant to refund me, they kept telling me to wait it out. The most frustrating thing was my orders showed if the item didn’t arrived by “__”date, then I should return and I would be refunded. When I did this, they asked me to wait longer. After reattempting this 3 times over the course of 6 days, each time they did the same thing. Finally, I was refunded. 2 other items I’ve chatted about and the reps have told me on separate occasions that I don’t need to return the item and I would be refunded. I then donated the items because they were what I needed, and a week later, I have no refunds. I chatted with their CS and they said I needed to return the items in order to be refunded. I told the reps that I didn’t have them anymore because I donated them since the last reps told me I didn’t need to return the items. You can guess how this ended… no refund. I told Amazon that I would send them a screenshot from the previous reps. They still would not refund me, they said that the other reps made a mistake and that I still would need to return the items. I am absolutely dumbfounded. These people just don’t get it. I’ve never seen a company contradict themselves more than Amazon. It is beyond frustrating. Their CRM system or whatever they use is horrendous. How terrible customer service that you don’t keep previous customer correspondence or stick to your word. It’s complete bogus. This company used to be pretty good, but now it’s the most frustrating company to purchase from. So sickening.",0
when i order something it comes broken im very anoyed;;;;;;))))))))))))))))))),1
"I contacted customer service a few weeks ago to ask whether or not I would be reimbursed for expensive postage fees on a return I was making, and customer service told me more than once that yes, absolutely, I would be reimbursed up to £150 for postage costs. With this in mind I purchased postage via UPS which ended up costing £177.30. Now, however, Amazon is refusing to reimburse me, and every time I contact customer service to find out why and how to get my money back, they end the chat and ignore my issue. I've literally been lied out of £150 by a multi-billion dollar company. This is shameful and I will without a doubt be closing my account after this. I have told my friends and family about this and many of them have agreed that this was the last straw and that they will also no longer be using Amazon. You've got billions of pounds to play with, but you'll refuse to give me £150 that you promised me? Catch yourself on.",0
"My parcel was left outside the main multi occupancy building again because they couldn't be bothered to bring it to my own personal front door. I have ostio arthritis in both knees and hips. I live at the end of a corridor. It is quicker for a fit person to delivery to my door than for me to go all the way along a corridor and down into the lift to the ground floor and having to bend to retrieve my parcel from outside the main door where anyone can take it. We have a small carpark outside and although private we do have people who are not a resident come and use it. The parcel could be taken by anyone.I have paid for delivery to my door. It has not been. They either don't know how to use the panel to gain access or they can't be bothered. Therefore I should not be charged delivery. I am thinking to cancel my account because of this. All I ask is that if I am paying for delivery, please deliver to my own personal door and not outside a multi occupancy building.",0

My son ordered the Lego R2D2. It arrived today and on inspection 3 of the packs had been opened and resealed. Ironically the packs which had been opened contained the parts which make up the mini figures. Both of which are 2 of the ones which are highly collectible. All Amazon say when contacted they said to refer to Lego. This has never happened with items bought from Lego. Someone is making a bit on the side opening these packages!!!,0

I wrote a review for Amazon but it may not have been accepted by them as it was critical of them.",1

we bought a hot tub from Amazon which we had to return as faulty and they gave us a refund and we bought another one. We returned the item and showed proof of this with tracked return and then 30 days later they sent a message saying reversed the refund and they had taken the money out of our account- nearly £500 which we has caused us to have no money in account and when we phoned they agreed they had made a mistake and said they would rectify but would take 5 days leaving us with no money. they made the mistake and disgusting and not willing to do any  more about it but said this is rare scenario and should not cause inconvenience to you.

"I used to be a huge Amazon promoter. Their prices might have been slightly higher but reasonable when factoring in the whole experience including shipping times, customer service, ease returns etc. They will tell you that their shipping times remain unchanged, based on the fact that it's 2 days from the actual shipping of the item. The reality is I used to receive things in 2 or three days depending on the time of day I ordered it. Most days they'd ship it out the same day. Now they have a built in 5 day delay to ship resulting in 1 week delivery. Walmart plus still has true 2 day shipping. I'm cancelling my Prime subscription.",0
I am not getting OTPs sent to my phone in South Africa which has worked for decades  it suddenly stopped working yesterday. Now that phone number has been blocked. I’ve spent 3 hours on chat and phone calls with Amazon Cistomer Support where I repeated the simple problem over and over and over again and no one could help. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. No exaggeration. So we set up a new account with my wife’s details which was fine. When we tried to enter hýe ozone number once again no OTP arrived at her phone. They keep on insisting we are making the error and yet it is their system. I e been using Amazon and the OTP for many years and it suddenly stops working but not one of the 12 customer service agents could help,0

"Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on items (like baby items) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.  So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of items, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not. I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt acceptable for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon. The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.",1
"No angry hate words but I was one of their biggest fan until they slowly became bad in every way, Where do I start!

Just bad.And if you’re not happy with the product or the service, you can’t leave reviews like before! You can’t say it’s late! Or didn’t arrive ! They have new policy that takes away that right from you, their main focus is on profit, then more profit, and without premium good luck getting your items shipped! honestly it’s much faster ordering them from any website than amazon, and that’s not even half what I don’t like about them .... leaving Amazon for good after long years of a loyal premium member...",0

Thank you to all of the employees world wide to make those of us at home lives better. Amazon is not a perfect company, but we don’t live in a perfect world. They are doing a great job!

I then had to talk to customer assistance and the person I spoke with did not really understand what I was even talking about. It was incredibly frustrating.

Never again will I buy anything on Amazon. On numerous occasions I’ve received damaged products or fake products and The worst is purchasing from a third party company that sends suspicious products and will fight you tooth and nail to keep their money No matter what your issue may be.

"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a support that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this support. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1

"UNTRUSTWORTHY, and are NOT to be believed!.......PERIODProve me incorrect!",0
Amazon is a joke! Consumers need to wake and start supporting our local retailers. They are only getting worse as far customer service and paying for prime ha ha joke. Use that for gas money and pick it up at the local store. Stop supporting these fulfillment centers with poor customer service and fulfillment capabilities. It’s all about the contract negotiations not the consumer. I understand the need to house inventory but this is not the route. They are providing poor quality and customer service. My husband spends thousands of dollars and I refuse too. I have finally persuaded him too stop spending money with Amazon...🙌🏽🙌🏽 I would rather walk into my local store with my receipt and have things taken care of with some level of accountability. Start supporting your local retailers again. Amazon is a hustle and pulling it off as a honest company “for the consumer”. They are hustlers.Sincerely Tired of being ripped off!,0
Amazon is a great site to get premium products at a affordable price.Their products always come well packed and are on time.,2
I am impressed with how quick they sent me my CD's,2
"I can't begin to describe how far Amazon has fallen over the years.  I was a customer from the beginning.  I was with Prime shortly after it came out.  I seriously thought it was the best company in the world, until it wasn't.  Then it wasn't even close.  Amazon now has among the worst customer service I encounter anywhere.  It rivals Comcast and Verizon Fios for the worst service you can even conceive of.  There's literally no way to describe the thousand ways Amazon fails at basic stuff.  It's service is a nightmare now.  You're sent off to a foreign country, with people who are supremely unhelpful, with the simplest issues taking hours to resolve.  I'm over it.  I no longer trust Amazon.  It's that simple.  Most recent case in point: I called Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Amazon store card, to pay my bill.  It said the balance was over $400, so I thought I'd go through to a live person and see what the purchases were, to make sure nothing was unauthorized.  I recognized every purchase, except one.  There was an $11 charge for Amazon digital services.  I knew I hadn't authorized any digital purchases, so told them to put me through to Amazon.  The Indian man I spoke with was completely unhelpful.  Mind you, I mean him or anyone else no disrespect for being foreign.  He spoke with a thick accent likely because English was his second language.  GOOD FOR HIM.  It's something to be proud of.  But it also makes it very difficult to take care of issues that have any degree of complexity at all. He insisted I definitely ordered Amazon Music Unlimited, because I played [unintelligible] on my Alexa device.  What was the name of it?  ""It was [unintelligible]""  HUH?  SAY THAT AGAIN SLOWLY?  Literally, his accent was so thick I couldn't tell at all what he was saying.  After repeating it a fourth time, I made out the word ""noise.""  It hit me that Amazon was charging me $11 a month to play ""brown noise"" on my bedroom Alexa device.  I've played that as a background sleep noise for YEARS.  Didn't start in December.  I've literally played it for about 3-5 years, every single night.  Suddenly it apparently started charging me for it in December.  I never heard it ask me ANYTHING about a subscription and certainly never agreed to any such thing.  But that didn't convince this Amazon rep, who apparently could read my mind and insisted I absolutely did order it.  I grew increasingly annoyed, especially as he kept going silent for 20, 30, 40 seconds at a time without saying a word, no hold or anything.. just silence.  Finally I told him, ""why are you being silent?  I don't know what you're doing.""  He then hung up on me.  So much for customer service.  I called angrier now and spoke with a second rep.  She was so very sorry the first rep hung up on me.  If I would just take more time out of my Saturday night to explain everything all over again and verify myself again... which I had no choice but to do.  She took a complaint on the last rep, but said she couldn't help me.  I'd have to be transferred to Amazon music.  Mind you, by this time it's nearly 1 am in the morning on a Sunday morning.  She puts me on hold... and I wait and I wait and wait some more.  About 15 minutes she comes back and says ""I'm sorry for the long wait.  I'm still in the queue to speak with Amazon music.""  I told her I would wait.  She puts me back on hold... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass.  Finally I had to give up.  She never came back on the line to say anything.  Just the same canned music playing over and over and over and over on a loop.  Called again.  Asked for a supervisor, but my phone died because I'd been held on the line so long.  He didn't call back.  I gave up because I had to give up.  Otherwise, I'd have a stroke from my anger and high blood pressure.  Amazon, you suck. Every single time I have a problem now, this is what I encounter.  Amazon is no longer a great company.  It's a company that will cut every corner, that disrespects its customers and their time, and that cares only about its bottom line.  It will go the way of Sears because it deserves to.  ",0
"I love shopping with Amazon.com because they make it so easy, and I am always satisfied with everything I buy.  They also offer so much in the product line.  I really like the ability to purchase music through the Amazon MP3 and choose only the songs I want, and the Amazon Cloud is great!",2
I have used amazon for years & have only had positive expirences with them.,2

I have absolutely loved Amazon in the past but the last couple of months they have really disappointed me. I’m a Prime subscriber and have normally received my purchases in several days. Perfect! But lately it has been taking weeks….to not at all! Has anyone else been experiencing this. I’m truly bummed and disappointed as all get out!,1
They sell cheap Chinese products I never saw American made products,0

"Overall amazon is a very solid company and selling online market. It’s not flawless and the are clear and obvious flaws. However take away those flaws and you get a very solid and reasonable company. Lots of availability. Great items but sometimes lets me down with the shipment. But overall it’s very fine and trustworthy. If the a issue it’s always handled with professionalism and fine integrity. Which I like. It’s a great company with great resources that provide fast, efficient online shopping usage.",1
i ordered goods using amazon prime  less  than 15 hours i just got it fantastic service highly recommend amazon prime,2
Almost always perfect. Occasional mistakes but when they happen customer service is great.,2
"I've never had to call Amazon specifically for anything, however, if you do decide to order through Amazon, you NEED Amazon Prime. I didn't think it would be worth it, but it definitely is. Considering you get to watch movies and shows and get 2-day shipping, it's amazing. I give it 4 stars because there have been multiple instances where I will have items in my cart and I will get an e-mail the next day stating my item was ordered (this has happened like 3 times) so then I have to go through the hassle of sending it back.",2
"PACKAGING!!!!! Im very disappointed that less packaging has not been implemented yet- despite what Amazon keeps saying!?! My last order was ridiculous - a huge box with paper stuffing and bubble wrap for a 30ml bottle!?! And I didn’t order it on rush, it was a regular shipped item. What a waste!! Please please reconsider how you package items!",0
Pretty reliable but prefer boutique shopping.,1
The shipment hours aren't guaranteed anymore you order early for 6 - 10pm shipment check back Amazon has changed day & time to when you aren't home. Ordered also for Sat 1pm shipment all 5 items lost in transit. I have to wait 5 - 7 days for money back when Amazon never dispatched items.,1

There was a promised delivery date when I ordered. After order suddenly the delivery date was unknown but still they send me an invoice and expecte me to pay for it before I received the goods. And the support told me the stock is not updated in real time. That is absolutely ridiculous to have a system you can't trust for items in stock.,0
Absolutely the worst customer service in the history of all customer service on the planet,0
This is the best platform for me because which i order from this olatform was decent item and satisfied.I realy like this platform,1
"I always use it. Prices are high, but it's easy to manage your orders, easy (and more important, free) to get a refund. I wonder why wish has 4.3 stars review and Amazon has 2. I don't recommend it for DIY electronics, the prices are really bad, better use Aliexpress, keeping in mind to pay with Paypal 'cause many sellers there are scammers.",2
"Happy with the purchase I made but I don't like the offer and stuff of amazon prime, i don't like the idea.",1
"Amazon is so awful, half the stuff in my packages are always missing, items delivered to the wrong houses, entire packages not showing up. Then they try and tell me I’ve had too many refunds on my account… due to them messing up every order I place. Doing my head in",0
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new shipment system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a shipment but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" shipment. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
"I love Amazon, always fast shipping!",2
"My brother has a prime membership I use, for some reason his card got decline. And my card got charged couple of times. Called amazon customer service but they won’t provide me the last four digits of my brothers card so I can talk to him about it how come they can’t provide me that last four digits but they can charge my own card WITHOUT my authorization? WITHOUT my consent? And they won’t return my money? This is a BS policy that you have and you need to change it! !!",0
I used to buy most everything with ebay but now most purchases are with amazon. The prime program is unbeatable.,2
Ordered black contact paper for my daughters school project and they sent me the wrong thing. Spoke with customer service which is outsourced to who knows where and spoke with someone I couldn't even understand. Finally it was understood tjat a replacement would be sent....well...they sent the exact same wrong item and I couldn't get the correct color in time for the project. My daughter is autistic and it made her have a complete meltdown and the project had to be late. Now I have to take time out of my workday to mail the wrong items back so I can get a refund.  Poorly handled Amazon...poorly handled.,0
"They can update a website, filter category is not helpful",1
"Gave Amazon Japan another go for a neck care device . Here's the quick take : On the plus side, the shipment was quick and they also allow you to deliver to a local score which is very convenient. On the downside the device was quite porly packaged and I'd have returned it if it wasn't for the pain with getting in touch with customer assistance . However I have to say the device works well and for less than ¥3,000 I am pretty satisfied ",1
Criminals. They offer an item with lower price than the competition then don’t deliver the item and offer a refund. It’s a scam. I will never buy from Amazon again.,0
This is honestly one of the most gross things that have happened to me while ordering Amazon fresh I ordered mayo 20 FL OZ and it came it I have started opening my package and the state of the mayo was just oil with chunks of white s hit that looked like semen I shook the bottle to see a big blob the bottle was unopened still having it's seal didn't expire until September 17 2022 idk what temperature they keep there food in but it's obviously the wrong fuc king temperature to be sending out s hit like that that get the order two hours before delivery time and can't even realize they grabbed and bagged a disgusting looking mayo to be sent out,0
I ordered socks for my husband and I was waiting for the delivery... checked my phone and the delivery said it had been handed to the resident When I  checked it has been left on my  door step... luckily it  had been stolen... nowhere on the site to leave a review so I will not use this  site again.,0
"I bought 3 mini blink cameras just over 11 months ago unfortunately 1 of the cameras stopped working I got in touch with  tech support on line they carefully ran me through what had to be done so they could remotely check the camera .they found it was a fault with the hardware they are sending me a free replacement camera ,there support with this matter was dealt with promptly and professionally ,thank you blink team",2
It has become my go to place for all my shopping. I really am un-happy about the new tracking/targeting system. I feel that they are now charging me more for idem's that I may want. So I am now more careful about what I buy there and shop around more. I use to be a faithful Amazon shopper. Just a ordinary management decision. Amazon has lost 40% of my business because of this. But they have lots of money... :),1
"Delayed order , Classic Amazon smh...",1
It seems my orders are coming from places other than Amazon. I don’t like that these people get my email and spam me.,1
"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping support. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few average and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman support suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1
It's okay but they should add a method to verify the items they send to their customers.,1
"Amazon used to be my go-to for online shopping, but lately, the interaction has been less better. While the goods range is still extensive, the quality of support has declined. no longer stands out as the acceptable support it once was.",1
My favorite site to shop! Love the variety and prices for products I find. Not to mention how quick I get what I order,2
I have never dealt with such a sorry company in my life. Amazon has the most messed up charging practices and shipping practices. Their customer service is horrible when asking for help. They are the most horrible place to order from. I have packages coming from the UK that cost less and got here faster. This is ridiculous. Wish I could leave 0 stars.,0
"Easy to navigate, perfect user experience design, perfect behavioral targeting etc",2
"Bought over $2,000 dollars worth of goods from them this year. Excellent experience, even with the products that weren't so great. Was able to return them without hassle, and was even given full refund without returns by 2 sellers. Delivery is fast and their app is intuitive.",2
"Amazon is always my first port of call as I know that I can always find just what I want. The site is very easy to use - even for a golden oldie like myself. They are the most reliable site i have used, keeping me informed every step of the way.",2
"I had some pretty ordinary online orders before, and of course at last I jumped to Amazon, well the order came pretty quick, in around 5-6 days ( I am talking about international shipping) but the shipping fee is ridiculous! I bought two books and the shipping fee is more expensive than the books! -_-",1
"Amazon is the Best!  I have never had it so easy with Amazon. My experience is that they are always available to work out complaints with its customers. They are very knowledgeable and have great customer service. For instance, my complaint was with the seller. The seller would not satisfy its promise, so Amazon stepped in and fix the problem for me. Now the seller must answer to Amazon and i'm sure Amazon will put them on notice for failure to meet the customer needs. I will always be a Amazon Prime Member.",2
They always stand behind everything I order; and everything I have ordered has been fantastic!,2
If you can't find it on Amazon it probably doesn't exist.,2
Got everything very quickly; however some of the packages where left out in the rain. Still love this company though!,2
"I've written a review for one of the products I've purchased through Amazon. Amazon reviewed my message and didn't post my message, because I was not recommending that seller based on my experience. I was trying to share my genuine experience with what I've faced and didn't use any bad words in my message. Similarly Amazon might have NOT posted messages which gives negative feedback about their customers. Since then I don't trust amazon customer reviews because they hide lot of truth reviews and buyers like me get trapped to one of their seller customer products. And all the products from amazon are China products these days and also expensive with less quality. so I'm trying to share my review in another portal like here so that my message wil get to some people and not get trapped in amazon's bad online marketing strategy.",0
They have the worst customer service ever. Order a pc case on the 28th says over night shipping gets delayed a day. Then I get it and it's broken and they refused to refund it after about 10 people they finally decided since the panels are glass and were broken but the frame is still okay I could get a return. I set it to have it go to my Amazon account so I could repurchase a different case. I got a email saying the item was picked up.  But no money went into my account.  I called them and they said it was going back on my debit card and now couldn't change it since it was already being done with.  I said how Is it my fault you guys put the return wrong after them literally repeating it would go into my Amazon balance but then them not doing.  The lady then proceeded to say it's not our fault you messed up.  I explained why I wanted it on my account and proceeded to make excuses on why they messed up and put it on my card. Then said It would take 14 days to swap the return label so it could go on my account I said never mind DONT change anything I will deal with the 3 days to my card instead.  Then I got a email 5 minutes after the like 15th call that they were going to start the label swap process which would take 14 to 30 days.  I called them back got a lady name Dany who was no help at all and did not listen or understand what I was saying. Then I got a guy who was super good and said the person who sent that email must've been trying to get under my skin. Cause he saw the email saying the relabeling process would start and would be changed to go onto my amazon balance after me telling them never mind leave it. And he said I see that message but it was never changed so whoever sent the email was trying to upset you.  Worst customer service ever now I will not be able to order my new pc case for 3 to 5 more days. 10 days after it being ordered.  They would my offer any compensation for the troubles they caused because my situation did not qualify. Like how does it not quality! They made it nothing but a problem with this whole order.  If I could leave negative stars I would I should have to speak to almost 20 people to get anything done,0
"I was trying to change my default credit card from Amazon Visa to another credit cared. The site would absolutely not do it. I called customer assistance and spent one-plus hours on the phone with an impatient, intolerant rep. going over and over the sites and selections I had already tried. It just would not let me enter an alternative credit card. Tonight, I found an agent who stayed with me and found a circuitous way for me to enter my new credit card. She was an angel; the rest of Amazon is an overbearing monopoly which I suspect just did not want me to use a credit card other than its.",1
Auto-chatbot is really useful to solve the problem. It saves my time.,2
"I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated shipment time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.",1
"The website has all what you need, but they need to work on filtering fake reviews.",2
"Most items I’ve gotten with no hiccups, but there are a few average sellers.  I ordered crossbars for my 2019 Honda passport and received totally the wrong bars from what I purchased on Amazon.  They try to help me deal directly with the seller.  With no assistance at all. I returned the crossbars that they sent me and then they wouldn’t return my money!  They said that what they sent me wasn’t even their goods. I am appalled that Amazon did not help me whatsoever and would not let me post a review about ASG automotive goodss out of Michigan.  They tried to tell me that they didn’t even have that goods in their building. I returned exactly what I got and they try to steal my money. If you’re going to use Amazon you have a 50-50 shot. They are no better than any other e-commerce business. I may be just one customer but they are probably going to lose me soon",1
ZUMZEE was advertising 3x Febreze plug in Air Fresheners for £13.99. I purchased 2 packs total £27.98. Very quick delivery. They looked like previous Febreze plug in packs. However they are very poor quality and hardly any perfume from them. Possibly they are like scented water. I will not buy any more.,0
"Amazon is the best place to shop online. Period. Customer service goes way beyond anything you'd expect from a normal company. They are not ""normal"" in any sense of the word. They're amazing!",2
"I am one that is, you could say, paranoid. I order everything from Cat food to allergy meds and even more on Amazon. I love the fact that it only takes a day or two to get to me and I don't have to go out and get into the stores and everything.  As a Stroke Survivor I am susceptible to many things and I have little to no immune system. Thank you Amazon for being there during this time and every other, for individuals like myself and my parents who are sheltering at home to keep safe in these times.",2
"They listen, understand and truly try to help. Great workers!",2
"I am writing this only because I feel it needs to be said.  Amazon, I understand with Covid-19 shipments are delayed in shipping; however, please changed your page setting to not say ""if you order in 3 hrs and 15 min"" you have have your order the next day.  I am a prime member and pay my prime membership; however, I do base my orders on when I can receive them.  Telling people if you order in so many hours you can have your shipment by .... if is misleading and plain wrong.",1
"Horrible service! It has taken 7 days waiting for a refund and not nothing yet, when I contacted them, I was informed that the cancellation had not been processed and it will take another 7 to 10 days. This purchase  was done using the EBT card for an elderly person who needs the money to be able to purchase her food. BAD service and irresponsible Will NOT use their services again",0
Terrible customer service! Ordered some supplements and selected overnight delivery 4am to 8am. Well 8am comes and no package so I use their chat to find out where it is. The agent (sohail) was very rude and told me he would use “simple words” to explain that it may take 2-3 days even though item showed available and would be delivered overnight. As you can imagine my response was slightly colorful at which point he disconnected the chat. Well I had to call and they refunded my money but I’m still SOL on my supplements! Great way to treat your prime customers Amazon!,0
"There is literally no customer support here, you pay for ‘prime’, order a ‘prime’ item. They take your ‘prime’ payment and then don’t deliver according to the ‘prime’ order timescales- WHAT’S THE POINT????! I may aswell go Argos for the same price and save myself the head ache of speaking to these half wits and save myself £7.99 a month for NOTHING! Literally thanks for nothing Amazon.Update 11/09/2022, Amazon have given I £5 credit on my account for the inconvenience which goes some way towards building my confidence and trust for the company.",1
"Amazon Customer Service Is Very Bad & Totally Sucks . !!I ordered 2 items and they show being paid on my credit card but not on my amazon account . DHL tried to deliver to the wrong address and returned the packages a day later. Tried to check my account with Amazon and no record of purchase ,so tried to contact Amazon but  just got sent from one stupid link to another and got the run around. Tried to contact their chat service and it said not available . Surprised they are so successful with such crappy service and support. Only option left is to cancel the payments with the credit card company since Amazon do their sellers a disservice by having terrible support which costs the sellers money in lost sales like mine .",0
"Never, ever use Amazon Payments! Sure it works as a payment form, but when you have trouble getting your money back on a subscription that was already cancelled, Amazon customer service is non-existing. Have spend the last 3 days trying to get help from Amazon customer service, and it is quite clear, that despite numerous mails from their side regarding ""our customer is important"", they have no intention of helping me with a mistake that they made... Very disappointing and the last time that I will use their Payments.",0
Excellent overall service in particular customer service.,2
"Cool! It's awesome place for sellers and for buyers, much more wider then other platforms! Provide more opportunities for entrepreneurs",2

"Great Service as always, get my dvds on time everytime...",2
Sick to death of Amazon drivers not shutting gate I have copd and can’t get down there it’s not all of them but had order today gate now left open 😡😡😡😡,1
I paid for an item and never received it. Amazon have not customer support option and only offer a return item option. Seller sent a pre scripted email and didn't bother to try to resolve the issue either. Amazon and the dodgy seller wiped their hands clean of the issue but happily kept my money. This is what i would consider an online scam. They only get away with it because their name is AMAZON.Update---------Amazon did eventually refund me for this item. The fault was with Royal Mail. They falsely claimed they delivered a parcel. I have a camera in front of my door. They lied.,1
"Don't like that they try to sneak in ways to get you to subscribe to Amazon prime,  Super annoying. Just let me order without that nonsense",0
Ordered an item. No item delivered. Contacted customer services. Told replacement coming. No item delivered. Contacted Amazon again. Item no longer available. Tried to contact customer services to complain and the mobile app message read as follows;We can't find the page you were trying to view. We apologise for the inconvenience.Amazon. Now you get a review here.,0

"I have nothing bad to say about Amazon.com.  I have a prime membership which means that for about $80/year, I and 4-5 other family members have free 2-day shipping for an entire year.  You can see that if you divide that fee between everyone, that it becomes quite reasonable.  I have a Kindle, and I absolutely love it - I no longer have to find more bookshelving for my expanding library.  Amazon is a real winner!!!",2
Love their delivery system. They Always deliver as promised.,2

"Should be zero stars. Delivery people don't even do the bare minimum of knocking or ringing the doorbell, just leaving packages in plain sight to be stolen. Every once in a while it feels necessary to use them but it is really not worth the risk.",0
"An Amazon company is very well trusted and a big company in the world. Has no competitive in trust and several customers in the world. Its supply of goods, food and clothes items are very diversified at affordable price.Are timely, and their agents are critical.

I recently purchased wall posters from Amazon. Good price and stuff got delivered in 3 days. Great website to buy almost anything.,2

Nice website.Easy return and acceptable customer care.,1
Great selection of items and professional shipment. However the website is over complicated and it is confusing and miss leading when it comes to cancelling prime. They know they have us wrapped around their finger and they abuse this power in my opinion.,1
I have been shopping at Amazon for a while now and they're so great they have good prices I have never had no problem I have never had nothing back and I will shop there in the future thank you and have a great day,2
"No support,just change my number and no access to my account.Call them 8 times and they can’t help me.I thing they don’t care.",0
"its a great place to buy, just be carefull choosing the seller.",2
"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2
"I am a blogger who writes about company reviews on any company I come across to. I am sure some of you will agree with me on this. I know someone who is a driver, and they better be treated respectfully.It is important to look around at other stores. I look at prices too. Online is a bigger issue with dealing with scams. Be careful where you shop online. Amazon is one of them.I was ranting while I was walking back from a store. I saw an Amazon truck. There seems to be a lot more nowadays. But this specific truck looked old, not the ones I usually see. I was curious of where this truck came from. Do drivers have to clean the truck themselves?. I feel bad for those drivers. I was really annoyed, no bathroom breaks?!. The warehouse employees are fired at the year 3 of how long they have been working. The company has stated that after three years, the employees are 'lazy'. They pay you to leave. Instead of fixing the speed of shipping, why not fix the employee situation?. These are human beings. Even the ones with color do not get treated fairly. Even though Amazon has a 'black lives matter' thing on their website or advertisements, it is lie.I say to myself, it is not just with the people you see at a store, to me, it is about the whole company, is the CEO willing to change something’s about their company. I hope the employees are striking for more respect, who does the harder work?, the employees. I still have not used the app. I am glad. I feel for those employees with the holiday season coming up.",0
They don’t allow true reviews to be posted. If you had a bad experience they shut down your review. It’s pathetic that such a large corporation refuses to allow honest reviews.,0
"None existent customer service, inept delivery drivers (good luck getting anything delivered on the day they claim.) Prime account cancelled, Section 75 claim submitted for missing deliveries.",0
great policy and return protection,2
I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer support levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the support on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
"It's a great assistance.. however, since I never know if I'm actually going to get what I paid for due to theft risk and order gamble. It would be nice to not have ""package delivered"" show on your order until it was actually delivered. It would also be nice if the drivers actually took packages to your door.",1
"Nice items, great quality. Don't like order time.",1
"Amazon never fails! I’ve had numerous things ordered since this lockdown and can genuinely say Amazon have been outstanding during this pandemic, ensuring no matter the circumstances they still keep a quality service!",2
"Why try to deliver late at night? We are in a business park that has a security gate. I've noted this in the delivery instructions FOR YEARS, yet you still insist on delivering late at night? Items that are listed as next day delivery take a full week or more. I will stop using Amazon and go back to buying my products at a real store.",0
"BEWARE BEWARE, I’ve been using Amazon for a few years and I’m about to cancel my membership due to never receiving the items I order online. They constantly send my deliveries to the wrong address and when you call to tell them about it, they don’t seem to care. I guess they than got filthy rich and don’t care about the customers anymore.",0
I have ordered books and other gadgets from Amazon for almost two years.The goods are always fine with acceptable packaging.The shipment is not so fast the only thing that bothers me,1
"Amazon is definitely one of my favorite online shopping sites besides of course, ebay. However, I prefer amazon more. The reason being is, Amazon does not scam. I can give 100% trust in the service & the seller. Although sometimes, apparently, it does not carry what I wanted therefore I have to switch to ebay. But overall, I'd always pick Amazon because it has never failed me! :)",2
"An Amazon driver was driving recklessly on our neighborhood street and nearly ran into 4 school age school age girls on their scooters. I told the driver he needed to be more careful. With that he started yelling at me and physically attacked me. I complained to Amazon who told me they would fill out a ""driver feed back form"". They did not want to know where, when or a description of the driver. After this I received an email from Amazon asking me if the representative was able to solve the delivery problem! What a great example of a giant corporation not caring.Update: Jan 10, 2021. Amazon has NEVER contacted me about this.",0
Very well written the format was great the footnotes were helpful decent reading material I felt the sadness and joy,1
"Prices are very high, buyers are hardly ever protected, especially international customers using freight company address for shipping-just like me. Amazon allows drop shipper sellers who are not aware what they are dispatching. If your item is not as described you are experiencing monetary loss. Regarding customer assistance: it used to be very decent back in the years but now most of them are sleepy and I even have a feeling that they did not understand English and they are using some online dictionary to see what you wrote, frequently they provide with irrelevant answers. Not all of them but most do. Amazon VS eBay-better buy on eBay, eBay has unbeatable prices at least.",1
"Ordered a rollator for my mum, the listing was for multiple colours and sizes. Order said extra small from drop down box but received a small. Waited in twice now for collection from Evri who have twice refused to collect as to large. Amazon customer service this time has been appalling. Not confident to order another one as listings all mixed up and still not sorted. Customer service actually told me to order from an another seller instead of Amazon. Currently on phone to customer services 45 minutes on hold. ",0
Pretty reliable but prefer boutique shopping.,1
I live in a rural area but I can order all the things I need and get it delivered in a timely fashion. Thanks Amazon!,2
"Amazon has great prices, and there is no end to what you will find to fit your needs, however, I cannot always trust the sellers. Amazon leaves it up to the customer to research their sellers to find out if they are legitimate and follow fine business practices. They also do a terrible job with packaging their orders. I received an order of 3 reams of copy paper that was put in this giant box that would be suited for a huge picture frame. The reams of paper slid all around inside and the item packing was all tore up. The paper was a mess! Amazon packaging is also very wasteful. I once received 3 little packs of Name averagege stickers in a box a little bigger than a shoebox! For a company that makes the billions it does, you think they could afford to research, review, and oversee the quality and legitimacy of their sellers in real time.",1
"Christmas is currently ruined because of Amazon.  I had expected 3 packages today from Amazon.  When they hadn't arrived by 8pm I checked online, only to discover that they had been delivered and signed for by a completely different person in an entirely different location.  I then spent 2 hours trying to find out where my packages had been sent to.  Amazon couldn't contact the driver to re-deliver which is ridiculous!!!  I am so upset by the whole incident that I will no longer be using Amazon.",0
"You shop on Amazon.  You find what you want.  One of the reasons you shop here is because of their shipping.  You place your order because Amazon promises your package will be delivered on a certain day.  Then you wait because your package doesn't come.  After they take your money and send you a confirmation telling you when you will get it, you don't get it, and you get an email saying sorry it's late, and if you don't get it by this day, you can have your money back.",1
"Amazon has earned my trust across hundreds of orders over many years. When something went wrong, they have always refunded my money, no questions asked. I'm grateful for the hassle-free experience!",2
"Wasn't the greatest support I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
"I order a lot on amazon. They usually ask for comments on goodss. I did a lot of comments on the goodss that I purchsed. I suddenly realised that I canot add comments on the quality os some that I recived and had to return them. I recall 3 times that I left comments amd truly said but Amazon send me a espouse that it canot be published. I wondered at the time of Amazon was trying to protect customers or the businesses that are selling on Amazon. Customers are allowed to leave comments that are honest and true, but Amazon filtering stops negative ones and this is not protecting the customers rights but businesses. If we the customers stop buying from Amazon, where would Amazon be.",1
Have been purchasing from Amazon for years I've bought many wonderful products. I'll always give 5 star reviews made one negative review about a bogus product was absolutely misrepresented.. Now Amazon has removed all of my reviews throughout the history of my purchases and I am no longer allowed to review any products. How. How is the customer supposed to make an educated choice on a product if the negative reviews are removed,0
"delivery drivers do not follow simple instructions,  some have damaged my property ,   customer service is awfull",0
"1 about delivery: lately all Amazon packages arrive damaged, some of the products arrive damaged because of poor packaging and handling.2- Amazon treat their costumes poorly, and most of the problems unsolved.3- I have been with Amazon for more than 15 years, and I am an Amazon prime member, and an honest reviewer, and whole food shopper, I have been building a good account through these years, then suddenly Amazon whipped out my account And deleted about 130 of my old reviews, it like no one is matter to them, they do whatever they feel like it, and there is no account is secure is with Amazon. I called customer service and to see what is going on and he said he escalated the issue, next day the whipped out the rest and my account went back to zero, I guess that was their best solution to the problem, whipped out everything, then costumers should start from zero. after 15 years of building your reputation you don’t matter to them.I used to think Amazon is a great place to shop, secure, and save and, but now I am moving my business somewhere else, I am returning everything I bought during the lock down, because I was only shopping Amazon during this time, assuming the are the best, but actually they are the worst.",0
"I’m just gonna give this an average. I mean like, the customer assistance is acceptable and that but when I order things, it sometimes wouldn’t come to my door which is kinda a problem. But it’s still a acceptable company! Don’t ditch it!",1
Amazon are excellent on prices and goods. Quick delivery and I was kept up to date with details of delivery by e-mail.,2
I used amazon in my small business I love all their big discount and coupon.. More Power!!!,2
This is a review based on their drivers. They don’t care where they leave parcels so long as they can get them out of their van and off their list. They rely on neighbours being neighbourly to get package to the right house. The couriers lie and say they’ve handed it physically to customer when they’ve left it outside someone else’s house.  I’m sure this doesn’t stop people using the giant for online shopping but honestly their platform is hard to leave a complaint so this is how I’m doing it. Clean up your act Amazon logistics. Find a way off stopping your drivers from lying to you and use What3words. It’s there and is very useful in an effort to get things to the right doorstep.,0
why life is acceptable at amazon?,1
"I've been a subscriber for the last 10 years, and for the fee, I get Premium TV/Movies, Streaming Music, and free shipping, and expedited service on my orders. I don't want to leave the house anymore than I have to, and Amazon is my store for everything. Plus, they allow small businesses to put their products on the site. Most folks just want to complain about ""big businesses"", but I have gratitude for Amazon, and Apple for making my life easier.",2
"What Amazon has done to me and my grandson is disgusting. My grandson asked me for something for Christmas. I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it. Being 65 it's better I buy online then visit stores during Covid19. I received emails from Amazon 1.) on Dec 1st, order confirmation. 2.) on Dec 7th, my item has shipped and I should expect it by Dec 8th. After a few days waiting for item to arrive I started contacting Amazon. From one customer service (CS) rep to another rep, then supposedly one cs team leader to another cs team leader, I got the same answer they don't know what happened to my grandson's Christmas gift. They kept telling me that they can no longer give me my item I payed for and was told I would receive it proof of emails received by Amazon. I tried all over the web to find Amazon's Executive contact information. I called the executive office's where they would not give me any executive to talk to about my problem. I sent emails to a few executives but no answer as of yet, jeff at amazon being one of them. The only thing I can see is that when I purchased my item on Dec 1st it was selling for $129.99, now it up to $400.00. They must have seized my item to make more money selling it to someone else. How much more money does Jeff Bezos and Amazon want to make? So beware when Amazon screws you no one will help you.",0
Never had a problem with Amazon,2
"Great service,no problems.Cheers",2
"Don't get me wrong. I like you guys, but your website look outdated. Sometimes it's so hard to find information I'm looking for.",1
"Tsop notch support and outssstanding customer support, they treated me VERY wwell evesn though i'm quite unusaged within this field. All in all, 5 out of 5!",1
"It seems as though you can’t be honest with Amazon anymore. Recently I made a purchase for a phone. I couldn’t find the phone after delivery. I made a claim and they denied it. How can you just leave an expensive phone lying around out side, smh. I was about to resubmit when the package showed up. There  are still good people around living at the Apartment complex.The package also said charger included. There wasn’t a charger, very misleading information for $1065+. I sent a review and Amazon said it couldn’t be submitted. Because my focus was on seller and packaging. Are they for real?",0

Happy though still some problems in it. Nowadays make delay for item order,1
"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day order was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the goods.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day order is bs.  I’ve had several two-day order packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the order would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day order mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the goodss sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1
I really love Amazon.Very efficient service.Huge variety of products.As a buyer all my purchases came at good prices and very fast sometimes even up to the house.(Without going to the post office)About Amazon salesI never sold there.But I heard a good friend of mine selling there.That the warehouse service is excellentAnd everything you store there in warehouses you get e-mail while it is sold.Which is a very convenient service.Regarding the Company's shares and the rate of growth.I bought the stock in the 900 and sold in the 1600 area.At its peak it reached $ 2000 per unit.I really think all the work for Jeff BezosAbout what he managed to create.RegardsAlon Fertig,2
prices very acceptable shame some items come not very well packed and have to go back replacement and refund policy very acceptable shame i have to use it often,1
"My usage is purely based on the website and processes, but overall amazon with get a 3/5.Purely because a lot of items are the site can 3rd party and made with cheap material while sellers sell items at a high price.However amazon do plenty of offers on normal everyday items and I've not had much issue when contacting them if I have problems.My only gripe would be that sometimes some items are sent out via other couriers such as Evri, DPD, Royal Mail etc, and I wish they would state on the order on the website that this chosen courier is delivering my parcel instead of an amazon courier.",1
"I ordered two of the exact same sweatshirts from Amazon 2 weeks ago. The only thing different was the color. One of them arrived within four to five days. The other one never arrived although I kept checking the shipment status. I finally got a notification that it was undeliverable as addressed and it was sent to another address. Seriously? It was from the same order, same address, same everything.  How could one get there with no problem and the other one couldn't find its way to my home....so they just sent it back to the ""third party shipper""?  My account was credited, but I question how one part of my order arrived with no problem but for the other part of the order they couldn't find me?",1
"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of interactions with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only decent thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1
"I recently ordered some things from Amazon and I didn't realize my account was short and they charged another card in my wallet and came within 1.59 of bouncing my rent check. This would not have been necessary if I had been contacted before it would have been paid for by another source, but I wasn't contacted prior to their going ahead with this. I've had a rough year, been in the hospital 3 times and the second time had my right leg amputated below the knee. Bought all the hardware from Amazon. Wheelchair, walker, house ramp and then a second walker. These people need to realize we are people too. I'm very disappointed in Amazon at the moment. The worst part is they don't even seem to care.",0
"The last person i spoke with was very rude, and was basically telling me that it's my fault that my order was delivered messed up. I ordered the shorts needing them for an event tomorrow, but they were delivered today ripped. So, now not only do i have to go out spend more money to buy more, and even told her i didn't want or need the refund that i still want the shorts only to be told that a replacement was unavailable and that i need to send in the shorts and wait for them to be received processed before i can be refunded, so i simply asked are you kidding me then she wants to get an attitude saying no she isn't kidding and that it can take 30 days or more to get them processed for a refund i still even asked if there was any way possible for me to get my refund into my Ammazon gift card balance so that i could order another pair to which she was again rude as hell saying no i had to not only wait the 30 plus days for the refund to be issued but i have to wait another 10 days for it to go back to my card. So, satisfied sadly after this refund is processed i will no longer bee ordering anything from Amazon again, and i took screen shots of the conversation and how rude this person was and i will be on every platform i can find leaving reviews about this. So, not only did Amazon lose me as a customer today but they also lost everyone of my family members and friends that use Amazon. We will be ordering from TikTok shop and ebay from now on. TikTok shop usually has better prices and neither one of them have ever been rude like this to me before and never have i ever had something delivered to me ripped up and i get blamed basically for it and get told I'm basically screwed on getting my money back for a month and a half. I have only had one package come messed up from another place and i contacted customer support and they gave me a choice of getting refunded or i could have the same thing i ordered mailed out that day, to wait on my money for a month and a half is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable especially when it's either Amazon's fault or the delivery company THEY USED to have my order delivered. I guess you guys at Amazon forget that us customers are the ones that keep you employed and for you to treat your customers that spend alot of money with you the way you treated me is beyond crazy. But hey losing around 10-15 prime customers in one day is no sweat for y'all even though one single person is the one that made these 10-15 prime customers leave. So, congrats Amazon keep it up and I'm sure you'll be losing alot more. Hope you enjoy this terrible review on every platform i find showing everyone how you treat people.",0

"Amazon prime continues to disappoint. 2 day order no longer exists and movies suck big time. Haven't ran across a movie I want to watch that's  ""free"" in ages. The decent titles have to be rented again on top of the price already paid for Amazon prime. Amazon prime itself is just a gimmick to make sure people use a prime seller to get free not so free order. We are stupid.",1
Customer service is horrible. I made a purchase for my granddaughters birthday. The package was delivered to my house instead of my granddaughters.

I asked for a FAIR credit on my account and your management, LEXI, refused AND she also wouldn't give me her boss's name (she said it was against policy).

I pay for amazon prime and as always my package arrived the very next day, which was very useful because I needed the art supplies and textbook for school the next day. it was delivered early in the day so I did not have to wait inside for the whole day. my items were all in the same cardboard package which is good because it is saving paper so good for then environment. overall I was very pleased with this delivery and I will be spreading the word of my positive experience.",2

It may have gone to an old email address and I have been on the chat line trying to register my current email address.

"Update, after a day of back and forth plus a trustpilot review I finally got a comprehensive answer and I am now have all the info and reasons why I cannot post my goods review.  Maybe an explanation in the first place would have helped.                                                    I have written a review for an item I purchased. I was sent an email to say it was rejected. Fair enough. Why it was rejected is not noted so I looked at the guidelines and popped back on to right a review within these guidelines. Not allowed. Barred for writing a review because I really like something? Emailed the address given by Amazon for any questions regarding this. Reply states they cant find the review. Yes that would be correct Amazon- as you rejected it, the review wont be there. I replied and got another email stating I had emailed the wrong place and was given guidelines on how to report dodgy reviews. I have emailed again asking for someone to actually read my first email and let me review the item I purchased. Round and round we go, Will update if I ever get and answer to my initial request.......",1

"Minus 5 🌟 to the guy who was pretending to be a delivery person Just had a parcel delivered from AMAZON. Had a text reminder saying it’s been delivered, yes it was but not in the safe place, I always get it delivered to which is in the porch at the bottom of the garden. Where was it delivered to? In the grass just inside the gate.I went up and caught the guy before he got in his van and I asked him why he didn’t knock on the door his ignorant answer was I didn’t want to disturb you. I asked if he thought that was funny he said whatever, I told the ignorant guy I’m reporting him he said whatever feel free. So is this the type of person AMAZON employ? No wonder they have a bad name. But do they care? Not while they are making billions in profits ",0
Amazon is the best app you will ever find to buy stuff its honestly the best,2
Products are overall pretty decent. But order is horrible. So many things have not been delivered on time. UPS delivered way better than Uber or prime order trucks. Very frustrating.,1
Fantastic range of goods at great prices,2
Amazon has been around since my college days. That’s when only students could use prime. I have a love hate relationship with them. Yes I know they f’ up but they also fix the issue too. I have no complaints specifically that I can even think of.,1
I gave 4 stars because the majority of drivers are kind and helpful deserving  5 stars but 2% let the the other drivers and the company down when it  comes to the elderly we seem to speak another language they don’t understand us when one off these drivers came yesterday afternoon with order number 204-5796960-3400326 he rang the door entry bell I said bring it up please the address is first floor flat and he translates into leave it downstairs he even had a invisible receptionist sign for it because I certainly didn’t ,2

I am surprised to see so many people that have had such bad experiences with amazon. I have never had any issues when returning items or with customer service,2
amazon is a acceptable platform for B2b bussines.,1
"I've routinely used Amazon for little over a couple of years now & ebay for over 17 years.Amazon customer service is better than what ebay used to provide it's premium members (but no longer provide).I cannot believe it, but I have been able to speak with Customer services (real person) all hours - even at 4am & for then to holistically evaluate & provide swift resolution on the phone.Another advantage is that Amazon have oversight & control of delivery of the item, they are accountable and reliable unlike ebay where sellers may use some crap delivery service like Evri/Hermes, which often deliver to the wrong address & having to wait weeks for a replacement/refund. Amazon prime's delivery service is often free, but crucially fast - very fast! Often next day, regardless whether it's a weekday or weekend - simply unparalleled.Amazon are definitely going to (and in fact are) overtaking ebay.Gia Hy",2

For a long time Amazon was number one with me. I have been a prime member for years. Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer support has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,1
"For me the advantages favour me to shop here but the place is far from perfect. The customer support, when an issue arises is low rate. You will be speaking to staff from India and they have know idea how to address a normal conversation which makes the entire usage an absolute waste of time. Away from that most of it is beneficial. Being in the City Centre Amazon performs well. Although the live tracking sucks. In 2022 you know customer support is almost non existence and everything is heading in a way to become less interactive with humans. But it’s probably the better support compared to the rest that’s out there. It’s classic consumerism consuming us. Spend with care, it will always get worst not better.",1
"Bought a new book and received a used one with underlines all over the book. Contacted Amazon five times, were promised Courier would pick up the book, but none did. The worst ever liar/thief I encountered. Never buy from Amazon again!!!",0
... but overall one of my favorite online shops. I guess there is not much you cannot get there.,2
"Ordered hangers for the apartment, they weren't delivered cause my address was ""undeliverable"" which never happened to me before!",1
"Since i live in Berlin, next day shipment is not a promise anymore.Just judging on the ecommerce interaction Amazon ist best-in-class.Judging amazon as a cooperation... well...",1
Never had any problems with amazon. Use them a lot. Love the click and buy!,2
Always like using amazon but waste of packaging for little items. Not very acceptable. Service is great though,1
Very well written the format was great the footnotes were helpful fine reading material I felt the sadness and joy,1
"MOST of the time Amazon is great, gets packages to me quickly with prime and has decent items. But lately I’ve been noticing something is off with the reviews! I was looking at reviews for a item and noticed there are reviews for a completely different item, which could give the impression that this item has 5 stars but really it’s from ratings from another item. Don’t know if this is a mistake or scheming but it makes me trust Amazon a lot less..",1
I turn to Amazon for all my gift giving and hard to find shopping!  They are loyal and easy for refunds.  ,2
My prime subscription has been cancelled for 3 months and every month the bank charge keeps coming up. The consultants at customer care keep redirecting me to different places but I can't seem to stop the transaction. Canceling an account is the biggest rigmarole and there just doesn't seem to be a solution. I keep being redirected and it feels like it is set up in such a difficult way so that it makes it exhausting for you and eventually you just give up. But at the same time I don't even have access to the account anymore. What a mess.,0
"2 major gripes.1. I have Prime but when i put a goods in my cart the order date always changes,obviously a few days after that stated on the goods page. 2 They should have told me before i returned Everything that you're supposed to keep the charger and accessories.now i have a lonesome Echo Dot and ha ve to buy a charger separatel ly.",1
"Guaranteed delivery by 10pm. Get a notification at 7.20pm saying my item won't be coming tonight. The item was incredibly important hence same-day delivery yet Amazon couldn't care less. Amazon call themselves the World's most customer-centric company, yet honestly don't care. The compensation they offered me was an absolute insult too. Less than an hour's wage.",0
there shipping is to high on some of there stuff,1
"Honestly one of the best companies in the world. Sure all the reviewers here seem to have one issue or the other, but from my person experience (7 years of purchases) Amazon has always kept a smile on my face like their A to Z policy promotes. Don't forget that alot of these reviews come from fraudsters who want to get stuff for free. ",2
"The blame isn’t on Amazon because the delivery driver did his job. The Amazon driver took a photo of my pkg sitting at my door,,this driver really took the time to do his job and he provided proof that my pkg was delivered. The only problem was that, this company logo named ,( Feelin Girl) shipped me an undersized undergarment that was “kid-sized”and 10 sizes too small and It wasn’t even the size that I ordered. I need to return this Item for a refund soon.",2
Getting Amazon Prime was a horrible decision! I have had so many shipping problems I can't even count them. I recently ordered some tattoo supplies. I am flying to NY tomorrow. I ordered the stuff on Tues and picked free 2 day shipping. As of Thursday my stuff has still not shipped. I now have to order from another company and pay a huge overnight fee. Definitely not woth the $100+ a year. It seems the bigger they get the less they care. Everything that made them a great company is slipping away,0
"I use amazon.com for nearly all my online shopping! Even if I can't find everything I'm looking for directly on the site, it is a great starting point.",2
"So all the things I could possible need for my new puppies, they have!Well worth the price, Pime is a bargain I think.Thank you.",2
Good deals prices are fair customer assistances are fine sometimes stuff is late but it's okay have great deals aswell,1
"HORRIBLE service! Never got two of the items I had ordered on 4/5 that was supposed to be here by the next day 4/6. By 4/12 I had contacted them TWICE asking what's going on after I had gotten a notice that the delivery had been CANCELED as I did NOT cancel the order. The 1st time I contacted them and asked them why the order had been canceled they claimed the order was NOT canceled and that I should get it soon (LMAO YEAH RIGHT). even though my tracking link said otherwise that my order was being sent back to amazon as they had canceled it. 5 DAYS LATER STILL NO DELIVERY. Such a waste of time and they are such CROOKS! Just want your money and think you will forget about it! TOTAL SCAM! I don't see how Amazon is allowed to stay in business with such SHADY business practices. They finally gave me a refund after telling me the order WAS CANCELED like I had told them it was originally, so I could reorder, and they had also told me they would refund me a month's payment of PRIME for my trouble and all the TIME I wasted since the product did NOT come in a timely manner as it did not even come at ALL! Now I am STILL waiting for my refund for THAT. I'm sure I will have to contact them AGAIN about that to get my refund for my membership. Will be canceling membership ASAP as they have gone downhill and cannot support such a crappy business who does NOT EVEN HONOR THEIR OWN PROMISES AND DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. JUST GROSS!  Customers should NOT have to keep at a company over and over again to ensure that the company does WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. Would give ZERO stars if I could!! :/",0

"I have bought a lot of items from Amazon, over the last couple of years, and I have only had to return 1 item. This is very good in my opinion and I am a happy customer",2
love using amazon. we got rid of prime but still order all the time. decent.,2
Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
ive had on the whole a very pleasant usage with amazon. I have recommended it to friends,1
"Hello! We use amazon A LOT, but recently have had a few issues. Our last amazon driver stole our package in broad day light... Thankfully you guys are awesome and replaced for free but I still want it to be known your St. Peter’s,MO driver is a thief. I have pics but not sure where to post them...",2
I have had an Amazon account for years. Now all of a sudden when I try to place an order they send me a notice that there is suspicious activity on my account and shut everything down. I have been double charged for an order I have not received and other orders cancelled. My order history has been deleted. I have spent hours over several days trying to get my account straightened out. Now I am going to delete my account and take my business elsewhere.,0

I never had any bad experiences with amazon. You can find almost anything on their website and it will be shipped to you in excellent condition.,2
The item was way smaller than described/expected.,1
"Amazon's Customer service is useless and their policies are amazingly stupid. I placed an order on 10/27/20 that had a ONE-Day shipping guarantee with a delivery the following day after shipment. Well 2 days later on 10/29/20 after waiting all day and getting a message that the package was on the way and would arrive between 1:45 pm to 5:45 pm I received a later message saying the package was delayed and now they would be sending the items in two separate delievries on 10/30 and 10/31. This was not the guarantee on their website nor is it the 2 day shipping I pay for as a Prime Member. Needless to say I was a bit upset as this is not the only time this has happened and so I cancelled the order fully expecting to be credited back my money straight away, fast forward to today 11/3/20 and I still have not received a refund and to make matters worse I'm being told by Amazon customer service that I need to wait for the items to ship back to the warehouse before they even begin to process the refund. What?,Why? The package never left Amazon's chain of custody since it was being delivered by their carriers, so how is it that I have to wait for it to get back to the warehouse when they should be able to scan the items as a return right there and begin the refund process? I have sent returns before through UPS, FedEx and the regular mail and the second the package is scanned the refund process begins immediately, but somehow even though Amazon's carriers are in possession of the package they refuse to begin process of the refund until the package physically reaches their warehouse and I have to wait X amount of days with no way to track the progression of the items to get my money back....this is NOT okay, Amazon!! What happens if the items never make it to your warehouse even though your carriers where the last ones holding the package? Do I not get my money back because your employees left my package in the back of their truck and forgot to make the return? This is why I think their return policy regarding cancellations is a confusing mess. They should have a way to track the eta of items being returned to their warehouses and should not penalize the customer and make them wait for a refund if the carriers were Amazon drivers in the first place. This is just not a good way of doing business and feels like they are actually trying to steal money from their customers with this insane policy. (again, they have the package already...it's just not in the warehouse)In the beginning Amazon was great but it has started to slowly go downhill in quality of goods sold through and fulfilled by them and quality of their service through deliveries and customer service. After this last wake up call I will no longer be returning as a member and will be taking my online shopping business elsewhere. I'm sure this won't matter to them but it matters to me to do business with a company that cares for it's customers. GoodBye Amazon, and If I don't receive my refund I will be filing a complaint with the ftc or bbb.",0
"I have to say, one of the few companies to truly impress. Not without the occasional issue but with a company of such sheer volume this is to be expected. The difference is, they do make a very genuine effort to solve fix and resolve.Good Job Mr Books",2
"Overall 5 Stars for Amazon…I love the convenience! But this packaging, I give three stars bc I question the waste from the shipping dept. And it’s happened before. Why do they package 2 very small items in a huge box with 4 ft of air pockets?  What a waste!",1
"I have been an Amazon customer for many years and also as a Prime customer. The main reason is because of their normally excellent returns policy. I've just started a return for an item within the returns timeline only to have to jump through hoops and several arguments to get them to accept the return.Now the main reason for me to buy from Amazon has been destroyed. Someone needs to change this policy of belligerence. However it won't be me, I'm going to buy from elsewhere. The replacement for this product, is twice the price of the return, but I've placed an order with another retailer now.",0
"Top notch assistance and outstanding customer support, they treated me VERY well even though i'm quite uninteractiond within this field. All in all, 5 out of 5!",1
"I don't know if the issue I'm having is too complicated for Amazon representatives or if Amazon decided not to be helpful anymore (it seems like Amazon's new policy is ""we're insanely big so we don't care about our customers anymore..."") but I've been having issues with Amazon Chat representatives attitude in the last 3 months.I received no help, extremely unfriendly service and felt like no one is willing to help!!! it really felt like Amazon doesn't care if I'm going to stay a loyal customer or not.I don't know if anyone with ability to do anything is going to read this but this is the main reason why I'm not going to make any additional purchases on Amazon and will not renew my membership as well as stop using my Amazon store Card.I truly hope someone who cares will read this and be able to do something. Until then, I'm not going to shop on Amazon or use any of Amazon additional services...",0
"Seriously, the first place I look when buying stuff online from vitamins to computer equipment.",2
I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.,2
Job to worker ,2
"2nd time in as many months, that a driver leaked a significant amount of oil on the driveway. Poorly trained drivers with little common sense. Amazon needs to make an effort to educate its drivers. Last time, 4 in the morning waking the household up with very loud exhaust and came back twice due to being confused.",0
"I have ordered several items from Amazon, each time the doorbell has rung but when I open the door no one is there and my package has been left on the doorstep!!!! Not happy as it wouldn't matter if it was a  ' T-shirt' or food to leave ANYTHING on a doorstep is reprehensible.",0
Poor company stopped me doing reviews on products with no reason why and expect them to use no way enjoy,0
Amazon are great when it goes to plan.  When they don't they are a complete pile of *hit with zero customer service.  I always look elsewhere now rather than deal with this God awful bunch.,0
Great service. Received order on time as promised!,2
"I always find what I am looking for, only disappointment is when purchase comes from outside seller rather than themselves - they can be very slow to receive in the latter's case.",2

All of Amazon's reviews are fake. 95% of the products come from China and are toxic. Items never get delivered on the dates shown upon purchase. Customer service is nothing but rude people from India. This is the worst subscription service I've ever had. Amazon is the wealthiest company on the face of the earth and this is the best they can do. How pathetic! ,0
"They make political stances thinking they know what best for my interests. They can't seem to get my delivery days correct, I know people who work for Amazon and they get treated like crap. They treat their deliver service providers like crap. I know a few. I don't think they realize that they are customers as well. But they wouldn't care anyways. When you have an issue, there's nobody who cares to help you.",0
I think Amazon could take a leaf out of Ebays ebook when it comes to navigation/listing/cataloging etc. It's irritating to browse.,1
"Honestly, I love Amazon in that it's convenient, and shipping is amazing. Pricing is often not particularly competitive; but it's just so easy. On the downside, I don't like supporting a company that routinely decides to censor books that don't conform to their Woke guidelines. I know it's perfectly legal because they're a private company, I just don't want to pay for it. So, I'm averaging out to 3-stars.",1
Awful. Have spent tens of thousands with these clowns over the years and lately they do not care one bit about anybody. They don’t connect calls or bother calling you when you have issues they just randomly cancel your orders and don’t bother to deliver. My girlfriend caught an Amazon driver urinating in my garden last year and when told to stop he said he had nowhere else to go whilst holding it in has hand. Absolute joke of a company. And they really don’t care if they upset you as long as they take your hard earned money. You have been warned. Useless and way to big for their boots.,0
Terrible service Amazon fresh store code didn't work called assistance when they answered was transferred 7 times and left on hold for about an hour total call time was 1 hour 40 mins in total then was told that they could seem to find the problem and then told they would call me back within 24 hours absolute waste of my time  for no reason,0
"I wanted to become an amazon drop shipper , they automatically deducted $39 from my account without my permission\Hoping, I will be  I.D verified via zoom so I can start selling , three dates and times were bookedNow they put me on review and appeal without confirming a dam date and time of the three zoom i.d sessions!!What nonsense ! been shoved around from pillar to post and all i want to do is sell and make frikken moneyI have 2.4k stock waiting in my spocket accout to go, please indicate for me in the chat which other sellers platform is more user friendly with customer support?absolute disgrace and Mr Bezos cares ......

"this is the first place i visit for DVDs and books, i've got so many bargains from this store and they were all new purchases!",2
"I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated shipment time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.",1
I love shopping with Amazon. But there is one order driver who is unprofessional. He covers up ring camera. Stands to one side and when you try to talk to him. He won’t answer you. He wil post a letterbox parcel through letterbox. Then proceeds to ring the bell. If he has a large parcel he rings bell and knocks on door. He then walks away leaving parcel on doorstep.I’ve reported it but he’s still delivering parcels,1
"Good items on sale! Any of those didn't show up as ""ordinary"" or ""disappointing"", and I've been satisfied with most of my orders.Still, I wrote a review about a item to the seller, it has been two weeks, and it is not on the item reviews. My opinion is important, and they just cant appreciate it? Whatever, keep your junk without.",1
They do not care at all about their buyers or sellers. They just want your money.,0
"Order item 7th October and was told it would be delivered by 14th October.  After wasting 3 days waiting for this parcel, I was told by the message bot to wait until 19th and contact again. Do they not realise people and  life and work.",1
"Eventually I got my order however they delivered to the wrong address, I had to go knocking on doors looking for my order which I needed on a urgent basis and this was not the first time thi has happened, such a well funded company, they must get things right, why does this have to happen, this cased me great stress and fraustration...",1
"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience. I don't know seller, if he is not responding you, I bought it because of your trust, Order number :- 403-3552607-1022716Deepak #amazon #onlineshopping #scammersALERT #amazonsale #amazondeals #AmazonCustomer #amazoncheat",0

"I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer assistance numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer assistance saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a fine way to treat their loyal customers.",1

"Sold me devices that I cannot useAmazon have sold me devices, falsely claiming that they allow me access to my music, to call my family, to stream video, etc. and I am unable to ANY of this on the devices at all. Amazon REFUSE (SEVEN attempts so far) to remove 2-factor authentication from my account meaning that I cannot register or access ANY of my devices (Echo, Echo Show, etc.). I have provided proofs of who I am (driving licence, passport, Iqama, etc.) as requested and STILL they refuse to remove this 'feature' despite PROMISING every time to do so. No only is this false advertising, it is also breaking the law under the UK Data Protection Act by denying me access to information that they are holding about me.",0
"I haven't been very happy with the Amazon Prime Service for a while now.   I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about support I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding order.  Normally their shipping and order estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.",1
Amazon very very fine support number 6291783354//7462924659,1
Will not order from them again and I will and have started a civil suit against them for Failure To Deliver as promised as expected reasonably upon purchasing. I find them a disgusting disgraceful company that should be out of business for bad business practices. ,0
"Extremely poor!  I can only add to the reviews already placed on trust pilot!My advice to any customer purchasing from Amazon make sure you order the correct sizing (I realise that can be difficult at times due to difference in garment sizing) Also the items clothing displayed on Amazon ARE NOT always identical to the material , quality  shown.let’s hope all is well and fits whatever you purchase as once making a return you could be waiting up to 3 weeks for this to process and to show in your Amazon account . I made so many calls it was unbelievable to ask them to refund my account . Although they assured me by email they had processed and credited my account there was no evidence of this Contacted my bank for suppprt, finally a refund Avoid ordering clothing if you can Extremely poor service I would give no stars if that was possible on this forum",0
I've had 2 accounts closed because I supposedly violated terms and policies! How you ask from asking fro refunds on items that I had not received and they said they were delivered. When investigated I was told that they were indeed delivered when in fact they were not. I literally spent thousands on amazon. It's the best place to buy my Anime stuff. I would continue to spend thousands if it wasnt for my account being closed then I made a new one and it was immediately closed. Super upset and dissatisfied and disappointed especially when they didnt even consider were they were putting my packages or even that some of them would come weeks after saying they were delivered. They will steal you money and then call you a liar.DO NOT USE THEM!!!!,0
"Amazon was my go to until I noticed an issue for items I hadn't received or purchase I didn't make or returned and I keep getting insufficient fund notices. Eventually was locked out of my account fr fraudulent activity, get back in and it happened several times. I have many devices linked to that account such as echo and fire tablet as well as fire sticks. It is a great inconvenience and the customer assistance has suffered and not pleasant t deal with for resolving issues. He there's the new found fees for everything even that which use to be free. I have been a vip customer for years today I use other sites because f the new found issues. I hope things get better or I will not be using them in the ear future.",1
"They have EVERYTHING.  So, I just ask for Amazon GCs for birthdays and Christmas.  Every year I  build up a nice credit balance that I can use anytime.  Also, it can be good for all my friends & family, who are online, so it's easy to just send GCs for birthday gifts.  One-stop, all occasion solution.  I love the reviews; so helpful for making my shopping decisions.",2
Once again my delivery is late with a message saying “we’re so sorry”.I’m so tired of this company lying about delivery times. Absolutely nothing shows up when it says it will. I’m starting not to think that prime is worth it. I can get free delivery pretty much anywhere.,0
Since joining Amazon been getting scam calls everyday. Won’t ever use again,0

"I used to be a huge Amazon promoter. Their prices might have been slightly higher but reasonable when factoring in the whole experience including shipping times, customer service, ease returns etc. They will tell you that their shipping times remain unchanged, based on the fact that it's 2 days from the actual shipping of the item. The reality is I used to receive things in 2 or three days depending on the time of day I ordered it. Most days they'd ship it out the same day. Now they have a built in 5 day delay to ship resulting in 1 week delivery. Walmart plus still has true 2 day shipping. I'm cancelling my Prime subscription.",0
average The design of website is not very simple and convenient. It is not a kind of shopping vibe. All of the things are unremarkable.,1
"I love Amazon! They sell great, neat, and fun things. When I receive their packages, I feel excited. (Just my opinion!) Although, I always have to get refunds on clothing that do not fit, which is quite annoying. I do still love shopping! Even on Amazon.com! I also love making Wish Lists! Thanks Amazon.com! I am grateful for your company!",1

Amazon has gone downhill. My last several orders have been late and I even had to cancel some. It sucks to see something that's supposedly guaranteed to be delivered by a certain time be tracked to be sitting in their distribution center 30 minutes away but still be delivered three days late. They say you're recourse is to be refunded your delivery fee but it's supposedly free with prime so your stuff is late and you no recourse. Makes me wonder if it's worth keeping my prime membership. Maybe if everybody cancelled their membership they'd get the clue and start doing better.,0
I am an Amazon Prime member. I love the TV opportunities that are available with my Amazon Prime membership as well as the 2-day shipping. Icount on the reviews that are available and before I purchase things,2

"Ordered a mattress during their prime 2 day deal event, booked in for shipment 2 weeks later but 2 days before the scheduled shipment I received a notification that the order had been cancelled as the item was damaged on receipt at their depot. I enquired as to why a replacement wasn't sent as it is still available to purchase on their website, but was not 'that was not possible' they informed me I could reorder the item, but at the new higher price (150 pounds more than it was on sale) it feels as if they simply didn't wish to honour the sale price which I feel they should have done.",1

"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer support at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1

"Decent online shop, friendly customer assistance and fast shipping, I only have two minors complaint about Amazon and hope they can improve on it. Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement. SERIOUSLY!? For the past 10 orders, I do not have any problems with my billing address. In the end have to create a brand new account.",1
Find amazon to be fine but I have prime and next day shipment but even when its listed as next day shipment I didn't get it next day was apposed to recive item today but instead its coming another day  I have checked to make sure item was prime shipment and it is this has happened few times,1

"Overall I do not have a problem with Amazon. Admittedly, the order support has been slow since COVID 19,but I can accept that.  I can not accept that there have been two occurrences when I place an order and then the item simply disappears. The item is still for sale but for triple the price or more. Of course when you contact customer support they claim the item is no longer available which is dishonest and untrue. I do not believe this is a way to run a company but perhaps customers matter less when the owner is a billionaire.",1

Took box, placed on tile, sprinkler shifted down and spike end penetrated box and cracked my tile.  I have pics of the sealed box with spike sticking out and video of the box opening to show how poorly packaged.  Amazon offers as lousy $15.  Really, how about negiligence?  I am out over $300 to get a decent tile guy to come back at least 2 times to complete this repair, and hopefully without damaging surounding tiles.  Unbelieve fraudsters Amazon.",0

I am so happy that I broke up with Amazon.I use to use them for almost everything. I have found that if I go directly to the companies I wish to order from that I am actually saving money! Not a lot but a few$$. But this all adds up and the idea that you are saving on Amazon is not true in most cases. Start supporting the people that make the products you like. There is no reason for Amazon to be the middleman.,0
"Since I commenced utilizing Amazon several years ago, they have restricted my account solely for submitting reviews on my items. This has led to a plethora of items that require reviews! Despite numerous attempts to communicate with them via email support over the years, their responses have been unresponsive and ineffectual.",1
"Amazon is #1 in my book. I highly recommend using Amazon for your online shopping needs. I order through them on a continuous basis from as small as a pencil sharpener, clothes, home theatre system, up to car parts and all. I have not once since shopping and ordering through this site ever had any problems or had any issues with any of my orders. They have EVERYTHING and the prices are way cheaper then in the stores and best of all it's shipped right to you. Amazon is my favorite place to shop and I don't have to go to a ton of different stores it's all in one spot at my fingertips then delivered to my door within 3-5 days max. I love Amazon and I guarantee you will too. Best site ever!!",2
"Fraud. Bought a piece of furniture listed as sold and shipped by amazon. Amazon changed the order after it was made so it was shipped by a third party instead. The third party took our money, never sent the product, then went out of business. Amazon tried to leave us on the hook for the purchase even though the listing did and still shows they were the ones selling it. When we asked them to look at it, they claimed they can’t see their own listings and the the screenshot my husband sent couldn’t be viewed as his email wasn’t on file….that’s not how the internet works, but that certainly didn’t stop them from trying. We wanted them to ship us the product they sold us (and are still selling, so what’s the issue?) at the price we paid (since we got it on sale). Not that hard. Instead, the supervisor hung up on us and issued a refund. If that hadn’t happened, we’d have claimed fraud through or bank. It’s still fraud, we just have our money back now. They knew they screwed up but refused to admit it or fix it and sent a refund to legally cover themselves. Additionally, they blocked us from leaving a review on the item and we’ve been blocked from contacting customer service regarding the order. I’ve since cancelled all related subscriptions and will not be renewing our prime membership when it expires. So long Amazon.",0

"I have been an amazon prime member for yrs, Fraudulent charges were made on my Amazon account at the end of April, so because I disputed the charges Amazon locked me out of my prime account,(to be expected), except they didn't stop there, no they decided to rob me of my thousands of dollars in movie and music purchases, and all of my Amazon devices when they also deemed it appropriate to lock me out of my prime movie and music accounts, not to mention none of my Amazon Alexas and echos will work due to all being registered to my account that had fraudulent activity... So then I called Amazon and confirmed I did not make those purchases dozens of times and here we are 4-5 months later and I'm still locked out of all my stuff and services that have already been bought and paid for??? Which is weird, I have never had the clerk from the grocery store come into my house and take all the food I just bought from my fridge, freezer, and pantry.... I have never had the manager of kohls show up at my house and confiscate the school clothes I just bought for my children.... I am not sure why Amazon thinks it is acceptable to remove access to movies and music that have already been PAID for... Or how they think it is appropriate to block the functionality of my devices that have already been PAID for with the understanding they would FUNCTION!!! I am beyond disgusted with treatment and handling of this whole situation.... I'm honestly not even sure it's legal.... It seems alot like theft to me... I honestly don't ever want to purchase anything from Amazon ever again after this and neither do family and friends... a full refund for ALL of my movies, music, and devices would be appreciated",0

It’s sad when you constantly spend your hard earned money on Amazon and when it’s there turn to fix the issue that you are having they make you feel like your being questioned by the fbi i think after the holidays I’m going to cancel my Amazon account and go over to Temu,0
I just don’t like about amazon is the customer cares just one thing. Always when the Usps fails on the day they supposed to deliver and they don’t. Why in the world like a customer do I have to call and fix it ? I’m paying for the assistance . They have to contact the postal office and fix it . That is why I’m paying for that assistance btw is not cheap . “Amazon prime”  I hope they can do something about it,1

"These guys do business and they do it right. Items that you buy from them are guaranteed to arrive at the shipping speed that you tag onto your order and the customer service is great. Very on top of things and they truly want to make sure that you have a great buying experience. On top of that, they offer pretty good discounts on a lot of the items people normally buy, which is definitely a plus. Will definitely buy from in the future. I highly recommend buying from them.",2
Been having nightmare experience with their customer services from emails to phone calls. It's been 2 months that I have been trying to get someone to help me. How can you have a customer service department that is only connected to the accounts department via email. The accounts department is unreachable!Absolutely ridiculous. Of all my shopping experiences Amazon has proven to be the worst nightmare there ever was.Annoyed!,0
I absolutely love amazon!!!!!! I can find everything I need there.I haven't had any problems with my orders mostly because I always make sure to read the reviews so I know if the product is as advertised. Its best to spend a couple extra bucks on a product that has a lot of reviews and customer pictures than one that has the same product but no review at a lower price. Most cases its still cheaper than in store.,2

"I have purchased a total of $2520 Xbox gift cards from Amazon for a research project. During my purchase process, I was told that Amazon suspected some fake purchase activities on my account and cancelled my orders and locked my account. After calling them, I was told several times that my account was restored and that I was good to go. That repeated a couple of times but I was able to purchase a total of $2520 Xbox gift cards.Then the fun started: When I redeemed the codes, the Microsoft Xbox system told me that some of the codes were already redeemed. The unredeemable codes added up to $610.So I contacted Amazon and was told to contact Microsoft/Xbox. I then contacted Microsoft/Xbox. After Microsoft/Xbox investigated this, they said that the $610 worth of gift codes were deactivated by Amazon before being sold to me. In other words, I received deactivated codes from Amazon.I then contacted Amazon again and was told to either dispute the $610 with my credit card company or continue asking if Microsoft/Xbox would re-issue me new codes of $610.Why asking a third party to pay for your mistakes? As of today, after three months of repeated conversation with Amazon, I am still not refunded for the $610 in total. What an unprofessional company that takes advantage of consumers and charge their money without offering the goods!",0
I'm a prime member for the past 9 years. The first few years there were some hiccups but it's gotten better. Some of the items I bought got one day or even same day shipping if I ordered it in time. Wish they had kept the pre-order discounts when it came to video games since video games are so expensive nowadays. Other than that no complaints really.,2
"First, I ordered a Dymo Label printer and received some ridiculous hand held embossed sticker maker. I returned the item, never got the refund. Tried calling several times to track refund, they first said they didnt get the return, then finally acknowledged the return, but said because it was over 100 I have to wait 10 days for them to process the refund, a month later, they said to call my bank because they sent the refund, the next time I called they said oops they put my refund on a gift card. They did not. Now, I called for a fifth time, they're processing refund to the card I used to purchase the item but to wait 7 days. This is SO unprofessional and irresponsible.  I am canceling my membership and never shopping with them again. BYE!",0
"I am a Amazon Prime member and I am so pleased with the prices, customer service, and their incredibly fast delivery!  The best membership dollars Ive spent this year... FANTASTIC!",2
I absolutely love Amazon. The entire shopping on Amazon.com experience is stress free and they have almost everything I need without the waiting in line and their return policy is amazing.  Wish I had bought stock back when they first got started. More companies should model their customer service. Keep up the good work Amazon.,2

"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day shipment was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the goods.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day shipment is bs.  I’ve had several two-day shipment packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the shipment would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day shipment mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the goodss sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1
After four years my firestick stop working I asked customer if they could help me with it.    We tried everything try to make it work still after and hour wouldn't budge. So he said you can buy a new one I call you Monday you can keep the product we can refund your money. He lied they said I had to return the product before they can return my money my refund. He conned me at buying a product and then when I got it the remote didn't work either and they wouldn't even help me with that..,0
Its hit and miss with Amazon. I've had acceptable and average interactions,1
"Have been a Amazon Prime member for 2 years. It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the shipment trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get items replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students. I still love Amazon Products but don't know if they are worth the shipping hassle. Questioning Prime Membership. (Netflix for Movies  is better)",1
Sad to say Amazon is getting worse. Talking to customer support doesn't correct the problem. My problem Amazon have started to leave deliveries on the door step and not waiting just drop and walk. The package is in view from the road. Lastly they are allowing sellers to sell cheap Chinese goodss that break within weeks…,1

"Their customer service have NO IDEA what they are doing!I reported a major issue with my account whereby I could not view any items on my wish list or old orders, also could not open any item to see the full details or add to a cart.I spent 3 hours being passed from one operator to another and at the end I was told other customers was having the same issues and should be resolved shortly.I left it 3 days and tried again, same issue!  Again I contact customer support, been pushed from one person to another and keep asking for same original info (glad I made a list I could copy and paste)!I have had no issues in the past and only 2 days before this started I had viewed and added items to my wish list!  This is a problem their end, I can use Amazon.co.uk without any issues.All they say is please stay connected I am working on it and then push it to someone else!TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!",0

They’ve gotten difficult over the years.  I recently had items in my cart and called prior to ordering and the second rep (Amazon Locker Specialist) explained the items weren’t eligible for Amazon Locker and why but to go ahead with shipment to a UPS Store and they’d make an exception and reimburse the per package fee.  I received the three packages today and called for the $15.  The first agent insisted after I explained it all again there was “no record” like I’d made it up.  I think their game is for the consumer to give up. He transferred me to a supervisor who also made me explain it before mentioning they “have a recording of the conversation” and she credited $15.,1
I use to like Amazon. Yet recently they have beenterrible. They sent me the wrong item today also itwas chipped. After trying to customer service forwhat felt like forever. I was told to contact the seller.Which I think is ridiculous  because it said shippingfulfilled by Amazon..,0

"Always waste more than an hour to have simple questions answered... We could ignore the fact that their English is not the best if they were actually helpful, but besides not being able to understand what you write, what they write is also not really clear.Was forced to keep on chatting with someone when I specifically requested to have the chat transferred to someone else I was told:- there is no such option (when they constantly transfer me around from person to person when they can't answer questions);- and shortly after I was also told ""If you confirm the issue we can transfer to relevant team"" - what kind of treatment is this?If I no longer want to have this person wasting my time, why am I being forced to speak with this person? Constantly kept on asking this person to either transfer or end the chat - and they just kept on refusing and taking the longest time to even reply.Every single time I contact them they are always inattentive (probably working on multiple cases at once), slow to react, & not knowledgeable about what they are saying. Huge waste of time",0

"I placed an order, Amazon provided the wrong tracking number, or the seller provided the wrong tracking number to them. It was delivered to another state, and I know it was not my item because it was described by USPS as a small packet item delivered to mailbox, my item was a treadmill which would not be a small packet that could be delivered in a mailbox.I tried contacting the seller and with no success. I looked for a way to contact Amazon to tell them that contrary to showing the item was delivered, it was not delivered and that I was getting no satisfaction from the seller, I looked everywhere on Amazon, there is NO customer service to contact for such issues - nothing at all. I finally had to contact the bank to dispute the charge because there was no way for me to get any assistance from Amazon.",0
"I don't know what the role of customer service reps is since they don't seem to have the ability to help beyond the standard buttons you can access yourself.I placed an order with 2-day shipping, but due to the quantity I ordered, I ultimately got an email stating the delivery date was now going to be over 3 weeks out. This was not acceptable for my timeline so I requested to cancel within an hour. I was told it was too far along in the shipping process to cancel. I questioned how that could be when it wasn't shipping for 3 weeks. No one could give me an answer to that. Every time they would respond with the same generic response that when items are shipping very soon, they can't be cancelled. I don't know how 3 weeks is soon. One rep had kids crying in the background and just said ""ummm"" for 10 minutes without providing any meaningful information at all. The ""supervisor"" had dogs barking in the background and gave the exact same generic response that didn't actually apply to my situation or order. Never got any resolution as no one was empowered to do anything more than try the same cancel button I have access to on my account.Really a baffling experience that this is the type of service Amazon provides.",0

I contacted customer service and after over an hour of arguing with them, they said that I can't have a refund because the order is expired and it's to late.

This, by law, must be refunded, but no, they will let me return it with a restocking fee.  Yes, that is right, a restocking fee for a product that is recalled and they are going to restock it!!!!!!

I ordered a sandisk 1tb microsd from Amazon and it was perfectly working. The only thing I hate about Amazon is their support which isn't very humanly.,1
I’ve always had fairly decent usages with amazon - it’s more the shipment supports! Ever since they started cap amounts (so spend £20 to get anything delivered free) and then outsourcing shipment. Numerous times I have had deliveries marked as ‘handed to a resident’ when it hasn’t and is either lost of hanging out the letterbox for someone to steal!,1
"I returned an item that was sold as new although it was used and amazon told me to return it and buy a new one. The only other such item was a lot more expensive, so they wrote me an email promising to cover price difference and import duties.Once I received the new item and contacted them for refund, they went back on what i have in writing and now refuse to uphold their end of the bargain. Desplicable behavior from a company that used to pride itself of their customer service.I spent almost an hour on the phone and nothing. Will not buy again.",0

"I ordered an external battery, airtags, and waterproof airtag covers. Some of the items were missing, and others arrived damaged beyond repair because the Amazon box had no packing around the individual items, and the weight of each item crushed other items and caused the tape to break on the Amazon box, allowing some of the items to fall out. I have contacted Amazon three times and spent over 3 hours on the phone, only to be hung up on. I have contacted them by chat 15 times with no help. One person finally said I would receive a refund but had lied. They told me to return the items through UPS, but UPS will not take the package because the items contain lithium and are dangerous to ship through the mail. I was then told to get a police report, but the police wouldn't write a report when the package was not stolen, and it was Amazon's fault for not packing the box properly. The items cost me $179.25, and I cannot get a refund, and Amazon refuses to help. They just reply with automated responses to return the items or get a police report. Still, I cannot do either because of the circumstances they caused by not packing the items properly for shipping. Buyer beware! Do not order expensive tech through Amazon because you cannot trust that they will be adequately packaged, and if they arrive damaged, Amazon will not issue a refund. I'm left with dangerous, useless items that I cannot dispose of.",0

It was deliverd today by an Amazon delivery driver, not UPS. Pretty cool, right? Not so much. The fixture and package were smashed flat accross the center with a clear truck tire print. I soon discovered what was once amazing customer service, is now horrible. There was no option to speak with anyone over the phone, and my only resolution option is send it back and have it replaced! So this package which was ran over by a truck shipped from an Amazon facility, where it was picked by an Amazon employee, loaded by an Amazon employee, and delivered by an Amazon employee ... None of whom cared that it was smashed flat with a tire track going accross it? You've got to be kidding me! Now I'm told I have to ship it back ... More like customer disservice.",0

I notified amazon about this and they were very decent to give me £10 voucher as they have no say on 3rd company pricing.I love amazon but companies doing this are not acceptable.I was hoping to get them for decent price on pay day they will be £30 by then haha.,1
"Terrible customer service from Amazon. I bought a Nadalan Freesat box on Amazon.  It will only pick up a few channels and not  most of the major channels.  I have a different make of Freesat box working in a different room but from the same dish and that works fine so I know the Nadalan box is the issue.  As the item did not work and is functionally virtually useless, I sought to return it.  Every time I attempt to print a return label via the Amazon website, I get an error message and that they were attempting to sort this out.  I called Amazon and they said they would sort this out.  5 days later and the issue persists.  I was told they would e-mail a return label and Amazon have failed to do so.  I received an e-mail saying they would phone back the following day and they did not do so. I can only conclude that they have lost interest and by adopting such a poor and unhelpful stance they hope they will not have to deal with the issue.",0

My wife’s neuropathic condition is severe so her daughter likes to send her some stuff. We went to the mailbox and found out package open and tampered with. Amazon and usps needs to be held accountable. I don’t understand how this and the app doesn’t allow for us to upload pictures to show how bad usps and Amazon has been.,0
"I've been shopping with amazon for over 6 years now, I think, and as for the quality of the products and packaging - there's nothing to complain about. Everything's been perfect in this respect. The site is easy to navigate and has provided 100% secure payment so far. I order a lot of books there - awesome choice, perfect quality What I don't like are high UPS express shipping rates to Russia (but they do fulfill the delivery on time or sooner, I give them that) and some regional issues, where I cannot order certain stuff even for personal use, but that's the customs issue and import policies, I guess.",2
"F*** amazon, rude driver and customer service, Danea hope you get karma from behind the screen. :) also they will cancel your order and take forever to give you the money back.",0
Didn't get my refund despite them having to product back.,0
"Anytime I ordered something I recieved it, packaging unharmed and intact. Their customer support assistance is extraordinarily horrible though",1
Most of the stuff I usually buy from amazon and I still do that but I really hate the way customer assistance works...because you have to explain your query to customer assistance from the beginning if you have to call them again...,1
"While prices are not as low as they used to be, and some of the marketplace sellers are rather awful. Overall the customer experience wi Amazon remains the best I’ve tried yet.",2
Since you don't care about free speech for everyone and since you want monopolize everything you can kiss my &$$! I don't need you! All you want is to push democrat rhetoric and suppress any others that don't agree with you. You are the fascist!,0
"I was wondering when my order would be delivered.I asked if they could ask the supplier, but kept replying, we don't know when and we don't have the information. Just ask the supplier, what is so difficult about that I wonder.Doesn't sound like they asked the supplier and get back on me later by email.Terrible customer service, how has this become one of the biggest ordering websites/company.No effort in to want to please their customer at all.I ordered Adidas Superstar black with white stripes, a standard Adidas model, ordered it almost a month ago. But they kept replying, we don't know when.All I want to know is if it will be this year or not, not an exact date, just let me know when approximately they will be in stock. Children in the third world would have done a better job, as they make the shoes probably.This will be a wager if I will place a order again on Amazon, damn this was really bad, and milking on the blue-collar and poor sweatshop children. Damn, this was just terrible customer service!Did not think it could be worse, but Amazon realized it!",0
"I have ordered many things from Amazon and I have never had a problem with this app.Fast delivery and amazing quality with each and every single package, I personally would use Amazon over any other app that delivers",2
"ordered arrived the next day just in time for a birthday present, pleased with quality of product",2
"Amazon are a great company being let down by too many order drivers not following saved order instructions in our area ( Shortstown, Bedford ).",1
"Look here first before you hit the shops, i have found so many bargins on amazon, and you dont always have to pay delivery which is even better.",2
Sometimes there are a few problems with Amazon.,1
Excellent service and any problems or quibbles quickly and easily resolved.,2
Fast delivery order really appreciate your quick delivery within two working day it was recieved today.. Thank you,2
"60% stuff in my daily life were bought online. Amazon is always my first choice website. I can find almost everything from it, and its service and product quality is guaranteed and trustable.",2
Their chat customer support is absolutely rubbish. They want you to keep typing the same thing over and over. I gave up in the end.,1
Cracked screen of TV. Asked for returnal. I could not pickl time and date. I was sitting home all the time waiting for pick up. Carreer said no one at home. Lie!,0
they dropped phone support today.  not very customer centric.blinded sided everyone,0
"I think Amazon is guaranteed to be the only company still in business. I,ve ordered lots during lockdown. Always received goods promptly and delivery guy always pleasant. Ordered something 8pm last night being delivered today what service!",2
Bought items from Amazon for past four years. Always fast delivery with no problems .,2
"PACKAGING!!!!! Im very disappointed that less packaging has not been implemented yet- despite what Amazon keeps saying!?! My last order was ridiculous - a huge box with paper stuffing and bubble wrap for a 30ml bottle!?! And I didn’t order it on rush, it was a regular shipped item. What a waste!! Please please reconsider how you package items!",0
"Amazon customer service doesnt even deserve 1 star. My fiance and I ordered decorations for our wedding next month, and they delivered it to the wrong address. They offered to refund to a gift card to re order. Well we did and that didnt make it either. Now we are to the point thst we will never use amazon again, and they wont refund my money back to my original account, they want to instead send another gift card. My fiance has been on the phone for the past 2 days trying to resolve this and get our money back and they refuse to refund my money back to my bank. Poor service lost this customer and family for life.  F#&* you Amazon.",0
"Terrible customer service after I complained about not receiving several packages. When I canceled my order and subscription, they denied the refund of the subscription price and put a portion of my refund on a gift card even though I used my debit card to make the purchases. I will NEVER use Amazon again and I am getting rid of my Amazon TV. Hello Walmart+ you have a new customer.",0
Most of the stuff I usually buy from amazon and I still do that but I really hate the way customer assistance works...because you have to explain your query to customer assistance from the beginning if you have to call them again...,1
"Purchased a knee brace from amazon and was asked for a review, so I reviewed it telling them that it was a good brace and much cheaper than a hospital fitted device. They rejected my review for some nebulous reason thus wasting my time. It's not the first time I've received a rejection for a product review and makes me wonder what they are hiding. Are they selling this brace illegally? Another aspect of their product reviews is what I consider false reviews. I bought two different thumb drives which proved to be of much less capacity than described yet had good reviews. I verified the drive capacity with f3probe yet their reviews state the drive capacity is as claimed. This alone is two strikes against ethics. Amazon blows.",0
"I order a shirt on Amazon,it look as picture,i like everything if the size fits,i usually wear a small,but a meduim is small for me.I don't know how to choose the size.",1
Whats the point in leaving a review of Amazon on its own website as requested only for it to be rejected because it was negative.  Did you know it will only accept and display only positive reviews of itself in which case the reviews Amazon display are totally unrepresentative of the real situationNow you know why on its own website 'Amazon' has a 100% feedback.   Lets not mention the ones it rejected.,0
"Best for shopping. I am a regular buyer from amazon . I love their deals and offers.My laptop and smartphone from their website . No doubt, they are best retail company in world.",2
"I have been a loyal customer for decades on amazon and been purchasing everything from it. Needless to say I've spent a fortune on amazon throughout the years. But I've been so disappointed lately that I've made up my mind to avoid amazon at all cost now. It has been the monopolistic online market place due to its good customer service. Now they don't give a *** about you anymore. I guess since it's so big now it doesn't care about one person's business. It's expected that you receive your orders late and when you contact them they are not even slightest apologetic. The customer specialists have been very rude with all my questions and they make you wait for 30 mins with no solution to any of your problems. And when you don't respond right away they disconnect you. I've been shocked by how bad it is now. It reminds me of bullies at high school. Like I need to beg them to give them my money and not even expect to get what I pay for. Wow. You see that you've got where you are because you showed you care about your customers. If you stop, you will go out of business NO MATTER HOW BIG YOU ARE.",0
... but overall one of my favorite online shops. I guess there is not much you cannot get there.,2
"Prime ..I agree with other posters here and other sites. Prime is no longer the 'next day delivery' promised. In fact paying Prime is now rip off becaue deliveries are the same without paying for it. In effect its a wste of money.Prime offers other  benefits --so they say . Music .. theres a rotten selection and only there to force you into subscribing to their millions of songs library . Its cheaper and better to get Spotify and forget Amazon music altogether.  During this year the music selection has been reduced continually . Now its useless. Asking for a song gets the generic response 'Heres a  station you might find if your lucky what you are lookng for '  Generally you dont . so thats another waste of time.Linking Spotify to the Echo account used to be easy . Now they make it difficult to force you into the poor Amazon Music.Amazon Prime Videos . another free benefit!!!   It offers nothing more than a few old movies . Far better is available elsewhere. Netfilx is FAR superior and at the same subcription price . Amazon is no competitor.Finally the Echo units 'age' and become deaf. I have 4 ... YES FOUR , in different continents and they all suffer from the same deafness problem. In my opinion its an inbuilt planned problem designed to make you buy another later version.  Dirty business practice.I wouldnt buy another echo..ever. I recommend you dont either.Nor would I subscribe to Prime. tyhose who have already done so would be well advised to review any benefit . They like me and others will conclude theres no value and cancel for refund",0
Best app for shopping,1
"Generally okay in my interaction. My only real issue is the stupid ""Try now pay later"" Wardrobe system. They took money out of my account instantly and i was told it would be refunded within 5-10 days. What is the point in the system if i'm just going to be charged straight away? I'm not gonna use the system if i had the money to pay for it there and then, am i? If i wasn't to be refunded until the 10th day then i'm effectively paying for the item twice until the refund is issued. The scheme, to me, just sounds like I'm giving Amazon a small loan. Bloody stupid.",1
"I am no longer able to write reviews on any of their goodss or use the chat for help.  Have to call Amazon (1-800-275-2273) every time I need help with something or have an issue.They said I went against one of their policies but will not let me know what they are talking about, just send a generic e-mail. Cannot talk to anyone in that department also to find out why.We are prime time members been buying books from them for my kindle since they started, we order a lot of items from them, as easier than going to several stores to look for a certain item. Also can get items through them faster usually than other online shopping.",1
"*** Truly DISAPPOINTING experiences ***I ordered an item, before finalizing the order I had a total for the item, the shipping and the Tax. Then I was prompted renew my Prime Membership and take advantage of Free Shipping and 2-3 days delivery. So, I said fine. I renewed my Prime Membership and clicked proceed. But I was still charged for Shipping and had to wait over two weeks for the order to arrive. Not only the total cost of the order stayed the same but also I had a 2-3 WEEKS delivery now!. So, practically no advantage or incentive to have Prime. I could cancel my membership online but I was curious as to why my Prim Membership was of no use. So I called the customer service.I spoke with the first representative whom I could hardly hear or understand. After a while he put me through to a supervisor. The lady supervisor pick up the line after about five minutes. I asked her the same question. She had no convincing answer. I then said OK, could you please cancel my Prime Membership. She said sure. She put me on hold again, then came back in about three minutes and said ""OK I have canceled your order"". I said why did you cancel my order? I just asked to cancel my USELESS Prime Membership. She simply said sorry, I can cancel your Prime NOW! What kind of people does Amazon hire. Not only they do not care but they do not listen either. I am truly disappointed at Prime. Then again, what can you expect from a company so big - and with no regards to Individual Customers.",0
Service is acceptable. easy to order.,1
I have been trying to get hold of amazon one phone number they give dosent exist I live in a block of flats and they are given the code to get in but the lazy driver opens the door and throws all the parcel just inside for anyone to take one of mine was left out in.the pouring rain i was lucky because my next door neighbour saw it and gave it to me before it got to wet at this time of year they should be more careful.where they throw parcels,1
"Amazon is the worst website do not get scammed by this overhyped business there terrible, no customer service number, if you encounter any problems, GOOD LUCK!",0
"I recently bought a monitor on Amazon, it was marked as A rated for energy consumtion. Little did I know this was on the old classification and and when it arrived it was rated F. I would not have considered it with that rating so until Amazon get all the ratings for outside sellers corrected I would reccomend checking the manufacturers website.I kept the monitor because after speaking to the seller, I was satisfied it was not their fault. I wrote a review for Amazon but it may not have been accepted by them as it was critical of them.",1
Absolute horrific customer service. I seriously doubt these people had any training and having bad manners is apparently part of their job description.,0
This has been a very stressful experience for my wife and her father.We ordered an adjustable bed for my father in law who was being discharged from hospital he is 73 and in ill health so he has come to live with us he can’t get in and out of a normal bed so we ordered this one from Amazon as it would be delivered earlier than others we looked at with other companies as until than his sleeping on a sofa so we really need one asap.First the bed was to be delivered between the 18th-19th Nov than it was confirmed it would be delivered on 19th that was fine I took a day off work and lost a days pay but it had to be done the bed never arrived and no word to say what was happening than that night it was updated to say it’l now be delivered between 20th-25th so I messaged customer service who apologised and said they would refund me £7.99! Personally I find that an insult after waiting in all day and as I say losing a days pay.I was very surprised by Amazon as I’ve usually found the customer service is very helpful and knowledgeable.I asked to cancel the order but apparently that’s not possible and informed I would now have to refuse delivery at the door.I couldn’t get anywhere with customer service at all so I’m now closing my Amazon account and all connected accounts and will never use them again I just feel like they couldn’t be bothered to find a solution so I will never spend my money with them again.I now need to start looking elsewhere for a bed.My father in laws physio only agreed to discharging him when she knew the adjustable bed would be here asap if she had known it wasn’t being delivered his discharge from hospital would of been delayed until it did arrive.,0
"Truly non-existent customer service, they just send you around in circles. Bought a product from them, it’s defective so go to return it but, even though I have the physical receipt, it doesn’t show up in my order history!!?? They essentially make that my fault and give me various suggestions re. altering my settings which still don’t reveal my order history so I can’t return my defective product…let’s face it, they don’t care really anyway…awful people.",0
"I bought all my family's Christmas presents from their Amazon wish lists, so quick & easy!",2
"great service, especially if you do not have mush choice at your location",2
"Overall not too ordinary, amazing prices and basically everything you need. Smooth process of buying and returning of items, never had any issues in that area, my only pretty big minus is there courier drivers, 90% of the time they either knock and leave in full view of people walking past and are back in there van and driven off before you even open the door, or most the time they don't even knock on the door and leave it in full view of people, if I didn't follow the tracking as closely as I do I wouldn't be surprised if half my parcels get stolen. Overall amazing shopping interaction but extremely lacking in courier drivers.",1
"I've been a loyal amazon customer and I'm a little upset that the return policy is difficult. I ordered a large corset and it wouldn't even rap around my waist . I bought a size smaller so I could lose weight to get  into it but i can't because it will take me like 3-4 month to lose enough weight to squeeze my body i the small corset !!I feel like the packaging could b a little more friendly . Maybe some candy or a business card , but of course it's not up to Amazon.",1
Absolutely fantastic. Placed an order via a 3rd party who used Amazon shipping. Unfortunately the 3rd party messed up the address but the driver for amazon managed to deliver the item even though the address on the package didn't exist! Would definitely recommend them for shipping,2
"Dont try to buy anything guaranteed same day. I haven't had anything delivered same day even though guaranteed. Full of excuses about things being out of their control. This time, the items I bought are Amazon items, not delivered same day because of delay but rescheduled for delivery today. Still nothing due to issues ""beyond their control"". Their warehouse is 15 minutes from my house. There were 3 Amazon vans in my housing area all at the same time while I was driving home from work. How can their product being delivered by their vans less than 15 minutes away be out of their control 2 days straight? Then, when I ask for a refund, I get the run around and my status on the orders say I refused the packages when they delivered. IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED!!! This is the 3rd time they pulled this crap. The first two times they promised gift cards (which I never received). I don't need them anyways. Goodbye prime, goodbye Amazon!!",0
"Some great, some not great. Product offering is fantastic. Markup on the cheap stuff is not. But if i Use their App then that is on me. Easy returns. Free shipping. Good to go",1
"Even a couple of months ago Amazon was a company I trusted, they were communicative and seemed to care about their customers. Recently they are nothing like they were, it almost impossible to communicate with them, every customer query when answered is polite though negative and unhelpful and they don't respect their customers. I ordered a product the other day that was supposed to arrive 3 days later, the next day the date has suddenly changed saying it'll arrive in a month, when i tried to cancel the order as it will not arrive on time, the cancellation was not permitted as it was applied too late despite the item not being in dispatch.",0
"excellent company to do business with,very highly recommendeed",2
i have found something that amazon don't sell.i am a laryngectomee and i was after a larysnorkel freedom so i could go swimming again but i can't find on anywhere and even on the lary page i can't even pay for it so if amazon don't sell one then i give up but other wise its a acceptable firm to buy from,1
Not much else to say. Amazon has everything you want and it arrives in only 1 or 2 days.,2
"I buy almost everything through Amazon, it's so convenient when you're a Prime Member. Gotta love them for that! The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer support rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer support who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day. For an e-commerce company that deals with so many goodss, they did not a very fine job at properly packaging the glass items. Very disappointing!",1
"Not a huge fan, but I can see the decent aspects of the company. They just don't really tick all my boxes.",1
Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
"Never get back my refund, had me keep waiting for months, I dropped off the package, created incident report, also have my UPS receipt. Never get a clear answer.Customer service is outsource from another country. Horrible communication and language.  No customer service skill.",0
"I like shopping through Amazon but this last interaction might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the order really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for order people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, order person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1
I always check Amazon first before going anywhere else.  Great deals and free shipping on most items!,2
"There is always something wrong with Amazon.Starting from out of date food order, subscriptions with rising prices with every order.Ending on a useless document verification system, which is unable to verify documents accepted by ANY OTHER BRITISH company.That's why I quit my Prime membership after 6 years.",1
"I usually order from Amazon stuff with fine prices.. A few times it seems lately they would mess up my order, the first time oik it was fine but than the second time I am thinking what is going on... I called customer support and they told me there having problem with my address. I am thinking well you never had any other issues before. They did not give me a straight answer as to why.",1
"Their customer service application on their website is absolutely dire, none existent. There is no customer service application that is fit for purpose apart from a list that you can click on which is almost worthless; no customer services phone number, no customer services email you can actually engage with that is directly on there site, no complaints platform you can actually use. This company has ballooned into a monstrous entity that it has forgotten about customer services completely. They have ditched the core principles that the ""Customer is King"" and the ""Customer is the life blood of your business"". I'm starting to go off buying Amazon shopping because there is no proper avenue to give your grievance to, no proper customer service you can ask for help. Amazon doesn't care about (us) their customers'. Recent experiences using Amazon shopping on line has left me very frustrated with their systems. I ordered goods from them to arrive at an Amazon pick up hub, they send me a code to open the hub locker but it won't open. I spent 3 days trying to open it. What was worse I couldn't contact an Amazon services customer advisor because there isn't one, just a computer offering basic general questions that couldn't answer what I wanted answering. If I had a telephone number or an email then that would of helped my frustration but instead I'm left there standing frustrated that I had no idea why I couldn't access the hub and my parcels. But hey let's talk about global warming shall we! Now a van has to pick up my parcel send it back to the depot, then as I THINK about reordering my parcel another van has to pollute the air twice to get it to me; so much for Amazon's environmental policy well that is just a joke. Come on Amazon get a grip with customer services, stop making US the customers do all your dirty work and stop adding vehicle fumes to the environment unnecessarily transporting parcels back and forth when a customer services team can help reduce that problem. Very poor customer services. I'm shopping more and more on the high Street because I'm increasingly becoming more frustrated with Amazon shopping experiences.",0
I'm trying really hard to be fare but the more mess ups the harder it gets. Delivery of items have become hit or miss. The quality has been fairly acceptable when I do get them. My main issue is the refund process for items that I dont get delivered. It is time consuming and they are extremely picky on the way you reply. I should not have to jump through loops to get my money back. I really wish they would make it mandatory for drivers to take a pic of every shipment left. There needs to be a better way for drivers to confirm shipment address or they need to stop being lazy and actually pay attention to what address they are at.,1
"Not a huge fan, but I can see the fine aspects of the company. They just don't really tick all my boxes.",1
Had Amazon prime for a number of years now used to really enjoy watching the Amazon prime video but now since expecting you to pay more to watch movies with out ads in I will be cancelling my subscription and going back to Netflix as it’s just annoying we pay enough to stream as it is yet the money grabbing company high risen the price to watch with out ads joke,0
"Order an item said delivered, nowhere to be found. Had to order it again as can’t get a refund for 5 days so had to pay again. Then driver parks outside house never delivers it. Later that day unable to deliver, it’s been 3 days and still waiting for item and have lots all this time.",0
"I have spent lots of money with Amazon and have always loved the thing I get. Also love how fast it gets to me,  normally  2 days.",2
I have been using Amazon for a while and really like their customer assistance. I wish they audit sellers on the platform properly because many ship from china and return policy is not clear on those. ,1
"What did I dislike? Giving money to Bezos.What did I like? Good pricing, goodss, shipping, etc.",1
"Product purchased was OK. But. Amazon likes to fill your email box with demands for reviews.  Quite a nuisance, so I did.. and my review was rejected as ""not in compliance"" all I noted was the item bought was ""OK"" but not as acceptable as others for same price. Political correctness? perhaps. If they don't want honest albeit free speech... appraisals then stop asking for my opinion.",1
"Good products, fair price, excellent  delivery service.",2
cheap and fast; they sure are. however they cant help me in the sales process; just undercut everyone else who can,1
I use Amazon very often and I really enjoy it. I enjoy their fast shipping and have also used the site to find smaller shops that I have never heard about before. I will alwasy recommend Amazon.com,2
"Shocking. Just shocking. So we bought an Optigrill XL less than three months ago and the non stick coating is peeling off the bottom tray. Contacted them through chat, 90 minutes later, they are adamant they won’t exchange it because it’s now more expensive but they was prepared to refund me & credit me £24 to buy another one. Explained to them I have no box to send it in so they advised a carrier bag!!!!!! Seriously Amazon, sort your customer service team out. They are a joke. I’ve had to wrap it in a bin liner and lace it with brown tape. Absolutely pathetic company with terrible customer service.",0
I ordered a reclining chair only received one box was supposed to be two and nobody could tell me where the other box is or went. I am done with Amazon this is the second time I have ordered something and either didn’t get it or only received half. What can you do with only a back of a recliner and one arm? I’m so done,0
great site.bargin buys,2
"Bought - Chums | Mens | Fleece Lined Thermal Water Resistant Outdoor Trouser Pants | Charcoal from an Amazon Seller. They are faulty as there is excess lining in one leg making them difficult to get on. Tried to return them but they are stated as ""not eligible for return"". Their returns policy does not explain anything. This is against my statutory rights and I cannot get any explanation or  information from Amazon as to how to return them and get a refund. Spoke to Amazon on their CHAT line which is automated just to get confirmation that the goods are not eligible for return. Still don't know why. Will not be buying clothes from Amazon again.",0
"On time, well packaged and never really had any problems, thansk Amazon",2
"Although I love using the support, guys, the order drivers these past few months seem to be throwing stuff around a few damaged boxes upon arrival, items can get damaged which is my main concern.",1
"I have  bad experiences w.r.t. delivery in  US these days. A lot of my deliveries are getting lost or stolen - but I guess those are not Amazon's faults and they do reimburse, in those cases.  I am a great fan of Amazon. I have been using their services for more than 15 years now.",2
Very happy with them.  I go there first for nearly everything.,2
"Ridiculous. I‘m seriously thinking of cancelling my Prime Membership. Not one package arrives next day anymore. Many don’t arrive on promised day. I ordered a casserole, it said „3 left order soon“. Total lie. I ordered, package never arrived when guaranteed. It turns out they didn’t even have the item in stock! That’s why it never shipped. And now I‘m told as soon as it‘s back in stock it will ship. This is 3 days after delivery guarantee date. It was never in stock to begin with. Very disappointed. Not going to be part of this Amazon circus anymore.",0
Why has Amazon suddenly got so ridiculously more expensive than the shop. For example by Vileda active mop head £6.99 in Sainsbury's and everywhere else but £11.99 and more tab Amazon!  Shame on you cheat on people,1
You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,1
"Apparently my order is ""undeliverable"".  Ok no big deal but Amazon isn't going to refund me until 5 to 7 days after they get the parcel back.  What happens in the meantime if they lose the parcel ?  Terrible service.",0

"I use Amazon frequently - I rarely have  problems with them. My orders always arrive quickly and accurately. Whenever I need to contact their customer service I get through quickly and my issues are resolved promptly. You need to have proper expectations when working with a company this large. Their prices, product selection and convenience definitely make them the first choice for me when the need arises.",2
"Guaranteed delivery by 10pm. Get a notification at 7.20pm saying my item won't be coming tonight. The item was incredibly important hence same-day delivery yet Amazon couldn't care less. Amazon call themselves the World's most customer-centric company, yet honestly don't care. The compensation they offered me was an absolute insult too. Less than an hour's wage.",0

I contact amazon they say I download the app, without a phone How can I download app to call, I AM WITH OUT A PHONE MONEY LOST.",0
"I tried purchasing a laptop from Amazon (my first purchase ever from Amazon). I paid for fast shipping, but instead Amazon wanted to wait a week to ship my purchase ""because I am a new customer, they have to verify that it is really me"". I decided to cancel the order, because I verified with them over the phone that it was really me, but they have such a bureaucratic system regarding payments that I felt like I was just talking to a wall when speaking to their customer support. Overall, I think Amazon has a acceptable assistance in some aspects, so that is why they at least get three stars.",1
"I'm disabled and don't get out and about much.  I very much appreciate Amazon's range of goods, especially the books, and the value is tremendous.  I have found the most outlandish things on Amazon, such as a Flywhisk for Himself to use when walking the dog on the common in high summer.  If I want something, chances are I'll find it on Amazon. SO much easier than trying to make my way through crowds in my wheelchair!  I do most of my Christmas and Birthday shopping on Amazon now.  So easy, great prices and often postage free delivery.",2
Sometime the delivery can take longer than expected from retailers through Amazon and occasionally an item will run out of stock. However most of the time you receive a fast and efficient service. Recommended!,2
"The point of buying necessities before a hurricane is to receive them before hurricane arrives. I ordered Friday, and it doesn't even tell me where the package is, just that it will arrive tomorrow. But I wonder how because Tuesday hurricane will be here. Honestly as a Prime Member extremely disappointed.",0
good value and excellent service.  Can always rely on this company,2
"I thought I should put an opinion on here to balance all the angry ones. I've been a customer since 2005 so I have plenty of experience of dealing with them. Before this year, I never had any particular issue - of course, occasionally things were delayed, but the tracking on their website or external couriers tells you  the expected due date, so there are no surprises. The goods have been as described, with rarely the odd error which was corrected when they were notified.The reason I'm posting now is because this Christmas (2021) several things went wrong; two packages weren't delivered - they got stuck at customs and never reappeared - and three things I bought all broke (a phone, a smartwatch and a belt for bad backs). All were ordered from abroad, so returning the items was a little more complicated than usual and involved arguing in the local village post office, who had no idea what to do with the labels and forms. However, Amazon themselves couldn't have been more helpful. In one case they changed the return label for a different courier because DHL wouldn't collect the package (that's another story, 'computer says no'). I had to phone Amazon three times to sort things out, and they did everything to make it as painless as possible.Whether a large corporation should survive by gobbling up the opposition is another question...but Amazon are, in my experience, reliable and generally cheaper. That's why I'm still using them after all this time.",2
"Ordered a Thule Paramount Backpack 27l, Black on 15 July 2021 for $218.70On 21 July 2021, received a brandless fake brown coloured bag.Contacted Amazon customer service and their only answer is I have to arrange a return, and once the fake brown coloured bag has safely reached their warehouse, then they will refund me for their attempt to cheat me.The WORST experience ever, especially coming from the brand that is supposedly the richest in the world.",0

"I ordered a gift via Amazon as it was the last place that had the specific item in stock. I am not the least bit impressed that it is now due to arrive on the 18th. Similarly, an item I ordered almost a week ago, supposedly next day delivery, is now arriving on July 22nd. Amazon has seriously declined in standards. Constant delays with packages yet you charge people an extortionate amount for the below subpar service that is Prime. I was sure to double-check before I ordered and made both purchases way ahead of time. You should do more than offer a measly automated apology - I was not even emailed about the delay. Incredibly pathetic. ",0
"I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.",1
The product I bought was sent with very fast shipping. Nvidia 3080 is a great product and great graphics,2

I'm dealing with Amazon for a few years time and I can truly say that is the best place to buy anything what you need.,2
"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music assistance, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new assistance at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new assistance at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
"I like shopping through Amazon but this last usage might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the order really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for order people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, order person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1
"Find alot of items overpriced, claim to give you free order if you are an amazon prime member but actually it comes in the price of items. Will block you from reviewing their goodss without an explanation. Given 3 stars as they do deliver next day or when promised. some items can be awkward to return if not up to satisfaction.",1
Why has Amazon suddenly got so ridiculously more expensive than the shop. For example by Vileda active mop head £6.99 in Sainsbury's and everywhere else but £11.99 and more tab Amazon!  Shame on you cheat on people,1

"Have used Amazon on several occasions when buying things, have only good things to report about it! Never been disappointed with the service received!",2
"I use to swear by Amazon, but now I have zero respect for there business. The countless times my package instructions were ignored and left out in the open for all to see and steal. The countless times I reported fraud / scammers using their site for profit and not giving refunds or stealing peoples identities. They use foreigners from another Country who sometimes can't even speak clear English or won't escalate your call to a Manager or give a number to an American speaking person. They don't even have a Corporate number to contact or an email to file a complaint, but sure they love immediately taking your money out, but refuse to fix the problems plagued with their customer service and package delivery methods!",0
"Literally the biggest shambles of lies and rubbish, waited a full month for a refund, now fighting over a refund for postage even though the item sent was wrong, been promised a refund twice this week and now being told I have to contact the seller who’s ignored me for a full month.

They could not send me pictures of said damage nor tell me what was missing. I'm furious.",0

Great way to do business quick and easy,2

Guy big grin on his face when i said there tracking was good. Made a comment on notice i put on front door for friend in case i was not in. Delivery man wears bright fluorescent  yellow. Makes a trite comment and still grinning walks away. Now i have to see if i can repair car.     ,0
Amazon is becoming more expensive with little benefit. Shipping delays. Wrong items received all the time where it becomes my responsibility to return the item or pay for an item I never ordered. Walmart plus has been great their customer service is so much better to deal with. Bye amazon.,0
Amazing timing! Great customer service!,2
Yet again another purchase through amazon for delivery 3rd or 4th... by yodelAnd surprise surprise delivery running late now 5th to the 9th .Cancelled my amazon prime account because what's the point if its coming viaYODEL it's aways late or doesn't ever arrive .. very poor again Amazon Very poor .. another customer your going to loose.,0

"Well in June 14 2024 at 10:04pm an Ebike and lock for it where purchased on a fraudulent Amazon account WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Now unfortunately the account was made by a family member and they used my address for the order. When the items where delivered I returned it ASAP. NOW AMAZON DID send the refund for $418.74 back to my card however do to all the fraudulent activities going on in the world today I keep my card locked.  So I Did Not get my refund. Now I call Amazon and let them know what happened they are holding on to my refund now. All because the fraudulent account have more rights then using my card. I Gave Amazon ALL of the INFORMATION they asked for about the fraudulent account. Amazon keep emailing the fraudulent account like I have access to it. I don't I need that $418.74 more Jeff Bezos does. We live in a sick sick world. Amazon should verify with person that's name on the card is making the order before the order goes through. There should be a way to do that. I have had Amazon for years before this. I should have been asked by Amazon am I creating an new account and verify with me. All of that money they could make it safer if they cared to. Also, FIY the person who made the fraudulent account does not want me to get my $ 418.74 back. Is making codes for ordering on Amazon accounts and cards that hard to do? I would give 0 star if I could. ",0

This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0
"Amazon has the worst back office team, including customer service, verification, etc. The team has no idea about the rules and regulations, and because this team is working overseas, they can't assist with anything: Amazon CEO, probably you are stupid as your team.",0
"Generally, I like the Amazon operation. However, there is one part of the operation that causes me concern, and that is book supply. At times over the years, I have bought 'books', which turn out to be little more than 'cut and paste' exercises by some plagiarist. The latest one claimed it was published by Amazon and I suppose it was via the Kindle platform. Amazon should stop this practise, plagiarism stinks. I just wonder how many copyright laws have been broken.",2
"Excellent customer service if I have to return an item no problem I could go to whole foods or to ups refund the same day that I call customer service and no wait they answer the phone as soon as you call and sometimes they just say keep it and we will refund it back to your credit card ,customer service is 24/7 and I trust Amazon  and there getting bigger and bigger",2

"Fifth time in a row that a preorder has been delayed or changed. Says it comes out today but won’t ship til A MONTH (actually two months) after release, but yet it tells me it’ll be here Monday. I was also lied to by CS for the $10 coupon. Was also told ticket was escalated and will be shipped in 24 hrs (I highly doubt it). They tried to deflect asking where exactly it says it’ll show up on that day when it’s RIGHT ABOVE THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF THEM! I don’t what’s going on with their preorders but it’s gotten to be god awful. I get news that other people that order at the same get theirs but yet mine gets delayed. It’s getting to when I just cancel all my orders and don’t use you all as a place holder til I find it somewhere else. They just turning into a joke of a company",0

"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great interaction with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer support rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer support, is that if you ask a question about a item because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer support reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
"June 30th I ordered a hands free earpiece optional headset, I signed up for prime in order to get it before the 4th of July weekend.  That's the pitch rite??So, it takes a week to get my 'order', I opened it and it's not what I ordered!  Decided to go ahead and try using it because I was desperate for a hands free device.  It says refurbished on the outside, as soon as I try it on, the band that goes around your head is miss-shapen, very awkward and immediately comes apart from the main body. I called to straighten this out with Amazon, through two service reps that want me to return and have their wrong item received back before I can get a credit to re-order the correct product... I say bullcrap I signedup for Prime for this shxt, wrong product, bad service,  no deal!   ....I swear this shxt is fucjed up!  3rd Special service rep says she'll send a UPS driver to my door in next morning to pick up my repackaged product and I'll have a refund credit within an hour of the driver picking it up, I can reorder and life will be grand!!  5 days later I'm still coming home to this package in the door!!  This crazy story goes ON!!  I was disconnected after explaining this situation to a CS REP cause idt  she wanted to deal with it.  Called back...nice foreign gentleman, apologies and kindness, expedited a refund before getting the package back!!  All other ppl I spoke to were like ""oh we can't do that""!  What in the HELL???  He was happy to help but these other clowns  were like running into a brick wall!!  I just said everything will be great if this all happens!! 🙏🙏  today is the 16th of July , I'll be shocked if I can order and use that credit to get the right item I ordered within two days of reordering!!! Two stars is being generous for what I've been through In this ordeal!",0

Awful. Have spent tens of thousands with these clowns over the years and lately they do not care one bit about anybody. They don’t connect calls or bother calling you when you have issues they just randomly cancel your orders and don’t bother to deliver. My girlfriend caught an Amazon driver urinating in my garden last year and when told to stop he said he had nowhere else to go whilst holding it in has hand. Absolute joke of a company. And they really don’t care if they upset you as long as they take your hard earned money. You have been warned. Useless and way to big for their boots.,0
Almost every delivery has to be tracked down at a neighbors residence.  I won't be returning.A shame a good business model being ruined by people who dont seem to care shouldn't have to go under a car to retrieve a package.,0

"I'm thrilled with my recent Amazon clothing purchase! I ordered the CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.The fit is absolutely perfect, and I appreciate the accurate sizing chart provided by the seller. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and of high quality, making it a pleasure to wear all day. Plus, it's even better in person than in the pictures - the color is vibrant and hasn't faded after multiple washes.What truly impressed me was the attention to detail in the design. The stitching is impeccable, and I haven't encountered any loose threads or issues with the seams. This piece not only looks fantastic but feels well-made.The delivery was prompt, and the packaging was eco-friendly, which I appreciate.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts is now a staple in my wardrobe, and I've received numerous compliments whenever I wear it. I'll definitely be exploring more clothing options from this brand in the future. Highly recommend![Hafsat Abdulkadir]",2

They said they are in Audible and cannot help. They put me through to someone who says Amazon doesn’t have a complaints department?!

"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer assistance woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer assistance calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after order before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other goodss minutes after order.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1
"Amazon has stolen so much of my time, money, and energy from me and if I can do business with anyone else, I will. First, my account was deleted with no notice, along with all my wish lists that I spent hours organizing and adding to, all my account credits, all my order history, and all my gift cards, all my kindle books, and my 5 months of kindle unlimited free Bc I had just bought a kindle and signed up for unlimited. All gone. $500 and countless hours, all gone. I’ve spent HOURS on the phone with “customer service” and they simply can’t do sh** except offer me $5 which they still haven’t done. They can’t even do that! Ha! What a joke of a business. I had an account in Spain when I lived there and that’s the account I wanted to cancel. Not my US one. And the only reason I went to cancel it was Bc I got an email from Amazon music saying I had 3 months free based off a recent order I placed in AMERICA and when I went to use it, it said I couldn’t Bc There’s no amazon music in SPAIN. So obviously things were getting tangled and I wanted to get rid of Spain account so I could use amazon music on American account. I called amazon “customer service” before doing so trying to find out why that happened and if I cancelled nothing would happen to American account. They assured me accounts were not linked at all. So I cancelled. And 2 weeks later I get an email saying EVERYTHING is gone. And now it’s all apparently in cyber space and they can’t get it back. No emails, nothing in those 2 weeks verifying if I want to cancel my account. NOTHING. It’s just gone one day. Oh well. Nothing they can do. Amazon I hope you get lost in cyber space you piece of sh**. And then when I go to create a new account, it’s recommending me products based off recently sold items from my old account!! So how is it that they can’t recover my account but Amazon knows what I last bought in my old account?? WT*?! AND SO NOW, today, 3 months after this sh** went down, I received an Amazon gift card and went to add it to my account and get back on my kindle that I haven’t been able to read on much yet Bc amazon is a piece of sh**, and I immediately get locked out of my account. And to get back in, I need to send in a copy of my gift card reciept. I don’t have my gift card receipt Bc I didn’t buy my gift card bc it was a gift!!!!! AHHHHHH! And so I called “customer service” and they said it could be up to Tuesday until my account isn’t on hold anymore. Today is Friday. All I wanted to do was read a f****** book. F you amazon. F you. You owe me. I hope you get a million competitors and go out of biz. You don’t deserve to be in biz you piece of sh**.",0

Really good. Been using for years and has never let me down.,2
I contacted Amazon with a question as to whether any discounts were offered for veterans. The representative informed me that everyone receives a discount simply by purchasing because Amazon has the lowest prices around. She then proceeded to hang up on me. Amazon paid no taxes last year but they couldn't answer a single question,0
Visiting Amazon website is a pleasure--almost too tempting. It's easy to find what you are looking for & many items are delivered without charge. I like being able to find pre-owned books at bargain prices & being offered suggestions for what might interest me. Friends & relatives might tire of my enthusiasm if they were not as keen on Amazon as I am.,2

"I ordered rubber gloves and a puzzle the beginning of April, still nothing received as of June 17th, and when I applied for a refund it said “too late No refund can be applied”! Really? I paid for these and have been a prime member! I just cancelled my membership! You just lost my business!",0
Give your driver an iq test,0
Amazon prime is just becoming a joke. They make you wait home all day and continuously tell you it will be delivered by 10pm and then all of a sudden it’s got an unexpected delay and will be with you in a few days. It’s not the service you pay for and the customer service reps just say don’t worry you will get it in a few days. It’s not exactly the service I’m paying for when it’s meant to be next day or the day I’m choosing. More than 50% of my deliveries run into unexpected delays. They just make too much profit to care about losing customers nowadays.,0
"Amazon was always my go to, mainly because of the 2 day shipping. The shipment times have been very inconsistent for the past few months and a few items were canceled even though notifications were sent that the merchandise was out for shipment. Seriously considering not renewing my prime membership...",1
i have found something that amazon don't sell.i am a laryngectomee and i was after a larysnorkel freedom so i could go swimming again but i can't find on anywhere and even on the lary page i can't even pay for it so if amazon don't sell one then i give up but other wise its a decent firm to buy from,1

"I love amazon. I love the company, their customer service is great. Products are not always good and a lot of Chinese crap out there, so you have to be careful what you are buying but.... with all that the customer service is great and that’s why I will always be using them. I never had an issue getting my money back for something I didn’t like.",2
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
"I ordered two chairs on Amazon and used my Amazon credit card. When I posted a review about the poor quality the chairs were and how poorly Amazon’s customer service behaved, they refused to post my review. They’ve posted every other review that I’ve made whether it was favorable or unfavorable about the item. However when it was unfavorable to them, they refuse to post it. Be very careful with Amazon and their credit card. With any other credit card you can dispute a charge but with Amazon credit card they won’t even answer the phone. The chairs were of poor quality and very difficult to put together. I requested the seller replace only one of the chairs because that was the only one that was broken upon delivery. They responded immediately that they would make it right and then they ignored my next three requests. So I tried to deal with Amazon directly and submitted a dispute and they totally blew me off. They said they get back with me in a week and I never heard from them. I placed another dispute and same process. So then I tried through the Amazon credit card and I couldn’t even get a customer service rep on the phone. And there’s no way to dispute a charge online. I will certainly never use my Amazon credit card again. While Amazon has pretty much everything you could want, they can’t behave as though you don’t matter at all.",0
i had fun buying on amz. it is good.,2

"I am giving the third star reluctantly; I would rather only give 2 1/2 out of 5 stars, as my feelings about the company are 50/50.  As far as prompt order and fair pricing goes, Amazon is second to none.  Unfortunately, it is obvious that several of the reviews on the site are bogus, and until recently they would even allow trolls to write ""counter reviews"" to legitimate criticisms.  Where they really falter is in customer assistance.  I was locked out of my account for unknown reasons and I had to go through a whole rigmarole trying -- unsuccessfully -- to get back into it.  The belligerent, unapologetic operator I spoke to was acting as if I had put HIM out.  I couldn't take it anymore and disconnected the call.  Later, I was inexplicably able to access my account but it was no thanks to them.  They really need to clean up their act.  Goodness knows they can afford to.",1
"I have ordered many things from an Amazon, it was a wonderful experience which gives by amazon. I love to use for further bookings.I would recommended people to use amazon.",2
"I've used an amazon EC2 to run a small linux and didn't understand the free tier, asked for help and got an amazing reply very detailed and very fast!",2
"Very good service overall although I did have an issue about returning a DVD that I discovered was not suitable for UK players and it was never resolved. But overall, the service is swift even if the prices aren't always the cheapest. Product reviews are a useful guide and I know I can trust the delivery service.",2
"Excellent customer service, If ever I have an issue they resolve it ASAP. I am a prime customer and always happy with the deals and deliveries I get. Would highly recommend.",2
This is my 'go to' website- first stop Amazon!,2
"I like Amazon and have prime, shop often, love the shows and my kindle. Their customer service is horrendous. Some work from so and you hear children in the background and trying to interrupt, some barely speak English and some are just dumber than rocks. It generally takes several phone calls to get someone who can actually help. If I didn't like everything else about them, I would have ceased doing business with them years ago. I am so angry and frustrated with them right now I could scream. I have talked to 2 people, been on the phone a half hour and finally just hung up. I will have to try again when I get home from work. Maybe then I will get someone who speaks and understands English. I had to repeat everything over and over and over and they still couldn't get it. Incompetent!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Shocking customer services, get told one thing yesterday with email to confirm then today completely different information after item arrived brocken..Then I have to wait 5-7 days for payment to arrive in my bank.. and they have the check to blame the banks.",0
Great company but very confusing.  When is an item from Amazon and when is it not.  When can you get support and when are you stuck with no returns policy?That and they are killing mom and pop local stores.,1
"Prices are still fine but support going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer support and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"Amazon Prime: I bought a hedge trimmer from Amazon, unbeknown to me there was a 30 day trail period for Amazon Prime, something I neither asked for nor wanted, I have just discovered they have been taking money from my bank account every month since, without my permission or without me knowingly agreeing to this. The only way I found out was when I changed bank cards and they were trying to withdraw from the new one. I looked on there web site in order to stop this, no help whatsoever. Utterly disgusted and will never use them again. Please check your bank accounts to see if Amazon are stealing from you too.",0

"What an abysmal delivery service, I ordered a running belt and paid the extra to be delivered the same day, I’ve had an email stating it’s been delivered but it hasn’t been delivered to my door, just goes to show how bad of a company they are when they get stupid people who can’t read. Disgusting service and I’m probably not the only one that has had this experience.Well that’s me done for ordering anything off Amazon again, one unhappy customer",0
"Good company.lots of goodss.but would be better if they offered repeat customers a deal/break/discount.... i know people who have spent thousands of dollars and have not even been acknowledged....I just read that Amazon is approaching the ""trillion"" dollar mark in revenue.it's time to share the wealth people!!!!",1
Try to place an order and they tell me they will get back with me in 24 hours. Been a week. Is this the best this rich greedy jerk can do?,1
Amazon is pretty fine.It's useful for cheeper price and fine quality goodss.,1
"I had some pretty ordinary online orders before, and of course at last I jumped to Amazon, well the order came pretty quick, in around 5-6 days ( I am talking about international shipping) but the shipping fee is ridiculous! I bought two books and the shipping fee is more expensive than the books! -_-",1
"I don’t know what has happened to Amazon in recent months but it’s seriously gone downhill. From an exemplary service to poor. 4/10 items either lost or damaged. A small business would fold with those stats.So no more Amazon for me, simply not good enough. 😢",0
"I've used Amazon for years. Recently, I had an experience that proved to me that they are first class even when things go wrong. After dozens of transactions, I had two bad experiences with Amazon suppliers in the same week. Amazon's customer service was perfect. They resolved the problems fast - and at great expense to Amazon. I am a ""raving fan"" as a result.",2
"I never know what I've bought when I'm on Amazon. The last thing I purchased I clicked not to try an Amazon Prime Free Trial then on the next page it says 'We're giving you an Amazon free trial'. I don't want it! So then once I've proceeded to purchase my item, I look for how to cancel the Prime Membership and I can't find how to cancel it. I'm not even sure if I've got Prime or not now.",0
"I can't believe I am writing this - Amazon.com is SCAM. Do not order if you don't want to end scammed and blocked. I ordered a product with incredibly overpriced shipping with incredibly long duration. Right after, my account got suspended by Amazon and I can't login. They sent me some phishing-looking email(I tripple checked URL, it's genuine) to unblock my account - and now the best part - they want me to send photo of my credit card. LOL.",0
"Amazon is Ok, but it has some problems, and there are things that I don't like about this company. One time, I ordered something on Amazon, but my account got locked up for some reason because Amazon thought something suspsious is going on. I was able to unlock it, but it was a big hassle to unlock. I also had to call Amazon Customer Service. I also don't like how you can't order with paypal. I read that Amazon workers are working very hard and get paid very little, which is why one of the reasons I try to ignore Amazon. It's a very big company though, so it should be expected. I also one day ordered an item, but it did not arrive, but Amazon helped me. Overall, Amazon is ok, but try to avoid it if you can.",1
"I was literally delivered an empty box! The Amazon envelope was sealed but the suction hook box inside of it was completely empty. Amazon needs to up its game. These kinds of things are happening far too often. Packages going missing, running extremely late, and/or arriving empty. It's getting old. Most things are available at Walmart.com or Target.com and those stores offer 2 day shipping for free. I don't have to pay for the privilege of having things arrive late, damaged, or empty.",0
Their chat customer support is absolutely rubbish. They want you to keep typing the same thing over and over. I gave up in the end.,1
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
Amazon is great for getting items but it is the deliveries that let them down. My Amazon driver always just leaves parcels in weird places and then in the app it won’t tell me where they are.,1

"I have always shopped with amazon and I've never had any problems, acceptable value for money, far shipment until now.I place an order and my card was declined and I couldn't understand why so i ordered again and still it declined so I placed the order again but took an item out because I got one a little cheaper which I received the next day but when I checked my bank account amazon had taken the first 2 payments so I have been in touch with my bank and they told me my orders were cancelled and amazon is holding my money so they need to pay me, I have had several conversation with amazon who said to try my bank who may have it but the haven't, I feel like I've been fobbed off so I'll have to wait till Monday.

The best return policy. Stands behind prime members.Offers discounts and gift cards to solve problems.What more can you ask for.Don't listen to the cry babies.,2
"Amazon: When placing order, CHECK if from Market Place Seller or Amazon .. Free Shipping is not Free",1
I pay for prime. However I am sick of these Chinese sellers seaping through they say they are UK based but that isn't true! Have to wait ages for items to arrive from China which isnt stated on the onset. This is dishonest to some degree. After orders the time frame often changes to longer. This is not the reliable Amazon I started out with.,1

Revolutionary.  Thank you for changing the world in favor of consumers.,2
What a joke!!! 2/2 times left hustled without a product. Locked out of my account...no help canceling items...no accountability. This monopoly will be short lived. Too many people waiting for ANY company that will do the same crap with less the hastle. Dont waste your time or money.,0

Power SaversDespite being fraudulent Amazon have listed five power saving devices on their web pages.  The extravagant claims for these devices are based on incomplete knowledge of anything to do with electrical power consumption measurements.. Save 50-75% on your Energy Bill  what utter utter frauds.  Amazon of course  don't make only sell them as a drop shop.  M E Denton Lincoln UK,1

"Extremely poor!  I can only add to the reviews already placed on trust pilot!My advice to any customer purchasing from Amazon make sure you order the correct sizing (I realise that can be difficult at times due to difference in garment sizing) Also the items clothing displayed on Amazon ARE NOT always identical to the material , quality  shown.let’s hope all is well and fits whatever you purchase as once making a return you could be waiting up to 3 weeks for this to process and to show in your Amazon account . I made so many calls it was unbelievable to ask them to refund my account . Although they assured me by email they had processed and credited my account there was no evidence of this Contacted my bank for suppprt, finally a refund Avoid ordering clothing if you can Extremely poor service I would give no stars if that was possible on this forum",0
Managed to sort out my refund for a product quickly,2
"They are about the worst thimf ever most corrupt idiotic people I’ve ever come in contact with. Jeff Bezos is a narcissist and let all the money he made go to his head. The site is inoperable for the most part and when it is operable and you can actually place an order don’t expect to get what you ordered or get it when you expected it. You will get the wronf items with no customer care to back it up . The customer care chat is only available in the app and it malfunctions. Though it malfunctions, the people who respond also have noAccess to actually assist with anything . They just want to call you and waste moreTime. Who would do this except a narcissist ? Who would have rules like this ? Also in spite of all the times their company is messed up in other accords, the weird thing was my account was blocked because of me using it. So I used to a few other times before and got poor service so I quit using it but someone wanted a gift card so I sent them one and the account was LOCKED because they thought it was fraud even tho it came fromMy IP address. So I do I like chat like I say they people there are of no use they just want me to call. This was for a friends birthday . Time is sensitive in this regard . Wake up",0

"I have nothing bad to say about Amazon.com.  I have a prime membership which means that for about $80/year, I and 4-5 other family members have free 2-day shipping for an entire year.  You can see that if you divide that fee between everyone, that it becomes quite reasonable.  I have a Kindle, and I absolutely love it - I no longer have to find more bookshelving for my expanding library.  Amazon is a real winner!!!",2

Amazon delivered my package on the wrong porch! 😤 Now I have to go next door and look like a PACKAGE THIEF!! 🤦🏽‍♀️,1
"Purchased a knee brace from amazon and was asked for a review, so I reviewed it telling them that it was a good brace and much cheaper than a hospital fitted device. They rejected my review for some nebulous reason thus wasting my time. It's not the first time I've received a rejection for a product review and makes me wonder what they are hiding. Are they selling this brace illegally? Another aspect of their product reviews is what I consider false reviews. I bought two different thumb drives which proved to be of much less capacity than described yet had good reviews. I verified the drive capacity with f3probe yet their reviews state the drive capacity is as claimed. This alone is two strikes against ethics. Amazon blows.",0
They don't even deserve a 1⭐ as far as i am concerned.Years of being with Amazon what made them think it's okay to start stealing from the customer and then lie for the seller? The truth is they only ripped me off twice but that was enough to make me go somewhere else. Nobody likes to be ripped off.They stole a total amount of around $23.00 no big deal right? But it is wrong to take money that doesn't belong to you. I tried calling and told them i had proof but that made no difference in the matter. I was wrong and they were right. Best advice i can give to you is try Etsy. They actually send you the product without ripping you off but still becareful no matter where you shop and always look at the reviews before you buy anything.,0
"I find it very hard to understand in relation to an organisation. As large as Amazon cannot deliver one basic item. This item has cost me over £1500 and like for the fact that they couldn’t deliver on two separate occasions and Me persistently doing chase calls to get it. Redelivered is absolutely outrageous if Amazon wish to advertise and put items on their webpage to do it, they intend to sell, and if they know that that item is going to be of some conceptive heavy and they need to facilitate that it shouldn’t be down to the customer to get through to the point whether they’re gonna get cancelled and then get a refund absolutely disgusting. I think Amazon need a seriously look at the logistic all operation because it doesn’t function doesn’t work on top of which I don’t think really at the end of the day that are doing the deliveries need to pay attention to the information that’s been sent. I sent information directly onto the Amazon website given specific instructions and they were not followed very basic. We had to do was open the back garden door. The garden door was left open and then leave it there  Quite simple, but clearly not simple enough very poor service. ",0
"I recently ordered some things from Amazon and I didn't realize my account was short and they charged another card in my wallet and came within 1.59 of bouncing my rent check. This would not have been necessary if I had been contacted before it would have been paid for by another source, but I wasn't contacted prior to their going ahead with this. I've had a rough year, been in the hospital 3 times and the second time had my right leg amputated below the knee. Bought all the hardware from Amazon. Wheelchair, walker, house ramp and then a second walker. These people need to realize we are people too. I'm very disappointed in Amazon at the moment. The worst part is they don't even seem to care.",0
I think Amazon could take a leaf out of Ebays ebook when it comes to navigation/listing/cataloging etc. It's irritating to browse.,1
"They claim to have shipping preference options that are not available. I often choose ""1 day shipping"" only to find out that my order is arriving in 5 days. This is not a pandemic issue, as this has happened before.  Customer service will claim that nothing is wrong, and that it never said 1 day shipping, but believe me, I can read and I know what it said when I ordered. I don't even care if it's delayed, just don't pretend I didn't choose 1 day shipping - it's insulting to be gaslighted like that. Scummy company, and when the pandemic is over I will likely cancel prime and go back to shopping local where people are honest.",0
Sometimes the product delivery times are to long. The Geargamers mousepad arrived ok.,2

"I only gave 1 star as thats tge only option they dont deserve any stars . Ive been using amazan for years but they have seriously gone down hill , 3 times now no show .. parcels , first two excuses were item unable to be delivered damaged , took 3 weeks for a refund. Now they say its been delivered and they handed it to resident .. well my ring door bell says differently ??? There was no delivery at all .. what a sham amazan is now thats it for me amazan can do one ....",0
I joined Prime and ordered 2 seperate products one took 7 days to arrive and the other 5 days not the next day delivery promised by Amazon. Furthermore their response was odd a long email in an English I don't know and condescending. Little wonder the ASA are investigating this,0
"Sorry to say that 3´rd party sellers hide behind the fact that Amazon does not want to be involved in their sales and the quality of it. Amazon, in my view act similar to a fence. When someone sells something so ordinary, such as the quality of a CD film, how can you as a private buyer stop them from selling more junk to the public ?This type of sellers don´t want any ratings, so from there they are protected from further scam. When the item had been sold for a low price the you completely loose in the transaction as you don´t want to be involved in a return fight where you absolutely don´t know wher it will stop. Amazon gives strong indication that they do not care selling such low quality items as it is impossible to contact them and with no rating activated for the seller, there is not much you can do and impossible to warn others.",1
Bought some fine/ordinary goodss,1
I order most of my stuff from Amazon and they don't let us down.,2
"Purchased a product called ""JB Weld"" its a repair kit for reapplying a rear view internal car mirror. It was purchased on Amazon from a company called STREET BARGAINS To be blunt it's no good and a waste of money so dont buy it. I used some rapid glue which did the job just fine. I should have purchased it on eBay as easier to get a refund then on Amazon",0
"My usage with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the order company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
"I purchased a printer from Amazon and they sent me a beach chair instead and refuse to honor the price I purchased the printer for or to even investigate the fraud. Their answer is to just refund the money and for me to repurchase the printer at a much higher cost, over $700 more.",0

"I wish I could give Amazon 5 stars, but I have had some very frustrating customer support usages with them recently. I recently bought a remote control and I ended up with a used remote that someone must have returned. I bought it through Amazon directly and not even a third-party seller. I learned my lesson there. I then had to talk to customer support and the person I spoke with did not really understand what I was even talking about. It was incredibly frustrating. Amazon has great prices and they ship fast, but they are a massive company that just doesn't get it right all of the time.",1
I ordered 2 pair of support knee high hose because my legs were swelling and my doctor told me to get some support hose to wear and that would probably help my swelling. I called and got a representative to help me figure out what I needed. I can't remember his name but he was so nice and helped me decide what I needed. He helped me from the very beginning and to the end of my order. I couldn't of done it I don't think if he hadn't of helped me. I would order from them any time that I needed any  thing. There knee highs were very nice and they are working very good for me.,2
Ordered many items have found site is slightly dearer than eBay but has the excellent service of always delivering.,2
This company does not consider the customer. They sent me an item on a phone that I did not buy. I returned it and instead of issuing the refund to my credit card they credited it to a Gift Card without my consent to force me to spend the 270.00 dollars on their page .Get out of this company. Walmart already has one-day shipping service.When I spend the gift card money I close the account and the credit card. No more Amazon.,0
"As a longtime customer of Amazon.com, I have mixed feelings about my recent interactions with the company. While I can't deny the consistently decent quality of their goodss and assistances, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall interaction.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of goodss available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home decents, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the goodss I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming interaction less appealing. It feels like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for every additional assistance, making it harder to justify the extra expenses.",1
"Amazon's onboarding process as a potential seller is horrible! For a couple months I have been trying to list items. Amazon has sent me emails numerous times that my account is verified and I am ready to list.However, when I try to list (via adding a product not sold on Amazon) I get this, ""Problem with your Seller AccountYou’re currently unable to add or edit listings because either the credit card on file is invalid or the credit card is in the process of validating, which could take up to 24 hours. Please ensure that you have a valid credit card uploaded in Account Settings.""I have quadruple checked my credit card info matches my legal identity. That everything matches up 100%. Not only that I use this card on a daily basis. I also use it with my Amazon prime account (under the same account) often! But, am considering dropping my prime account based on this experience.I keep getting canned responses that don't help and have requested phone calls more than once and not received one.Absolutely horrible!",0
"I think that these are the main core main issues of Amazon that makes Amazon anti-customer friendly.1) Want to use Amazon Prime Now? Sadly, you don't get free shipment, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour shipment. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for shipment. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's. We're expected to watch content on our phones but we can't control what we do, even though membership cost is ridiculous.",1

"Gave Amazon Japan another go for a neck care device . Here's the quick take : On the plus side, the shipment was quick and they also allow you to deliver to a local score which is very convenient. On the downside the device was quite porly packaged and I'd have returned it if it wasn't for the pain with getting in touch with customer assistance . However I have to say the device works well and for less than ¥3,000 I am pretty satisfied ",1
"Amazon is excellent online store, and super servies !!!!",2
"As a website it is acceptable. But if you're a sellers you will have a lot, I mean A LOT of problems, and you will surely need to consider that with a support (that answers only via email per 1 business day+ not on all questions you have. So you will repeat'n'repeat it forever, until you already will post something.) Very hard to understand how the whole tables , codes, etc work, because you can find it on some japan forums, but not on the official site.",1

Clearly, this is an internal policy to avoid responsibility. I am a 78 year old widower, with cancer. I live alone and need the generator to insure that my home medical services work.

"I love Amazon, for the assistances they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the goodss or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' usages. Typical corporate America. No matter how many fine things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1

I pay for prime and its normally fine but recently deliveries have gone missing or been broken they also have proved they don't check sizes from third party sellers as I bought an item listed as UK large and received Chinese large which is basically a UK small. Customer support have been shocking and rude.,1
"Please don't trust them.I had an email as they done a mistake and charged me 3x times in total for prime they will return money as their mistake.Comes an email confirming it.Then no money When you try to speak. Advisers cut the call and drop out the chat.Saying they don't care and is jot their problem.I've added email in.Hope that person sees who said conformed and then refused to answer.Hello,This is KLEI, the associate who assisted you earlier. Thank you for the warm approach you gave on our conversation.I looked into your account and see the $12.99 charge you mentioned was processed for your Amazon Prime membership renewal after the free trial has ended.I've confirmed your Amazon Prime membership has been canceled.You'll receive a refund of $350.73 for the Amazon Prime membership fee.

Their free deliveries to Spain are a boon,2
good value and excellent service.  Can always rely on this company,2
The reviews were very helpful in determining which material to buy.,2
Not even worth one star i set up Amazon to order some stuff for my new house £600 ordered then they send me a message to say account is on hold im guessing as i paid on my credit card in my maiden name so cancelled my order and not sent the money straight back now moving in without a bed for my daughter and customer care call was rubbish not even a manager to speak to i should have stuck to Ebay never lets you down unlike this.,0
easy to use for those who doesnt know about tech,2
Amazon always delivers what I order correctly and quickly!,2
"Good to see the reviews here are telling the story....1* ...ishBought lights, via the dreaded platform that I had noted the younger generations really, really do not approve of...They didn't refund me for the no -show delivery. Time, headspace, blood pressure expenditure we could all do without: had to forensically persist to track down an actual number to call, spoke to a sarcastic ne'er do well who really, really enjoyed showing he could not give a ....For about an hour we were on the call.  He could've refunded me 100 times during that time but he enjoyed stringing out the torture blaming Lepro as a 'scam-seller'.Months later no refund showing at my endIf they take rel. small sums from millions  - banking on us not bovvering - they make - yes - millions....for nada but wasting our time...Lepro blaming Amazon: and yes, vice versa #yawn#avoidlepro #avoidamazon #besafe",0
Ordered something on prime for delivery yesterday. Said it would delivered by 10pm and was on the phone to customer service who might I add are very rude and spoke to me like I was stupid. Offered no resolution to my issue. Take money for prime but don’t fulfil their and when it comes to delivering. ,0
I love it......,2
"I have bought pots'n'pans, books, kitchenware and shelving through Amazon....they are fast and reliable!  A go to site for all my wants!",2
amazon is going to s**t with every progressing day,1
"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer support at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1
I love shopping at Amazon...but don’t try to contact them..I got a scam call today saying a charge of over $700 was being added to my account..I tried comtacting Amazon with their form..”call me”...that didn’t happen...”chat with advisor” ...couldn’t do that either..no shows..they are acceptable at collecting the money but customer assistance...no show.  So disappointing..not that they care...too busy raking the cash in.  Not the first time ...I should have known not to waste my time.,1

"I've been using Amazon for the last 5-6 years and been a Prime member for 4.5 years. I've been ordering pretty much everything from them including small household items, books, a 55-inch TV, baby crib, etc. I wasn't disappointed so far. They are very professional on shipping and disputes. They often deliver early and I can return things easily with no charge.  Sometimes when I call them for a dispute, they right away offer a refund without even asking the item back. I had to convince them a couple of times not to fully refund me, because I still keep the item. It sounds ridiculous but that is how they handle disputes :).",2
"I have always shopped with amazon and I've never had any problems, decent value for money, far order until now.I place an order and my card was declined and I couldn't understand why so i ordered again and still it declined so I placed the order again but took an item out because I got one a little cheaper which I received the next day but when I checked my bank account amazon had taken the first 2 payments so I have been in touch with my bank and they told me my orders were cancelled and amazon is holding my money so they need to pay me, I have had several conversation with amazon who said to try my bank who may have it but the haven't, I feel like I've been fobbed off so I'll have to wait till Monday.

I have recently purchased an item from Amazon and the delivery  date was around 3 weeks which i thought was acceptable. 3 weeks passed so checked on my account and it stated item might be lost? Contacted seller and was sent an email to confirm my delivery address? I replied this have been provide when i purchased the item. By mirical a week later the item turned up in very poor state. To my surprise the item was sent from China which i had no knowledge of. I contacted Amazon  and i was told that the info was there but only if you gone through all the literature which i think is deceaving and should have been highlighted with the description of the item.Amazon said will look into this but it's  dissaponting and a bit late for me.Be aware of this,0
"Usually good, but I've had delayed shipments quite a few times. Considering that I pay over $100 per year for Prime shipping, that shouldn't happen. Still, Amazon is #1 in its field just based on the variety of things you can find on it, things that many other online retailers don't have.",2

I ordered a EGO mower via Amazon.com ($5300 purchase). The shipping company the seller used refused to deliver the mower to my home and it was sent back to the seller without ever being in my possession. Amazon has a A-Z guarantee that states they will refund your money if an item is not delivered. Today I got an email from Amazon stating that I am not eligible for the a-z guarantee and therefore will not refund my money. No explanation of why they say I am not eligible.   I have been a loyal customer for many years and recommended them to many of my friends. No longer will I do any business with them and will tell my friends to not use them also. I would rather spend more and pay shipping on items than give them one more cent of my money.,0
Customer service SUCKS!  I have had 3 items break in the last 6 months.  Amazon makes you jump through hoops to return an item.  They DO NOT make clear who I am buying a product from as some item are a 3rd party seller.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR 3rd PARTY SELLERS as amazon does nothing to resolve issues with defective items.  They make it virtually impossible and jump through so many hoops hoping you will just give up.  They sell inferior Chinese built items that break down LONG before they should.,0
"After many years a loyal Customer it has now come to the point had enough of poor customer support.Ordering and order is excellent,but anything goes wrong with a appliance after thirty days it’s a uphill battle.Remember your contract is with Amazon ,not the manufacturer,but Amazon keep telling its not there problem.If it’s a third party ,then just give up as Amazon are not interested.There’s no way to complain , all emails that used to work bounce ,the agents won’t let you complain.So as soon as my refund that I’ve been waiting for 5 week arrives , if it ever does ,I’m closing my account.",1
"At Amazon.com, I am a valued customer and receive respectful customer support and support. If I buy an item for $ 1, I can leave a review for this item and for the seller.After I bought two well-written, interesting books with an absolutely ordinary cover (the books fell apart) from Amazon.de, I wanted to write a customer review. My rating was rejected on the grounds that I did not meet the minimum order value. The minimum order value is 50 + EURO in one year. I was shocked.Amazon.de customer support stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1
My parcel and books come quickly thank you,2
Amazon is just as worthless as eBay. And what's worse is just like eBay they are cowards and hide behind the fact that they make it very difficult to try to contact them. They say they have easy email but I had to search the web to try to find it and still couldn't find it. Goodbye Amazon not going to waste any more of my money at your store.,0
I don’t like Amazon because they advertise things for sale that are out of stock. I had a very bad experience just over a year ago when I bought a book. Like many people I ticked free postage.BEWARE! If you click Free Postage you will inadvertently sign up for Amazon Prime.I did not know I had done this until I had to change my bank card because of a security scare. I then had a phone call from Amazon saying they could not process my Amazon payments. I was horrified and thought it was a scam. I then rang the real Amazon and they told me I had signed up to Amazon Prime. I was appalled and cancelled my Amazon Prime account.I gave the card number of the expired card which was safe to do.  I then received a phone call from BT saying my call to Amazon had cost £80.BT refunded half of this as a goodwill gesture. Beware of signing up to Amazon Prime if you click Free postage. I lost several payments of £7.99 and £40 so lost about £80. Disgusting company who are conning and tricking people into signing up for Amazon Prime. I tried to download a kindle app the other day but discovered I could only use the app to read a book if I buy the book off Amazon. No chance!Other thing I hate about them: you can’t use PayPal.,0
"I purchased a $10 CPU cooler, the seller was Amazon themselves. I should've gotten the fan itself, thermal paste & backplate, but all I got is the fan.I was suspicious the second I realized I just got a fan, but I thought, maybe it's supposed to be like that (it's not) and then I applied thermal paste on my cpu, and tried screwing the cpu cooler down, but it didn't work. I need the backplate to screw it down.There is no option to actually contact support, I can either get my money back or a new product, both options require I send the product back. I do not get compensated for the expensive thermal paste of my own that I used.I'm writing this part a while later, I have sent the package back to where it came from, you can check on dhl.se this number 7135563356I also have a receipt where it said I'm returning this from DHLThey took a while to update anything, for the first nine days, it said I haven't even dropped of my package yet but I have. I got my money the next day.Don't give Amazon the benefit of the doubt like I did, just buy from websites with convinient money back policies. I told the manufacturers about Amazon too.What should Amazon have done: Send either a whole product, the missing parts, or give me my money back, without requiring me to ship the item back.",0
It is a good and easy website,2
prices very decent shame some items come not very well packed and have to go back replacement and refund policy very decent shame i have to use it often,1
Totally rotton website.Customer service is a joke.India people who dont know anything but I guess jobs are cheaper to pay them than americans.Ban accounts for using a amazon gift card.They ask you to send proof of prime card used to sign up.Try to explain that it was a virtual card used and no longer have it after spending.Cant get it through their thick skulls.So they ban and keep all account money.Never again will I buy from them. Oh and my girl also had an account support person changed her email and stole the account.Called and they never called back.AMAZON= FRAUD and emails are all no-reply.Calling is a waste of time.,0
Got my items as described on their site. Happy customer :),1
I am not happy nor sad. I bought LR44 cell.,1

"Its better to buy things in other specific online shops. After being a loyal customer of Amazon and after having bought so many products with them, their customer service and customer protection has become very bad.

"The customer service is non-existent. The on-line help desk infuriatingly loops you to a particular item. Hey wake up amazon sometimes a question is a process question NOT LINKED TO AN ITEM!  So you call and you a semi-English speaker whose coworkers are laughing and fooling around so loudly you have to bellow over them to be heard, their scripting says ‘let me check’ they don’t check they have ZERO problem solving skills and answer, “we don’t have that” no noun to follow so I wonder that what? That option? That process? That brain cell to ascertain what the customer is asking? Wholly crap for the billions of dollars Amazon must make THIS is the sum total of effort put into customer service?

"Amazon is always misplacing my packages and their only solution to something I actually needed is to refund my money or replace the item!! What are they even doing to the shipment people or shipment support?! Recently, USPS, the worst package shipment support in this country was tasked to deliver my air conditioner. Why is beyond me, because even the USPS rep was surprised by this. Amazon customer support provided no empathy or solution. I called USPS and they themselves had no idea where the package 📦 was which was both bewildering and upsetting!!! Amazon customer support no longer seems to follow-up, so I figure, shipment people are ripping them off because they know Amazon will just simply replace the item and that somehow everything is supposed to be right in my world?! I'm a pretty honest person, and that just doesn't sit well with me. Especially when it's hot as all get out in my apartment and I expected to have what I ordered on the date that it was shown to delivered. What made matters even worse; all of the accessories arrived on time!!!! ",1

It shows how difficult it is for a women trying to date a man on a dating web site, especially when most men tend to block after a first meet.The author appears to have had first hand experience and you tend to feel sorry for the women who is the subject in the book and the problems she has with her daughter.I would therefore thoughly recomend this read.",2

Always got what I need or want at a good price. Excellent value and delivery times,2
Cannot rely on Amazon for delivery anymore. They advertise a buy it now and get the item by a certain day. This NEVER happens anymore and they blame the seller or the delivery. Amazon has gone downhill and is has lost me as a customer.,0
Amazon are the best shopping experience ever. Their customer service is second to none and you can virtually buy anything from here and always at a cheaper price.,2
"Amazon has everything, gets it to you fast and coordinates shipments from multiple vendors. I wish their reviews and product info were more extensive, but that's a reflection of individual vendors.

"Amazon Prime member for many years.  Getting very disillusioned with Prime shipment/promised shipment dates. Prime promises same day, next day, two day shipment depending upon the goods you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some goodss due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all goodss can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised shipment vs. actual shipment issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the shipment date stated/selected when I order.  In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a goods and get an HONEST, REALISTIC shipment date than continue to get notifications that the goods I've ordered is delayed.  In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original shipment date.  Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.  In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.  Go figure...",1
"I paid 10 Euro for expedited delivery and they have sent my order with regular delivery which by the way takes at least a week, so I won't be getting my items for over 7 days. After talking to support for over 40 minutes, they issued a refund for shipping. Same thing has happened about 2 months ago.... Horrible experience and I won't order from them anymore. They are either scaming people on shipping fees or have incompetent underpaid workers. How can you screw up shipping out a product when that's your only job?",0
I would not even give them even one star. Since the virus thing they are only doing chats . These pples are not taking their job seriously more like a play ground full of kids not doing jobs correctly. They pass u from or person to next in space of 20 mins I chatted to 6 pples . None of then had a clue and could not be asked to read perious notes. Forever repeating uelf and they tire blind eye to their online delivery rime star stating what ties which I missed my delivery. I he been buying from these company fr time and once I get my orders I will be deltin my account and shopping else where like eBay or etc. Ths company don't have respect fr customers and too greedy fr money to the point they turn bind to their own B's.

I am literally on the phone every week with Amazon customer service because one thing or another didn't get delivered or it was delivered to the wrong place or it's being held at US post office service. Whenever I call weekly by the way I get the most ignorant clearly non-educated people answering the call who don't know how to do anything but say oh I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I swear to goodness if one more Amazon person says I'm sorry to me I am going to lose my cool! I ordered pillows in June they never arrived they sent me new pillows which said were delivered but when you looked at the tracking the carrier just picked them up and that was the end of the tracking. So of course I had to do all the work I have to cancel the order I have to reorder them at a more expensive price because it's now been 2 months in the price is gone up I swear to God I am so flipping sick of Amazon and they're terrible policies and the fact that they really don't give a crap about whether you get your stuff or not. The policies they have in place are just ridiculous people are stealing my stuff so I have to cancel my order and reorder it again and they're stealing my stuff by not delivering it to me so it's not like somebody stealing it off my mailbox no it's never getting delivered half the time honestly I would not join Amazon and I think I'm going to cancel my whole thing because I'm sick of it I'd rather go to stores and wait at least then I get what I want and I don't have people lying to me I cannot stand when people lie and I think that's how they train their customer service just lie to them just lie to them it'll be fine go ahead and lie and say you're sorry eventually they'll be worn down and they'll do whatever you want. You know it would be different if they actually needed individual customers I feel like but they don't so they don't give a crap,0
"I normally use Amazon for everything as it’s so easy and convenient. However, my opinion has been significantly reduced. I recently had a relatively serious issue with Amazon so I contacted them about it, they tried fobbing it off on a reason that I knew it absolutely was not because the likelihood is a thousand to none. So I told them, and they couldn’t give me a sufficient answer to my problem and that it was passed on to the ‘specialist’. In other words, they best come back and resolve this issue efficiently and to my expectations otherwise I will definitely reconsider the next time I shop with them.",0

"What is happening with Amazon and some of their Vendors? I filed a complaint about a product that was arriving by 8 pm and never showed up. When I look at the tracking number it is with some unknown shipper and has not even been shipped even though the amazon site says shipped. The product was coming from Alaska, but really China. Checked the odd tracking number and it hasn’t even shipped from China who knows when of id it will ship.I did online chat and was transferred 5 times to different people, didn’t ask to be transferred and had to start all over again. I contacted the vendor asking where is my product or money only to get an email , Hi, stay safe message. Because I contacted the vendor a second time asking where is my item Amazon says I have to wait 48 hours for a response before they can do anything. Doesn’t matter I already contacted the vendor once before. They don't care that my money is gone and the product is way over due. Amazon may contact the vendor, maybe file an A to Z complaint and another month goes by and Amazon has my money. I don’t know if I have to contact Amazon again to make this happen. Amazon could have read the complaints from all the other people who have not gotten the product, but chose not to. Amazon has removed this item from their site like the other 2 items I had the same issue with.  I told Amazon I would file a dispute with my bank and they said,  go ahead file a dispute with you bank. This is the third time something like this has happened. What has happened to customer service? What happened to Amazon backs their items? Why is Amazon taking customer money so quickly for items before they are shipped? Do they not trust their third party vendors? Amazon is not the Amazon they use to be.",0

Sometimes not the cheapest but Amazon never fails to have excellent products at excellent prices.  I love the fact that when you buy directly from them and the product is not to your satisfaction you can send it back for free.  I made the mistake of buying Dr. Marten boots from ebay instead of Amazon and because they were too big had to pay a whopping £7.50 to return them.  I was gutted and vowed never to buy shoes from ebay again!  Amazon all the way!,2
"Amazon A big shout outI would like to thank your customer service team.  They helped me with an issue on an order that was never received.

"What's the point of you? 99% of my orders are not delivered when you say they will be. The drivers deliver when they feel like it. Customer service is useless, they just ghost you. Bunch of imbeciles. Shocking is an understatement. What the hell are you doing?",0
"Horrendous. Prime is a joke, extortionate price and now films have adverts. Just shocking with the amount they make. Rubbish service.",0
I would not even give them even one star. Since the virus thing they are only doing chats . These pples are not taking their job seriously more like a play ground full of kids not doing jobs correctly. They pass u from or person to next in space of 20 mins I chatted to 6 pples . None of then had a clue and could not be asked to read perious notes. Forever repeating uelf and they tire blind eye to their online delivery rime star stating what ties which I missed my delivery. I he been buying from these company fr time and once I get my orders I will be deltin my account and shopping else where like eBay or etc. Ths company don't have respect fr customers and too greedy fr money to the point they turn bind to their own B's. Iill b contacting watch dog and local omboman,0
"They have their ups and downs but they aren’t the worst company in the world. When I need certain things I can’t find elsewhere, Amazon holds a spot as the ‘fallback shop’.",1
"I've ordered from Amazon countless times, most of the time I do get the packages. Sadly now and then they fail to deliver the items, and just recently they've failed once again to deliver.To say that it's annoying is an understatement. Clearly they really need to improve on this. 3 stars because they have previously managed to deliver items, but also failed to deliver items.",1
"Amazon Pickup Mix-Up 1/3/22I had two packages that were supposed to be shipped out to UPS, one of which was an Amazon return and the other of which would not go through. The package that did not go through contained photos I needed to get developed for a music festival I took pictures for. I owed the organizer images, as I was on the media team for the event. These were to be sent to Georgia. I called UPS to fix the issue with the latter package, and then the following day, someone came to pick up a package. I gave him the film in error, thinking UPS must have solved my issue, only to realize that he came for the Amazon return, not for the film.Calls 1/3/22Following this realization, I proceeded to call UPS, whose representative told me they could do nothing, and bounced me to Amazon, whose representative also told me they could do nothing. I asked her if they could leave something that would let the Amazon shipping center in Virginia (where it was headed) that when they got the package it should be returned to me. She said that Amazon had no such system and I would need to wait until the [package made it to the facility. I asked her if she could put me through to the facility in Virginia so I could tell them myself. She said she had no such ability. I asked if she could transfer me to someone who could contact them. She explained that there was no such person. I thanked her for her time and called UPS again. This time, UPS said they would issue an interception order to stop the package from arriving. I thanked the representative and concluded the call, feeling relieved.Calls 1/4/22The following day, I awoke to find a message from my Amazon app which stated that a refund was applied to my account for my return. Frustrated, I called Amazon again and spoke to someone about the issue. I explained the situation and asked if she could get the package sent back to me. She explained that she was sorry, but the person who spoke to me last gave me false information. There was, in fact, a system of tickets that could be created to notify a shipping facility of a package that should be returned to the sender upon arrival. She told me that since the package arrived at the facility that morning, it has likely been opened, inspected, and the contents thrown away without me being notified. I explained to her that this was a departure from what the other representative told me and that the pictures on the film were for a music festival and were irreplaceable She apologized and said she would file a ticket anyway, just in case, but that I should expect to not get my pictures back. Despite the package being there already (complete with a shipping label and tracking number to aid in its location), she said it would take up to 15 days for the facility to even view the ticket, meaning my package would likely be long gone. She sighed and stated that things ""could have been very different"" if the first Amazon representative gave me the correct information. I asked why the system takes 15 days when packages are delivered sometimes in less than 2 days. She did not have an answer to this question. Frustrated, I explained that what was originally a mixup due to my lapse of memory has become the imminent loss of irreplaceable photo work and film rolls which were valued at a combined $45. I asked who I should speak to to get compensation for this incident in the event that I never get my film rolls back. She said that there was no such department and that Amazon would not offer compensation because the rolls were no Amazon products. I thanked her for her time and concluded the call. Less than 10 minutes later, I called Amazon support again. I was determined to do everything I could to get my package back. The third representative told me some of the information the second representative gave me was incorrect. She explained that once the package is received by the facility, it is not opened immediately but is rather thrown in a pile with packages to be sorted. According to her, it could take the aforementioned 15 days to find the package and a whole month to return it to me if they succeeded in locating it. She too, however, stated that there was a chance I would never receive it, before doubling back and sending me an email that stated I would get a confirmation email when the package was found.AftermathI am beyond frustrated with Amazon Customer Service. I was given a wealth of false information and every representative had something different to say than the last. No information was consistent and I have barely been given any real help. I am now gearing up for another call to Amazon, in an attempt to speak to a supervisor of some sort. I pray this will bring some sort of positive conclusion to this incident. Those pictures are unbelievably important to myself and my roll as a designated photographer for the festival.",0

"I use amazon ALOT and after a friend told me about ‘vine customers’ I made sure to write helpful reviews in the hope I’d be selected as one! Amazon removed my reviews and said I wasn’t allowed to review anymore as they thought I had posted a bias review for a friend or family member! The operator agreed that they couldn’t understand why as the item I had reviewed was Christmas cards, n I had bought about 30 of them all the same kind, but from different sellers on amazon and I left pretty much the same review for all of them! The one seller had no relation and the seller was miles & miles away! Amazon refused to tell me why they thought it was a dodgy review and wouldn't look into it further! So now I can’t become s vine customer and I wasted hours n hours writing helpful reviews! Oh and amazon allows pictures from reviews to be used on other websites as my face is plastered on an online article and the picture that was only posted on an amazon review!",0

"*DO NOT TRUST AMAZON*Everyone who has EVER purchased anything on Amazon check all of your bank statements very closely. Look for Prime that you have never subscribed to also for Amazon Music. When you place an order with a third party seller, they (Amazon) have a habit of ""accidentally"" signing you up to one of these subscription services and charging to ANY CARD that has been used to buy a product. Even if it is not in the name of the person who holds the Amazon account.Example! My 70 year old mother was being billed for Amazon music, she did not even know about this. It went on for months. Finally yesterday I got to the cause of it and Amazon has agreed to refund ALL 8 wrongfully claimed payments from a pensioner. That amounted to almost £80 STOLEN from a vulnerable person.They also agreed to refund the £9.99 STOLEN from my card. It only came to my attention when I used my mothers Amazon to order an item from a third party seller. When I checked my card. I had been charged £9.99 for Amazon music, as my mother's registered card was lost and had to be cancelled and replaced. So Amazon took the money without authorisation from my account. Just to add. I have now been charged £1 by amazon only a day after this scamming, thieving, fraudulent bunch of vultures ""apologised"" for stealing money. I therefore deleted both my card and my mother's card from amazon. I suggest EVERYONE does the same. If you buy anything on Amazon, DO NOT STORE YOUR CARD!!! Simply input it for each transaction. Your money is NOT SAFE!! Better than that NEVER USE AMAZON. We never will again!!Had this not happened, and I had not been charged my mother would never have known about this and Amazon would have continued pocketing her money. Along with their tax avoidance schemes. So be warned. This company openly admitted to me that the system sometimes ""accidentally"" subscribes when a purchase is made. The person who scripted Amazon's website must be a total amateur if this is what happens. So everyone get checking you statements, if you see one payment to AMAZON MUSIC or AMAZON PRIME, that you have not asked for, go to your bank (or call them) Order statements dating back to when you first started using Amazon. You may find more unauthorised charges. Also if you have elderly parents who use amazon help them check their account. Amazon do not pay tax correctly, why should they also get away with STEALING from vulnerable people.My mother's was almost £80, your refund could be more, It depends how long it has been ongoing. But every penny they have taken without permission will be refunded. And Amazon if you're reading this. ALL CARDS have now been removed from your scummy site and not one more order will be placed using Amazon. Sorry this is a long post but it needed explaining in case amazon are stealing from others. They certainly won't check their end, as long as they get their money coming in. So ensure you all check.I would love to have replies on here of anyone who checks their account and finds they have been unknowingly charged. I know for a fact amazon do it frequently, my bank told me this and even said they refund people OFTEN. So there is a good chance of you being owed and I would love to hear about your situation.Thanks for reading.",0
"Amazon start sending items in the right size boxes, Penny pinching & making gifts look like they have been kept in the garage for 10 years, waited for a delivery for 8 days & I agreed to return, waited another week for replacement & it’s exactly the same, shopping online conveniences should have to include printing return labels & wasted petrol because you are penny pinching on boxes & postage 🤬",0

Love Amazon and have paid for an Amazon Prime account for years as it is well worth it with as often as my household uses it.,2
"As a longtime customer of Amazon.com, I have mixed feelings about my recent interactions with the company. While I can't deny the consistently decent quality of their goodss and supports, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall interaction.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of goodss available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home decents, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the goodss I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming interaction less appealing. It feels like I'm being nickel-and-dimed for every additional support, making it harder to justify the extra expenses.",1
Worst customer service experience I've ever had. They charged me double for an Audible subscription but cannot see those charges in my account . They referred me 10 times back and fourth between different internal customer service numbers without success. Spent 3 hours of my life calling because of a failure of the company to establish efficient and customer friendly internal systems and lines of communication. It is noticeable that you're dealing with a gigantic company only in existance because they minimize costs and exploit their employees as well as their customers.,0
Love the offers on prime day sale. Fast shipping and customer reviews for products help get the right product. Specially the video reviews on the website are very helpful.,2
You'd think with how simple it is to buy on Amazon they'd implement a similar system for sellers. Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!,1

Really requires patience to wait for the item to arrive at your doorstep!,1
The customer support was acceptable.  The background noise at the call center was horrible.  I couldn't hear myself think when I had to answer the questions.  I felt like someone was shouting over me.  I've designed call centers for years.  I can tell when employees are sitting on top of each other without any sound attenuation.  It made my customer support usage really unpleasant.  They need to do better.  They are Amazon and they are taking over the world.  They have money for better call centers.,1
I failed to receive 1/4 packages I ordered. They are AWFUL about actually getting things to you.,0

"Recently (last couple of months) Amazon Prime order has never been on time - it is delayed at least by couple of days.Also - they show more items that are not delivered, as delivered to resident! when you finally figure how to contact amazon - they just say we will refund or replace... they do not seem to understand the inconvenience of not getting the item when needed.Amazon logistics is slipping and might be the gap needed for Walmart kind of players to take more of the online shopping over",1

"Worst customer service I have ever encountered. My payment wasn’t going through due to an issue on their side. Was talked in circles by the customer service representative eventually the problem was solved not before I almost threw my phone out of sheer frustration dealing with the rep. Once the problem was solved I was then contacted again two minutes later asking what my problem was and how could they help. Upon informing them that my problem had already been fixed the new rep continued to ask my account details and what I needed fixed. No one listens, they are condescending and waste your time.",0
"I used to rely on Amazon so much to deliver so fast to me, not I have to order more days ahead, they need to fix their order supports.",1
Customer service SUCKS!  I have had 3 items break in the last 6 months.  Amazon makes you jump through hoops to return an item.  They DO NOT make clear who I am buying a product from as some item are a 3rd party seller.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR 3rd PARTY SELLERS as amazon does nothing to resolve issues with defective items.  They make it virtually impossible and jump through so many hoops hoping you will just give up.  They sell inferior Chinese built items that break down LONG before they should.,0

"I like amazon, but their prices for prime are getting absurd and I don’t like that you can’t post realistic reviews anymore because they are afraid of losing revenue. They censor your reviews to the point you can’t even review products accurately anymore. I’m almost to the point of writing them off and using eBay exclusively.It’s also very telling to a consumer when the business focuses and spends more time and money censoring reviews than providing quality customer service.",0
"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer support at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1

Amazon make it VERY difficult to get free order when you spend over £20. It used to be automatically applied. Now you have to get past the constant flogging of Amazon prime go through the order option and select free order. Not only must you spend a whopping 20 quid you have to avoid getting mugged at the check out for free order. How many BILLIONS do this lot need.,1

"DIFFERENT AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SETS OF INSTRUCTION!!!Normally, Amazon is alright for me. I don’t have to pay for shipping when I want to return any products I buy from there. Also, returning is normally quite easy and only takes at the very least 15-20 mins. I end up getting a full refund a few days after sending the products.However, when I recently tried to return a defective product, I was told that I HAD to pay for SHIPPING to return. Fortunately, they said I would get a refund for that as well. I went to the nearest local mail service point. They told me they could not accept it as it contained batteries.I contacted Amazon and a representative told me that I had to return it by UPS and that I couldn’t do so by any other way, even though I had used only the local mail service and DHL to return Amazon products in the past. Like I had mentioned earlier, I had to pay for shipping. I had no idea how much shipping would be but I didn’t really care. The closest UPS store is pretty far from where I live unlike the local mail courier and DHL so imagine my disappointment when I’m told that I needed a tracking number. I already had the other papers like the shipping labels which I had always used to return Amazon products and nothing else. In addition, that Amazon representative told me that all that I had was all I needed..I contact Amazon again and it takes 20-30 mins this time to get a response. Again, another Amazon representative told me that I COULD return by DHL. So I went to a DHL store.The guy at the DHL store told me I needed a label if I wanted to ship for free(I always received that whenever I wanted to return an Amazon product and I could return for free) but that was the one thing I did not get from Amazon for the first time. An Amazon sales rep did say that I would have to pay for shipping but I wasn’t told how much it would be. The DHL guy told me it would cost TWICE as much as the cost I had paid for the product. That would mean that I would have to pay for absolutely nothing but stress and travelling and some transport costs..I contacted Amazon for the last time. A different sales rep told me that she felt sorry for all the trouble I had gone through just for this and told me that I no longer had to return the product and I would still get a refund.Will see if I actually get a refund like last time or not..If I do, I’ll change this to 2 stars instead.",0
STOLEN returns parcel  to be picked up by Royal Mail by Amazon courier . Impossible to get hold of customer care just a BOT,0

"Closed froze an account my friend had made in my name by mistake (we had a misunderstanding) when she trying to figure out where her items were (she didn’t even ask for a refund -just wanted her stuff!). They said it violated their terms of service.They never arrived and I ended up getting charged for them. I made my own account (thinking that one was deleted) and they closed it a few days after I ordered mask filters and was charged for Prime. I’m DONE with Amazon and anything to do with it, including Whole Foods. I was trying to do the right thing and to be a good customer (not using the account my friend had thought I wanted/she created in my name) but I guess they didn’t see that. This and for ethical reasons, I want nothing to do with them. I’ve heard that has happened to other people, too.",0
I ordered a book and the item arrived in 48 hours. I am very happy about the service from Amazon UK.,2
"I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated order time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.",1

My dad has Amazon Prime, and I have Amazon student, and both of them offer free 2 day shipping on prime eligible items, and textbooks are very cheap with 2 day shipping. Just make sure your purchase is from amazon and not a seller on amazon, and you'll have quick delivery without any mishaps or issues. I recommend this site to everyone I know.",2
So I changed my phone number and also got a new phone and couldn’t get into my Amazon. I had things in my cart but nothing I needed went thru all the security questions with no problem and was still told Thst my account is locked because the agent tried to many times and it locked so I needed to call back in 4 hours and go thru being on hold and answering all the questions again. Due to that I cancelled my prime account and that’s that. The customer service was terrible from the two agents I got before the supervisor who was actually nice.,0
"Amazon prime, is fantastic. Love shopping with them. Easier than having to go everywhere looking for the stuff you want. They are fast and reliable and efficient. And the delivery drivers are brilliant 😊😊",2

"Decent online shop, friendly customer support and fast shipping, I only have two minors complaint about Amazon and hope they can improve on it. Firstly, would be the pricing of items. Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement. SERIOUSLY!? For the past 10 orders, I do not have any problems with my billing address. In the end have to create a brand new account.",1

Then reached out again over a week later and was told they had refunded the gifter and there was nothing they could do about it to make it right for me/doing anything for me. Thanks for not solving a simple customer problem over some diapers Amazon....really means a lot after being a dedicated Prime member for decades.",0
Brilliant overseas mailing service for presents,2
Love Amazon.  Ok you may find it cheaper elsewhere but the service you get is second to none,2
"I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My usages with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!",1
My Kindle ebook reader developed a fault which I reported to Amazon at 5.30 in the afternoon.  A replacement was delivered by 8.30 the next morning!,2
I do not understand the negitive reviewsNext day delivery on basically everything. Everytime I've had a problem with an item it's been easy to return with no issues,2
"I have been a Prime customer for yers and have always had a pretty decent usage up until the last few months. More times than not when I select a goods it will give an estimate of 1-2 days on shipping, but once I pay for the item and it gets shipped, the shipping time changes from 5-8 days. Shipping has become unreliable, and the shipment people do not follow deliver instructions at all. I even have video recordings from my doorbell cam of them making rude comments when dropping my packages. It is almost pointless to pay for Prime for the purposes of faster shipping.",1
"Decent company has a wide variety of items as you would expect from Amazon. The customer support is slowly becoming better and better. I like shopping with Amazon as it is quick and reliable and I can always get a refund if needed. However I think there are some areas that could be improved, for example, the way they treat their staff and handle acceptables",1
"I absolutely love Amazon because they’ve made life so much easier, as well as countless others.  There have been a couple of unpleasant experiences but it’s to be expected when most of all my gazillion purchases are Amazon.  In rural areas, Amazon does there best to get packages to customers but expecting 2 day deliveries is unrealistic, 4 days has been the maximum time I’ve waited.  To lift the burden off Amazon, if I didn’t need the item, I’d click on standard shipping but the packages came quicker than if I didn’t have prime.  My hope is that Mr. Bezos opens an Amazon distribution center in Niagara Falls and a kiosk retail store would bring lots of people from the entire WNY area and Canada.  Niagara Falls is ripe for a business like Amazon because there’s a lot of open space and from an economical standpoint, a steal.  My daughter in NYC said Amazon Fresh is “lovely”, a word she has never used to describe a retail food delivery service.  Thank you for reading my review.",2
Great selection of goodss and professional order. However the website is over complicated and it is confusing and miss leading when it comes to cancelling prime. They know they have us wrapped around their finger and they abuse this power in my opinion.,1
Excellent thanks for letting,1
"I have ordered two items in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.

A seller was dishonest and a shipment they claimed was shipped and billed to me never actually shipped when really looking at tracking, package never arrived, seller did not care and would not refund, and Amazon did nothing- just allows the seller to operate this way taking advantage of customers with false advertising of products and dishonest business practices.",0

"My pkg was delivered as specified. However, the driver stated it was handed directly to me. The driver never rang my doorbell. I just happened to see the package on my front porch several hours after being delivered.",1
Good Experience making payment etc!!,2
"I have been having the worst usage on Amazon. First, I paid for a 75 dollar controller that was supposed to be brand new. The controller turned out to be used and the code that came in the box was already redeemed. Now I just subscribed to prime thinking they will charge me at the end of the month. That was a farce because they just took 15 dollars out of my account within 5 minutes. Customer assistance told me it will be 3-5 business days until I get a refund.",1
Will contunue to use in the future always a good service provided.,2

"I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer support numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer support saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a decent way to treat their loyal customers.",1
"Appalling situation between Amazon and third party reseller Right Deals. Took my money instantly on a bed with delivery 3 days later, item didn't arrive. Next delivery date was given to me so I took 2 days off as stated between 2 days, item didn't arrive. Asked to cancel to be told I couldn't. Now still no bed, no refund 3 weeks later. Spoke to a rude customer service representative called Dirk who told me I was being a nuisance.. Basically feeling scammed with no support.. where do I go from here??",0
The prime system is great but what Amazon doesn't say is the fact that if you want Amazon Fresh and Prime you have to pay twice 15$. Not once as it looks like. Which results in $30 per month..,2
"First of all you can find anything under the sun on Amazon.  I can usually find the best prices and delivery is as promised.  They're usually my ""go to"" place when I'm looking for merchandise.",2
For a long time Amazon was number one with me. I have been a prime member for years. Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer assistance has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,1
Amazon has always provided great products and at cheapest prices The delivery drivers are the issue not the company itself,2
"Had a prime account associated with an email I no longer had control of. The associate indicated they would cancel the prime membership and refund a period of the charging as I was not using the benefits. That was more than I could have asked for. What I was after was an email for officially closing the account down. I never received that email. Or the refund. Nor was the prime membership cancelled.A lot of the actions they said they were taking were right there as we were speaking. I'm confused that I spent all that time and we achieved nothing. Ultimately I was able to get control of the email linked to the prime account. Customer service definitely did not play any role in this resolution. Amazon's a good experience when you're buying stuff, but if they start charging your card and you don't know where it's coming from, they sure as hell don't. At least, that's the answer I got from the associate I talked with before the one I discussed above.Stats:-Total Time Spent on Phone: 45 minutes-Satisfaction with Resolution: No resolution",0
"Amazon is not providing the support I am paying for as a prime member. When searching for a phone case, I was looking for a shipment date that would work before leaving for vacation. NOW it's going to arrive after I have left!!!! I used to get shipment the next day for free. This particular order was not for next day but in 2 days. That's when it showed it would be delivered. Now I look and it's going to be delivered in 3 days!!!!! THAT is NOT customer support. We are in the Service Industry not the slow as possible industry. Where is the commitment to support?!?  Now I have no phone case for my phone and I will likely drop it and break it before I ever receive my phone case if it doesn't blow away before I return. NOT happy! And before you say you can cancel, no, I tried but no they can't accommodate THAT either!!",1
"Every time there is a TBA shipment tracking number, I think they should change it to TBS, for To Be Screwed-up. USPS, only rarely do I have issues, but the TBA system sucks. What was supposed to be next day shipment, is now 2-3 day shipment.",1
Amazon are excellent on prices and goods. Quick delivery and I was kept up to date with details of delivery by e-mail.,2
"Irritating, cant get through to Customer Service without millions of questions. Then call back does not workNot what they used to beCancelling my PRIME after 10 years.Turning FANS to frustration",0
"Overall 5 Stars for Amazon…I love the convenience! But this packaging, I give three stars bc I question the waste from the shipping dept. And it’s happened before. Why do they package 2 very small items in a huge box with 4 ft of air pockets?  What a waste!",1
"Absolutely disgusted with Amazon, yesterday I placed an order through Amazon which I have done many times before, today I see a notice on Amazon (no email sent to me) that the card I used didn't go through and so they have charged to another card on my account (which is my work credit card) with no authorisation from me, this card was not linked as a default card.  This has now caused an issue with my employer as I only have this card for work related purchases. I am also quite sure that unless I agree that a card can be used as a default card then automatic payments cannot be made.",0
"Seems like they don't have much quality check of who they cooperate with. Sometimes my package didn't arrive and no one answered my emails, sometimes the package was so poorly packed that it was ruined and sometimes the quality was so bad I could not wear it.",0
Very good delivery. Prime is useful. Great,2
Excellent thanks,1
ordered and didnt arrive but customer support refudned me instantly.,1
I have had to return 2 items over the last couple of months and it is an easy process.  Thanks for taking the headache out of returns,2
I ordered a sandisk 1tb microsd from Amazon and it was perfectly working. The only thing I hate about Amazon is their support which isn't very humanly.,1
"Amazon driver called me and said if you want the delivery you have to come to drivers location, I said I will cancel the order, then driver said you are almost welcome. I canceled my Amazon account not worth.",0
Need to look into your seller's duty... They are packing very poorly..... Bad usage,1
Love the benefits but the prices are expensive relatively The reviews are hard to figure if they are real or promoted or spam love the free shipping if the price is comparable,1
"I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.",1
"Amazon is so good about customer service and delivery.  (I love my Kindle Fire too.)This book is pretty amazing.  Another great resource for my husband and me to help with the good old IRS.  Over 40 years, we have only been audited twice.  The first time we were young and foolish in our business.  Now, we listened to the wrong people about our newly emptied nest and some investments we were told were deductions.  We knew it was too good to be true.  Hope this book helps.",2
Putting shirts out that encourage murder of anykind is wrong Amazon. Those shirts saying Black Lives Matter and Blue lives Murder are encouraging crime.  Shame on you Amazon.  This is a disgrace!,0
My son ordered a gaming monitor £169 and instead received a watch £30. He had signed for it because you need a code now for anything over £100. We returned the watch and have now had a gaming monitor delivered 5times! They won’t leave it because we have no code which was supposed to be sent but never received for the replacement. Customer service appalling! Now waiting for a refund 🤞🏻all because someone can’t be bothered to send a simple replacement code.,0
"I order a lot of books for my business. I love to shop on Amazon because I can find the books I need and search by price, so that I can find the book at rock bottom prices. I also find it extremely helpful that Amazon includes pretty extensive details about the book, such as the number of pages, a description, all of the sellers that offer the book (new and used), and even supplies reviews from users like me, all on one page.",2
"I ordered a Ninja air fryer on the 14/12. Today I was told Hermes had delivered it at 3.44 pm today. First they said it had been handed to the customer and then changed it to ‘left in a safe place’. Neither of which was true. Amazon have said they will send a full refund. Fine, but this was a surprise Christmas gift for my daughter. Shame on you Hermes and Amazon. Very disappointed.",0
Great service - any problems they accept no worries,2
My book is not showing on Amazon.Com but is on Amazon.UK.  I have repeatedly messaged Amazon about this but none of their advisors read my emails correctly. I have tried to raise a formal complaint by asking for details of their procedure / contact but these requests have also been ignored.  I have been disgusted by Amazon’s failure to address these issues.,0
"After almost 20 years of custom I finally kicked Amazon UK into touch. I have spent thousands of pounds with them but over time have gotten more more fed up with missed promised deliveries, outrageous delays in returns and refunds, bad customer service and their determination to ignore UK consumer law.I am now spending my hard earned cash elsewhere and actually enjoying it and I would recommend that you do to.",0
I ordered a knife on Amazon but it cames late and I don't need it anymore. Amazon refunded me without asking me to return it. Can't complain.,2
"Again, one more time and maybe the million, Amazon confused the delivery status and mark the order as delivered while it's not!! This time is delivery to Amazon lockers under Amazon prime. The tracking page shows it's delivered while the order page shows undelivered. Moreover I didn't receive the locker code. Confusion and frustration. not the first time, not the second  not even the tenth!! To put facts together, the order number is 113-8438196-4651453Do you want more order numbers? Personally the delivery failure and confusion is up 20% with me.",0
"Half the packages delivered smell strongly of heavy laundry products chemically infused. Their employees transfer the smell from their clothes onto the products. Asthma, rash. This has happened too many times. Ordering elsewhere.",0

I have being shopping at Amazon from about 2005 and never had a problem with my package.Once I ordered and my item was the wrong size sent and contact them and it was rectified easily.IOn another occassion I bought an item and I did not get it and they re sent another.No hassle.I will continue shopping Amazon.PLEASE READERS DO NOT SHOP CHARLOTTE RUSSE..THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!,2
"I don't understand why people have issues with amazon Im happy with them, shipping is fast and price got better these last years, now it's similar to ebay it used to be more expensive",2
They’ve gotten difficult over the years.  I recently had items in my cart and called prior to ordering and the second rep (Amazon Locker Specialist) explained the items weren’t eligible for Amazon Locker and why but to go ahead with shipment to a UPS Store and they’d make an exception and reimburse the per package fee.  I received the three packages today and called for the $15.  The first agent insisted after I explained it all again there was “no record” like I’d made it up.  I think their game is for the consumer to give up. He transferred me to a supervisor who also made me explain it before mentioning they “have a recording of the conversation” and she credited $15.,1
amazon are not as ordinary but things you get off them are cheap at times and not the right colour and at great standards and i wont not use this website alot as i ordered screen protectors off it and they were terrible and order charging case and look every cheap and did not charge,1
But I don't use it,1
"I have had multiple orders now with issues, most not delivering on time or not delivering at all, customer service is always an issue.  Went on line yesterday for a prime service item, (I am a prime member), on an item that the commitment was delivered in 30 days or more, how is that Prime service when the item is out of stock?   They get worse each day......",0
I would leave zero stars but you know the drill. I’ve had two packages over the past 10 days marked “delivered hand delivered to customer.” Both packages were neither hand delivered or delivered at all. Forget trying to call customer service. There is no way to speak to an actual person. It’s all automated. To make things worse the option to request a refund is no longer available for the missing items.,0
"Items not delivered or items missing, customer service agents can barely speak English very stressful and not straightforward to raise a claim. In my opinion very poorly ran company potential to be better than ebay but doubt it ever will be as the foundations for success are failed. At least with ebay they speak English quickly and easy to resolve any issue.",0
great policy and return protection,2
"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank acceptableness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your support we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
"I've had Amazon Prime for 2 years, and I love the instant gratification aspect of it. $3.99 shipping for Next Day! Love it.",2
"WHY YOU DON'T FIRED THIS GUYS WORKING FOR AMAZON !!!!????   I enjoyed buying things from Amazon, but now , no more. I'm even afraid to make more orders , because they still the packages after they take de picture and lately they delivered my orders to the other neighbors door. After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1
"Good products and low price! A world without Amazon would be possible, but I do not want to live in it :D",2
"I'm really happy of the service I got from Amazon. Good package, good product, fast delivery.The best ecommerce website.",2
"WARNING - Do not use Amazon as a platform to keep your book reviews. I was stupid enough to do so for several years. A process I enjoyed and one that caused no issues. In April 2023, I submitted a review which was rejected because they said 'it breached the guidelines' Examining the guidelines it was not obvious how, but I re-wrote it, resubmitted it and heard no more. The same happened in November 2024 and then in December and completely out-of-the-blue I got an email saying 'I'd breached guidelines and my review rights had been withdrawn'. What they did not say was all my review were removed. Gone - years of input, a real treasure trove of memories of my reading hobby. From that time I tried hard to communicate with Amazon to ask that they be restored, but they were rude, hostile, they continually obfuscated, were totally unclear, seemed unable to grasp basic concepts and their responses were frequently unintelligible and on several occasions they lied. They denied repetitively they have a complaints department and they showed a general lack of any personal care or concern. This is a company that strives (so says its mission) to be the earth's most customer centric company. This is an insult to it's customers - they might delivery parcels ok, but when things go wrong they it is clear that they have the  'Earth's most incompetent customer service department' ",0
Told my son to order a pack of water bottles on prime which I paid for. The bottles were for my youngest son who was too ill to go out and buy for himself. He never got them. Amazon claims they have proof of delivery but have not sent it to us. The seller is blaming Amazon to whom they entrust delivery. Amazon doesn’t care - I’m ten pounds down and my dehydrated son never got his water. The seller only cares about getting a bad review. We order a lot from Amazon and have never complained even when our goods were delivered to nearby streets etc. this time I am appalled by their refusal to furnish proof they claim they have or offer a refund. I spent money and got no goods.Not acceptable.,0
"I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My usages with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!",1
Amazon is either really great. OR really terrible,1
"amazon is where i find all of my online products, i love it.",2
"We adore Amazon!  Customer service is OUTSTANDING! I have trained in customer service throughout my career and Amazon has it in spades!!  Even though I may find a product a little cheaper elsewhere, I will always go with Amazon because they have the #1 customer service of ANY company I have ever dealt with!  Their Prime is fantastic!!  Their shipping is at light speed! You can track all of your orders. Their returns are fabulous! They are 100% reliable!  What more could you ask for?",2
Delivered on time but usually just dump it on doorstep,1
"Their delivery is terrible. You pay for Prime. You pay extra money for same day delivery. Wait up till 10:00 pm because they say it will deliver by then and then nothing. You track the package and it was 15 minutes away for 8 hours! You call customer service and they don’t care. Just another company that is about profits, not people. This happens all to often now. Amazon used to be good. Now it’s like a high end Wish.",0
Amazon  customer care number 8247721430 item related quairy . I have only used amazon prime vendors and have had absolutely no issues. Amazon has always shipped on time and had an easy no hassles return policy if a item was defective. I can’t say the same for other vendors such as Best Buy or Walmart.,1
Must admit most of the items I purchase from Amazon are books; craft books mostly.  I have never found a book I wanted cheaper elsewhere.  I always go for the free delivery option.  Amazon has never let me down...,2
I have always found Amazon to be reliable and their refund/ returns policy is very fair. They were a lifesaver during lockdown when the shops were shut. I find their free delivery on certain items to be a good reason to shop with them. Their security system is also good and I feel confident leaving my card details with them.,2
"Ordered a package that said it was fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for prime shipping.... then it gave me some stupid 2 week away window..... They shipped through this absolute joke of a company called landmark global (if you search for them you find nothing but poor reviews on this scumbag cancerous operation).... they shipped within 2 days to New York (I am in Alberta Canada) then it sat there for 2 weeks! suffice to say they blew right through their ""window"" I called Amazon to see what the hell was going on as I needed the goods ordered.... both agents were less than useful and hard to understand, they told me to wait another week!, finally after 4 days it updated that it has shipped to ontario and god knows how much longer it will be.... I order a lot of stuff through amazon so this disaster of an experience is making me second guess that decision, not impressed at all. what a joke.",0

"If you plan to buy anything from AMAZON... make sure that it is NOT coming from a 3rd party seller thru AMAZON! You could end up in a loop to loop bounce around of who is at fault IF your purchase does not show up.

"Amazon cancelled all my recent orders due to a ""security concern"" that they thought someone else had accessed my account - they did not, and these were orders I personally placed on Amazon, but their security system is too stupid to know the difference. Now I am struggling going back and forth between the BBB and the Amazon Executive Account Team.Get rid of your damn ""security"" system if it is stopping people from doing legitimate business on your website!Edit for Update: Amazon restored my order that was canceled. Rating increased because my order was restored to my account, but customer support was very unhelpful. 3 stars at most only because of the headache it caused me trying to get it fixed.",1

"I have used Amazon for years.  I am a Prime member but believe I get more than my membership fees in return.  I use multiple areas available and have never been disappointed.  I regularly place orders which are almost always delivered on time and in great shape.  I get notifications of orders, shipping and delivery information as well. Any order I have had issues with has been quickly and easily resolved. The Subscribe and Save is fantastic.  Monthly deliveries of items I use at a minimum of 5% discount.The Prime Video is great and I use it often.  You can add other offerings like BritBox and more.  Their Prime Originals are usually great and I end up binge watching them.  If ordering, you can pre-order DVDs and books.

Amazon needs to stop jacking up prices because a 8 dollar thing becomes popular and over night it almost 20 dollars. And forcing customers to purchase a certain amount before taking them to the check out screen. Not cool. You are getting greedy,1

"Awful ""customer service"" program. Everything is this self-service garbage. When you need more detail or an explanation that you cannot get with self-service answers, you are left in the dark. To actually speak to a real person, it is so hidden to get to it's beyond frustrating. Finally getting to an area that had a chance to message with a representative, there was ""technical difficulties"" and could not communicate. No simple email or anything. They should not even have a so-called ""customer service"" section, since it isn't. Terrible.",0

"Pathetic customer service, very unreliable, unprofessional, app and website does not seem to be working for little things like updating the address and mobile number. I tried to log in via webpage while my app was connected- entered email address, then password then it was asking to send the code to mobile which was old and could not update via app and also somehow it was asking the credit card csv as security. I tried couple of times and then via app started using the option of chatting. One indian women picked up my chat, after understanding my message, said I am gonna transfer the request for better help, nobody got connected, i had to end the chat and start the new chat again again there was another indian guy who asked me questions and took my number plus asked where i am from and made me connected to someone who only looks after Canada and US. So they have been wating my time making me going in circles. How long does it take to simply update the number if it is not getting done via app for may be some technical reasons. Pathetic.  It's too big company that they dont even care how customers are getting treated.",0

At the very least it should have had a new blade put on it.  I will still use Amazon when purchasing some items. But beware when buying tools as they may be used but sold as new.",0
"Christmas is currently ruined because of Amazon.  I had expected 3 packages today from Amazon.  When they hadn't arrived by 8pm I checked online, only to discover that they had been delivered and signed for by a completely different person in an entirely different location.  I then spent 2 hours trying to find out where my packages had been sent to.  Amazon couldn't contact the driver to re-deliver which is ridiculous!!!  I am so upset by the whole incident that I will no longer be using Amazon.",0
I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.,2
I often ordered from Amazon and the shipment always arrives to my doorstep in shortest possible time. It is always well packed and I can follow the route of the ordered goods.,2
If you order a lot it would behoove you to have Prime. Well worth it! I get most of my items in 2-3 days! Been ordering for quite a while and S&H is free with Prime. I love this service!!!,2
I have never seen a delivery person because they just dump the parcel on the doorstep and clear off.,0
"I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My interactions with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!",1
"We sent something back via hermes, over 17 days ago and it says attempt for collection was made. They collected it, amazon say its not returned. But they wont sort this. Now its escalated joke .",0
"Once upon a time, in the magical land of Amazon.com, I embarked on a quest to buy a variety of items and even sell some of my own. Little did I know that this journey would be filled with both laughter and bewilderment.As a buyer, my interaction has been mostly positive. Amazon's vast selection of items and speedy shipment make it a convenient choice for all your shopping needs. However, there have been times when I've encountered the occasional weirdness with returns. It's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and hopping on one foot.But fear not, dear reader, for I have discovered a hidden treasure! On rare occasions, I've managed to summon a human customer assistance representative. These elusive creatures are surprisingly pleasant and possess the power to make your problems disappear with a wave of their magical wand.Now, let's talk about the dark side of Amazon: the seller interaction. As a small business owner, I must warn you that Amazon is a greedy and ridiculous platform. It's like a dragon hoarding all the gold and leaving you with just a few measly coins. Their policies are designed to maximize their own profits, leaving sellers feeling like they're on a never-ending quest for fairness.To all aspiring merchants out there, I would advise you to tread carefully in the treacherous realm of Amazon. Offer your items on their platform to reach a wider audience, but don't put all your eggs in this basket. Instead, create your own enchanted website and offer your wares at a slightly lower price. It's like offering a secret discount to those who dare to venture beyond the Amazon kingdom.In conclusion, dear reader, Amazon.com is a land of contrasts. As a consumer, you'll likely have a fine interaction, but as a seller, be prepared for a wild and unpredictable journey. So, gather your courage, sharpen your wit, and may the odds be ever in your favor!",1
You'd think with how simple it is to buy on Amazon they'd implement a similar system for sellers. Instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying. For example the BIZARRE system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even OFFER *free* postage?!,1
Love the benefits but the prices are expensive relatively The reviews are hard to figure if they are real or promoted or spam love the free shipping if the price is comparable,1
"This morning I found a group packages left on the corner of my yard right next to a public sidewalk. Five Amazon Prime packages, for addresses other than mine, had been dumped on my property by, I presume, the Amazon Prime delivery person. I called Amazon Customer Service and spoke to a representative who was argumentative and unhelpful. I explained that these were all Prime packages for people who were paying Amazon a subscription fee in order to ensure quick, safe, responsible delivery. I told her that I live a 15-minute drive away from the Robbinsville, NJ Amazon Warehouse Fulfillment Center at 50 Canton Way and did not understand why this problem could not be resolved today. The Customer Service rep said she would file a report, but did not ask for any of the tracking numbers for the packages. She then told me just to leave the packages outside and someone would be by-- sometime--to pick them up. I waited all day for that to happen.Late this afternoon I called Amazon Customer Service again. This representative was more pleasant and helpful. Apparently, the first Customer Service rep with whom I had spoken did not even file a report when this rep looked to find it. This second rep took tracking numbers with which to file a report and said it would take three days for a pickup to happen for redelivery, which is Amazon's policy, even for Prime subscribers! Again, I said that was unacceptable. For example, Amazon now delivers prescription medications and what if someone is waiting for a prescription to be delivered. I told the rep a three-day redelivery for Prime does not make sense, is bad business, and that I would deliver four of the five packages to the houses whose locations in my neighborhood I know. As for the fifth package, Amazon will actually have to have someone do their job and come to pick it up for redelivery. I also expressed that I do not work for Amazon. With that being said however, the four packages I said I would deliver are now at their correct addresses.Amazon Prime buyer/subscriber beware. I would have left a rating of ""zero"" if that had been an option. Perhaps Amazon's founder and former CEO, instead of now spending billions of dollars looking for a new planet on which to live (funded in part by Amazon Prime subscribers), should have ensured that Amazon's workforce is valued, not recklessly overworked, that the employees are responsible, and Amazon has logical, work-flow procedures in place in order to deal with problems that are not so difficult to solve.",0
I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
"Amazon... One of the biggest companies out there... You all seriously don't have an option to upload credit card information manually every time you purchase? I'm forced to upload my card and have it saved there until removed? What if my kids get into my account and decides to buy everything as far as the eye can see? I wouldn't be able to stop it considering my card information is saved and all they have to do is click ""continue""... I just purchased a laptop and apparently I still had my old card uploaded there from a purchase I did years ago WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. Thank God It was a Credit card and according to Tamara I was able to change the payment method to my new card before Amazon charged my old card. Or else there would of been a big problem. Won't be purchasing anything off of Amazon again until you all change the option to purchase something without having to upload and save your card information. How unsecure...",0
Great assortments and great customer service.I had a problem with a delivery and they solved this very well.,2

Amazon very very acceptable assistance number 6291783354//7462924659,1
Has been consistently efficient and I have been using them for years. Amazon almost always has the lowest prices too!,2
"I have shopped Amazon for years and have never been disappointed.  Most times, I can buy what I want with just one click and I have the product the next day.",2
Always had good experience with amazon. well done,2
"A great e-commerce portal to buy whatever you want, including stuff that you cannot find in local shops. Easy purchases, including cash on delivery, and every other means of electronic payment. Tracking is fluid and delivery is always on time. The deliveryman also bring machines to help you pay with cards. Completely satisfied with the purchase.",2
"The worse company to make shopping online, if you want avoid at bad situation not but in Amazon. They never have a time slot to deliver your order, the costumer service the only solution they give you is to wait, if you have to return an item it is a big problem to get your money back, in my case they told me that the order arrived in one day and it's been a week and they haven't delivered it to me I spoke with costumer service and they told me that I have to wait two more weeks and I can't cancel the order I have to wait three weeks to request a refund",0
I have never seen a delivery person because they just dump the parcel on the doorstep and clear off.,0
Average - shipment speed was fine but item pretty ordinary quality,1
"Please be aware that Amazon trade in service is a scam! Amazon condone their scam and won't help. I sent a complete Xbox, all accessories and in perfect condition and working order. They halved the amount promised saying that I didn't send all accessories (why would I keep them???) And that the console was damaged. They could not send me pictures of said damage nor tell me what was missing. I'm furious.",0
Tried to exchange a beautiful bag my sister sent for my birthday for a different color. Huge disappointment and waste of time for a simple request.  Never got the exchange and wasted a half hour on their help chat line,0
"Had a prime account associated with an email I no longer had control of. The associate indicated they would cancel the prime membership and refund a period of the charging as I was not using the benefits. That was more than I could have asked for. What I was after was an email for officially closing the account down. I never received that email. Or the refund. Nor was the prime membership cancelled.A lot of the actions they said they were taking were right there as we were speaking. I'm confused that I spent all that time and we achieved nothing. Ultimately I was able to get control of the email linked to the prime account. Customer service definitely did not play any role in this resolution. Amazon's a good experience when you're buying stuff, but if they start charging your card and you don't know where it's coming from, they sure as hell don't. At least, that's the answer I got from the associate I talked with before the one I discussed above.Stats:-Total Time Spent on Phone: 45 minutes-Satisfaction with Resolution: No resolution",0
Canceled my prime membership was not 2 day shipping when called was told did you get the product I said yes it was a birthday present in 4 days I had to go to a store last min. to buy something else. Not the first time. they dont honor 2day or refund. Shop walmart,0
"I've been using my Son's Prime account for 5+ years & now need to use my own account.I'm at my wits end after several calls to Customer Service which seems to be someone in a foreign country each time.After I enter my email address in the box, Amazon sends me a numeric code that I successfully enter in a box.  The problem begins here; Amazon asks me for the expiration date of an old credit card that I haven't used in years because it was compromised & closed.No matter how many times I enter my email  & enter their security code, authenticate my address...the program always asks the same question...""what is the expiration date of an expired credit card""!I want my account restored using my email.  The suggestions from support were ""get a new email or use my phone number instead"".  I run my life using a central email & don't want non urgent texts coming to my phone & I certainly don't want Amazon telling me to change my phone number should another issue arise were I to use my phone number.I know Amazon has sophisticated business on the corporate side, but the retail side must know a credit card expiration date to an old expired card?I authenticated all other information correctly.  So my account exists, but is not accessible by anyone?",1
"Horrible delivery, don't deliver up until 9pm. Left package at someone else's house, then took a dark photo at night showing delivered, but wasn't delivered! Terrible customer service, didnt sound too concerned",0
"Keeps charging me money even after several attempts to cancel my amazon video subscription. Only answer I get is ""sorry you're not in the system, we can't help you"" which sounds fishy cause they certainly have my credit card info...",0
Didn't get my refund despite them having to product back.,0
"Amazon is the mother of all online marketplaces ... and for some very solid reasons.1. 100% customer-centered. From the first page loading on their site to the shipping confirmation, Amazon treats every customer like a VIP. Awesome!2. Adapts and evolves with customers' needs. Unafraid to charter new territory, Amazon evolves with the ever-changing needs of its customers.3. Delivers your package on-time OR early. This is such a game-changer that Amazon has seriously disrupted the US Postal Service due to their unmatched delivery system. I could easily write 10 more pages about why Amazon is #1, but it really boils down to this: customer service. In a time where true customer service has become a rarity, Amazon is the undisputed leader.",2
"BEWARE BEWARE, I’ve been using Amazon for a few years and I’m about to cancel my membership due to never receiving the items I order online. They constantly send my deliveries to the wrong address and when you call to tell them about it, they don’t seem to care. I guess they than got filthy rich and don’t care about the customers anymore.",0

"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has fine infrastructure (fast shipment, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1
I purchased a oil painting pai t by numbers.  Cost about $30.00 the seller is a third-party.  Amazon has not supported my efforts to get a refund.  I have not received my order. Its now 3 months ago.  Amazon has made it impossible to get a working phone number.  I guess this company gets to treat a customer anyway they want.,0
"Just got the glasses from Amazon and wow, I'm super impressed! Here's the scoop on why I'm all in with a 5-star rating:Quality is on point: Honestly, these glasses feel solid but don't weigh down my face. I've been wearing them all day, and it's like they're not even there. Plus, everything looks super sharp through the lenses.Honestly, buying glasses online was a bit of a gamble for me, but this turned out to be a total win. Comfortable, stylish, and they make everything look crystal clear. Couldn't ask for more!",2

"Ordered ""in stock"" VR Meta Quest 2 on 1st of January 2024., should be delivered in a month from Deutschland to Croatia! No change in order status for 2 weeks, I contact support, they say ""it will be dispatched on 2nd of February""... I say OK.4th of February, still nothing. Contact support, they say to cancel it and order again with EXPEDIENT DELIVERY, and I'll receive full shipping refund when item arrives - in the MIDDLE OF MARCH!THIS IS 5H1T, so they have my 360€ for item which STILL didn't change status (11th of Feb) and I'll expect to receive it 2 and a half months after it's order.Crap company, crap leadership, 5h1tty BEZOS or JASSY, they get the money and ride the wave of established and fine company while having it's service dumped to that of A DEAD CORPSE.Unfortunately, their wealth can't diminish no matter what happens with service, and no one cares about your experience as a customer.UPDATE 2024-03-16:On 12th of March I was assured by customer service that delivery is on 13th of March. Today it's 16th and they send me the same thing as always ""delay in delivery, expected date is 23rd of APRIL"". Another month?What to say? If it was local shop with such service, it would be closed.UPDATE 2024-03-24:Talked with a customer service on 16th, the guy assured me that it will come asap (not on 23rd of April) and not to cancel the order. To check it in a week and if it doesn't change, then to cancel.SO, THREE FULL MONTHS I'm patient only to be screwed again and again with promises.Silly me, cancelling it now, avoiding Amazon for good, ordering item locally for 3% higher price which will be delivered in under a week.Thanks, bye",0
"Generally okay in my interaction. My only real issue is the stupid ""Try now pay later"" Wardrobe system. They took money out of my account instantly and i was told it would be refunded within 5-10 days. What is the point in the system if i'm just going to be charged straight away? I'm not gonna use the system if i had the money to pay for it there and then, am i? If i wasn't to be refunded until the 10th day then i'm effectively paying for the item twice until the refund is issued. The scheme, to me, just sounds like I'm giving Amazon a small loan. Bloody stupid.",1
Amazon.com turning into a low level online shopping source and negative overall experience. Delayed orders. Lost orders. Wrong orders. Questionable product authenticity. Dog and pony show customer service chat dialog. Place is no longer what it once was. Prices aren't even that competitive. Pushing Prime membership relentlessly. Maybe that's the problem.  Not a member not a customer ,0
"Recently when I call Amazon customer service I cannot understand the agent that is answering the phone.  I have nothing against any other nationality, we are all human beings and must work to make a living. Amazon has every right to employ agents around the world, however they should have those agents assist the country they are from.  It makes for better communications all around.  When a customer cannot understand what an agent is trying to tell them mistakes can happen.  At one point in my conversation the agent said she would cancel my order and then correct the quantity in a new order.  This would delay the product that I purchased. I subscribe to Amazon Prime for the free quick shipping.  The last thing I need is someone changing my order because I couldn't understand what they are saying. Finally, if Amazon were to hire agents in their respective countries it would help the economy in each country and not take it away from another country. This contributes to stable employment and a sound economy for all.",0
we live in a rural area and Amazon provides us a way to get what we need quickly and delivered directly to our door.  Saves us enormous amounts of time and gas every day!,2
"There is room for improvement - but they do a fine job in general and it shows in the number of customers. The price increase for prime is a bummer. please introduce a tiered approach - like those who want prime video can pay more, while those who just want fresh can pay a different amount.",1

Very quick speedy delivery service and problems dealt with extremely quickly,2
I had a $100 gift voucher given to me as a present and was horrified to find I couldnt transfer the value to the uk site. To use it in the .com site involved more money than the goods in shipping. Sad to say voucher stays on the account. Motto of the story is unless you want amazon to benefit from your money or your American living in America dont give their vouchers. Their customer service people dont answer questions so I presume they dont read them.,0
"This is my first stop for all my needs. I've ordered baby supplies, toys, groceries, and things for myself from this site. I've definitely saved a lot of money. They are a company who usually honors their deals, as far as I know. I've also gotten things saying that they were delivered but were not received by me. Amazon has always given me refunds, without any suspicion. The only thing I don't like about it is now they have a lot of distracting ads for external websites.",2
"Amazon is dropping the great customer support they use to have by allowing sellers to dictate the length of time to get your refund whenever an item is Not received, instead of issuing a gift card with credit one has to wait for about 7+/- days to receive money which you had already paid..unacceptable customer support and decent use of public funds if you multiply every customer",1
I can't see that there's anything to complain about Amazon.  I keep the UPS driver very busy so I know what I'm talking about. 😁🙂Great company to deal with in every way.,2
"Important update on Amazon help desk. Amazon Support 1-858 (666)-(0943),Phone number for Accounts and Billings office is open Mon-Fri at Salinas CA.I have been with Amazon for approximately 4 years. I purchased items as I usually do and all of a sudden my account were on a ""security hold."" This had not happened since I set up the account, which makes sense. Unfortunately for me, customer support would not explain why there was a ""security hold"" on my account when nothing had changed. They just told me I had to wait 8 days to recover my account. Excellent customer support and accountability for what they do with your account.",1

They are faulty as there is excess lining in one leg making them difficult to get on. Tried to return them but they are stated as ""not eligible for return"". Their returns policy does not explain anything. This is against my statutory rights and I cannot get any explanation or  information from Amazon as to how to return them and get a refund. Spoke to Amazon on their CHAT line which is automated just to get confirmation that the goods are not eligible for return. Still don't know why. Will not be buying clothes from Amazon again.",0
"The general convenience and order assistance I've received has always been great. Though I've had two separate issues with being able to leave reviews. The first was I was randomly not allowed to do so. The second was that a review had been taken down with no more than a vague explanation, and a link to all their rules, which isn't helpful for letting me alter my review to follow reviewer standards. This also makes me concerned of the validity of customer reviews and how they're filtered though.I also spent a while seeing if I could reach customer support without either calling, or being in active conversation with them and no luck. Can't stand companies that intentionally make it difficult to contact them.",1
amazon is great but what get me mad is that IF YOU AIN'T IN THERE PROGRAM . you can't write no reviews or they band you from writing reviews. I am honest person and I show video/pictures of the items and still got band.,1
Delivery sucks and customer service is worse,0
"I have been an Amazon customer for several years now. Since Covid hit I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars with them. Throughout the entire shutdown Amazon NEVER missed a order date. In the past several months it has gone SERIOUSLY DOWN HILL!! What is going on?? If you can not deliver an item on time then why do you even put a order day on the items? It's ridiculous. I pay for PRIME SERVICE but I am no longer getting it. Sorry, but I don't go for that crap. When I order a item and it specifically gives me a date of arrival BEFORE I ORDER IT!! I consider that a contract! I pay for the assistance, I pay for the item...but do not receive my order on the promised date. In May of 2021 I had a little incident where some supplies for a customers order got damaged. I immediately ordered what I needed with the ""promise"" of it being delivered the next day. Sometime around 5:00pm (long after it should have already been delivered) I received a text message informing me that it would not be arriving when promised. It was to arrive on May 21st which still would have given me 2 1/2 days to complete my customers order which was to be delivered on the evening of Monday, May 24th.   I did not receive my supplies until the afternoon of May 24th!! Needless to say I could not deliver as promised because Amazon did not deliver as promised. The loss of that order cost me $300.00!! When I called to complain, they had the AUDACITY to offer me a $5.00 credit to my account. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!?? You cost me $300.00 and you want to compensate that with a $5.00 credit? Talk about a slap in the face. As a matter of fact that was and is THE ONLY time that Amazon had the courtesy of letting me know. Usually they do not even do that much. It's not until I see UPS drive past my house that I realize that something is wrong and then I have to check. They are also starting to get really cheap with their packaging. I have been ordering my makeup from Amazon for quite a while now. It used to come wrapped in bubble wrap in a box. There were no problems. Now they have been sending it in really thin and cheesy mail bags/envelopes and it arrives in pieces. One time they sent 2 glass bottle of foundation, 2 2 compacts of face powder and a tube of mascara all together in a paper shipping bag. Absolutely no padding, bubble wrap or anything!! Well after shipping and UPS throwing it around for a day and a half, I had a real mess on my hands. How much common sense does it actually take for someone to know that 2 glass bottles and some fragile makeup needs to be packed properly with padding and a box?? I see that Amazon sells Waterford Crystal and Austrian crystal wine glasses at $400.00 -$500.00 per half dozen. I can just imagine how they would arrive!! You NEED to get it together Amazon. Have you ever heard the saying ""Your mouth needs to stop writing checks that your ass can't cash!""",1
"If they had a zero star rating would be better.Amazon doesn’t help their customers in any way,will never use amazon again",0

Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
"My interaction with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the order company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
I won’t be using Amazon anymore either. Going to be deleting my account of over 10 years. Their customer service is terrible and they charged me early for a return. As I’m a truck driver I can’t always send something at my home right away and it said I had more time than what they gave me. I have screenshots even offered to send to them. Told them to keep the money from the defective item I need to send. It was the principle of how they’re doing businessI’ll stick with Walmart . online.,0
"To all,We have been Amazon clients for a very long time.We have just ordered an iPhone XV for our daughter...when we received the package, we gave the Amazon code to the delivery guy. The package was sealed with tape. When we opened it their was a Dove lotion bottle - clearly the same weight and size of the iPhone.We called right away the customer service but Amazon said that the package was delivered. They were not nice at all and after 5' of conversation did not seem to care. We had to send photos and we are awaiting their answer within 3 days. This is theft. It can only have taken place in their warehouse or while it was delivered but...someone somewhere must have known what was in the package - which means access to Personal Data! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.NEW SCAM - DO NOT ORDER iPHONE or anything expensive - Warehouse or delivery THEFT!",0
"Not sure why people are hating on Amazon, they are great to their customers. Returns - if they reverse your return, just reach out to Customer service and they will take care of it. There were some errors on their part but I appreciate that they email me if there is a return reversal. Most places don't tell you what's going on.I have Amazon Prime and use it for shopping at Whole Foods. The discount helps a lot. They are great to Prime members - their customer service is as good as Costco's if not better. (I quit my Costco membership.)",2
"I feel obliged to EDIT this review given latest update in this matter: I have increased the rating to three stars (previously 1 star) since I finally got assistance from another manager who acknowledged the mishandling of my case and compensated me for the mistakes. *Anything below this text is untouched* It bothers me when such a powerful and successful business continue to grow while they are actually not living up to their own greatness... So therefore I'm eager to write a review. (For the first time in my life). I also wrote one on ConsumerAffairs... Unfortunately I don't have acceptable things to say about Amazon and their attention to customer satisfaction seems below average, despite having so much attention in media about being the best and greatest company in the world. I ordered a spotting scope for my vacation. (NOTE: The item was shipped from and is sold by Amazon.com)I was searching for a certain spotting scope, and I finally found it in stock on Amazon. 14 left. So I order one ASAP. When I receive the package the next week I notice that they sent the wrong item. Well... that's a disappointment, but I would not bash a whole company just because of that. But... Then when trying to order the correct item (only ONE used sample left. fine.. ) I get an error message. I contacted Amazon and they promised me not to worry (like THREE times) and that they would fix it for me. So when they tell me not to worry that many times I trust them about getting this fixed. I get promised:1. They will make sure I will be able to order the correct item even though they seem to almost run out of stock. i.e. I assume they keep one for me. And they would get back to me when they fixed the glitch/error. I would also get 20 USD off.2. They will pick up the wrong item in 2 business day and give me a refund.Sounds great, right? Now I won't go to another company and order the correct item somewhere else, right? Outcome: 1. They DON'T get back to me. And when I reach out and ask them if they fixed the glitch so I could order the correct item they told me they could NOT, AND they have run out of stock. ..that's just great. 2. Also they STILL have not picked up the package and have yet not refund my purchase.So I contact Amazon again:After getting failed twice in a row and thus ruined my chance of getting hands on this quite rare item, I asked them how they were going to help me. Let me put it this way; they were NOT EVEN WILLING TO CHECK DELIVERY STATUS with the supplier about when they will get the item back in stock. LOL. And for the record, I've been acting very patient the whole time and have had a very decent tone in my writing to them the whole time.A normal, customer satisfaction oriented company would make more effort, but not Amazon. I expected them to provide me with perhaps the correct item that's sold from third party who has it in stock but with a price adjustment compensation (since they sold it for more money) or something similar.And even though one of the agents promised me to give me a price match in case they would change when coming back in stock, the manager I asked to speak to later on told me was misinformation and that they could not even do that. So in conclusion; Amazon failed to deliver correct item and are not willing to make any real effort to make sure I am satisfied as a customer. Hence, I will order the correct item from a competitor and let Amazon pick this wrong item up ASAP. While writing this they still have not picked up the wrong item nor refunded me. Which they initially told me would take two days. It has now been more than a week, and will take more than two weeks in total since I today asked the about this once again and told me 3-5 more business days. That's more than two business days, isn't it? Since the scope is about 1200 USD and since I ordered a new (correct one) from a competitor I will probably have to use my savings/sell shares to afford paying the upcoming amex bill. Just great...",1
"What can I say, everything I need all delivered straight to me and Mr Robot, wow that's really good!",2
Brilliant service from amazon everything we get from them are top quality and can't fault them qith being a prime member get everything next day always deliver,2
"the worst company I never want to work for these types of people from Amazon again, after working for them you will notice that you are treated like a slave they have the worst, incompetent and arrogant staff all the id..ts at amazon are bosses they came for a year at amazon, maybe  don't even speak English very well and they have come to believe that they are superior and important, some messes",0
"LOVE Amazon, however their prices are no longer competitive like they were when they started out, now that they get you hooked and you pay high prices. I have seen some things $100 higher at Amazon than at other other places and still get free shipping at the other places. If it was not for that Amazon would always be my first choice I don't love Amazon that much",0
Nice website.Easy return and fine customer care.,1
"I’m truly shocked by this cumulative rating! How have people had this many bad experiences with Amazon?I purchased regularly from Amazon and I’m a prime member. I’ve never had issues with returns that couldn’t be resolved with a phone call. I have received hundreds of excellent products through their site.I’m not thrilled that they have a monopoly in this industry, but their innovation has made our lives easier. It’s amazing they can deliver products on the same day you order. And with no fee! I’ve been able to order items that I’d never find in a local store.I don’t love that. The majority of their products are made in China. But that’s true for every brick and mortar store as well. It isn’t Amazon‘s fault that factories have been outsourced to another country.I love that anyone who wants to order from Whole Foods can do so through Amazon. I’ve done this once and it was helpful.The return process couldn’t be easier. The length of time allowed for returns around the Christmas holiday is wonderful. I do wish they’d allow a longer window for returns during the rest of the year. With such high sales volume it would likely create chaos though.I’m a fan even if I don’t agree with all of their practices. Thank you for making my daily life more manageable.",2
"Package never arrived, but the customer service rep was very kind and understanding. He got me a replacement in 24 hours. 5 Stars are for that particular customer service rep. Very impressive service.",2

"Amazon Pickup Mix-Up 1/3/22I had two packages that were supposed to be shipped out to UPS, one of which was an Amazon return and the other of which would not go through. The package that did not go through contained photos I needed to get developed for a music festival I took pictures for. I owed the organizer images, as I was on the media team for the event. These were to be sent to Georgia. I called UPS to fix the issue with the latter package, and then the following day, someone came to pick up a package. I gave him the film in error, thinking UPS must have solved my issue, only to realize that he came for the Amazon return, not for the film.Calls 1/3/22Following this realization, I proceeded to call UPS, whose representative told me they could do nothing, and bounced me to Amazon, whose representative also told me they could do nothing. I asked her if they could leave something that would let the Amazon shipping center in Virginia (where it was headed) that when they got the package it should be returned to me. She said that Amazon had no such system and I would need to wait until the [package made it to the facility. I asked her if she could put me through to the facility in Virginia so I could tell them myself. She said she had no such ability. I asked if she could transfer me to someone who could contact them. She explained that there was no such person. I thanked her for her time and called UPS again. This time, UPS said they would issue an interception order to stop the package from arriving. I thanked the representative and concluded the call, feeling relieved.Calls 1/4/22The following day, I awoke to find a message from my Amazon app which stated that a refund was applied to my account for my return. Frustrated, I called Amazon again and spoke to someone about the issue. I explained the situation and asked if she could get the package sent back to me. She explained that she was sorry, but the person who spoke to me last gave me false information. There was, in fact, a system of tickets that could be created to notify a shipping facility of a package that should be returned to the sender upon arrival. She told me that since the package arrived at the facility that morning, it has likely been opened, inspected, and the contents thrown away without me being notified. I explained to her that this was a departure from what the other representative told me and that the pictures on the film were for a music festival and were irreplaceable She apologized and said she would file a ticket anyway, just in case, but that I should expect to not get my pictures back. Despite the package being there already (complete with a shipping label and tracking number to aid in its location), she said it would take up to 15 days for the facility to even view the ticket, meaning my package would likely be long gone. She sighed and stated that things ""could have been very different"" if the first Amazon representative gave me the correct information. I asked why the system takes 15 days when packages are delivered sometimes in less than 2 days. She did not have an answer to this question. Frustrated, I explained that what was originally a mixup due to my lapse of memory has become the imminent loss of irreplaceable photo work and film rolls which were valued at a combined $45. I asked who I should speak to to get compensation for this incident in the event that I never get my film rolls back. She said that there was no such department and that Amazon would not offer compensation because the rolls were no Amazon products. I thanked her for her time and concluded the call. Less than 10 minutes later, I called Amazon support again. I was determined to do everything I could to get my package back. The third representative told me some of the information the second representative gave me was incorrect. She explained that once the package is received by the facility, it is not opened immediately but is rather thrown in a pile with packages to be sorted. According to her, it could take the aforementioned 15 days to find the package and a whole month to return it to me if they succeeded in locating it. She too, however, stated that there was a chance I would never receive it, before doubling back and sending me an email that stated I would get a confirmation email when the package was found.AftermathI am beyond frustrated with Amazon Customer Service. I was given a wealth of false information and every representative had something different to say than the last. No information was consistent and I have barely been given any real help. I am now gearing up for another call to Amazon, in an attempt to speak to a supervisor of some sort. I pray this will bring some sort of positive conclusion to this incident. Those pictures are unbelievably important to myself and my roll as a designated photographer for the festival.",0
I have had an Amazon account for years. Now all of a sudden when I try to place an order they send me a notice that there is suspicious activity on my account and shut everything down. I have been double charged for an order I have not received and other orders cancelled. My order history has been deleted. I have spent hours over several days trying to get my account straightened out. Now I am going to delete my account and take my business elsewhere.,0
User friendly; hassle free.,2
My experience with Amazon is great delivery is on point and there refunds are great too and you get your money back without sending the defective item back,2
I pay for prime and its normally decent but recently deliveries have gone missing or been broken they also have proved they don't check sizes from third party sellers as I bought an item listed as UK large and received Chinese large which is basically a UK small. Customer assistance have been shocking and rude.,1
Been getting  better luck with Amazon lately so I'm editing my response. Been finding some decent deals on here. Still don't like the way they pack packages.,1
very pleased with my product and would use tooled up again as they were very quick and the karcher window cleaner is very good would recommend to all my friends,2
amazon is a acceptable platform for B2b bussines.,1

"I was trying to reset my password, but I got locked from resetting it. So I contacted the support team, with the support chat from another account. Where I got told by the person that after 24 hours my account would be unlocked, so I could reset my password so I waited but after 24 hours I was still locked. So I contacted the support where I got told they will transfer me to the department there could help me and the person I got transferred to tells me they couldn't do anything, so I had to talk with their support over my phone, but there could be international charges which I don't want to get so now I'm stuck using my other account.",0
"I have used Amazon for many years and overall, have always been pleased with the results. Quality is generally very good and I keep the products that I buy. I love the included 2-day shipping with Prime, as well as other benefits such as Prime video. I also like how easy it is to return a product - just drop it off at your local kohls and you're set - boom, super easy! With that said, Amazon is not perfect. When I've needed to get a hold of customer support, they have been very helpful, however, it's not always clear as to how to get a hold of someone. I will also say, Amazon does have a significant issue with allowing knock-offs to run rampant on their site. You can tell the copycats and knock-offs apart if you know how to look, but it is misleading and hurts legitimate, honest business owners.",2
Power SaversDespite being fraudulent Amazon have listed five power saving devices on their web pages.  The extravagant claims for these devices are based on incomplete knowledge of anything to do with electrical power consumption measurements.. Save 50-75% on your Energy Bill  what utter utter frauds.  Amazon of course  don't make only sell them as a drop shop.  M E Denton Lincoln UK,1
"Ordered a package that said it was fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for prime shipping.... then it gave me some stupid 2 week away window..... They shipped through this absolute joke of a company called landmark global (if you search for them you find nothing but poor reviews on this scumbag cancerous operation).... they shipped within 2 days to New York (I am in Alberta Canada) then it sat there for 2 weeks! suffice to say they blew right through their ""window"" I called Amazon to see what the hell was going on as I needed the goods ordered.... both agents were less than useful and hard to understand, they told me to wait another week!, finally after 4 days it updated that it has shipped to ontario and god knows how much longer it will be.... I order a lot of stuff through amazon so this disaster of an experience is making me second guess that decision, not impressed at all. what a joke.",0
I have ordered a charger because i lost the original one. I bought Ptron 17W charger it is working noe. it last only 20 days. the product quality of Amazon is worst.,0
"Just received my latest order from Amazon.  As always, it came promptly, well packed and at the right price.  How a business should be!",2
"I was shocked! You aren’t able to write a negative review on purchases.  I had trouble with a purchase and titled my review...”buy at your own risk”.  I said that “I ordered an item the 1st part of July and after 3 weeks I contacted the seller to say it hadn’t been received and was told it was shipped, but never got any other communication  from the seller after that.”  Amazon said I couldn’t post a review like that.  I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.",1
Got my items as described on their site. Happy customer :),1
I have just had a delivery from amazon my wife and my self have had over 50 items of them since start of this year and i must say they have been outstanding and so help full and there delivery people have all ways been polite,2
Excellent service and prompt delivery. Secure packing.,2
Amazon can be acceptable but when its average its average. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
My package was supposed to be delivered on Sunday which has not arrived yet. I keep getting is excuses when I call. This is highly frustating and worst service i ever had with Amazon. Please do not use amazon services for delivery since their agent might steal the products order by customers like us and they customers have to call amazon and inquire about products.,0
Buyer beware!! Be aware that Amazon returns that show when you are making a purchase that it will be free is an untrue statement. The free return is nothing more than a shipping label or QR code. Amazon has found a way to charge for returns and hit the purchaser with a restocking fee even if an item is an absolutely perfect condition. So ultimately your refund is less than your purchase price and Amazon doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. I have to believe that Amazon got as big as they did as quick as they did by doing nothing more than take unnecessary money from the common people who can literally not afford to be charged undisclosed fees. The practice of saying free shipping and free returns is not what they are providing so that is either bait and switch or certainly unethical.,0
"Decent website. For the most part I can find what I want with relative ease. Not all goodss there are the best prices, so you have to really shop around. It's not easy to get live support from them anymore. They have put blocks into place to make it harder to find a way to contact them.",1
Super Slow Delivery... A bit disappointed,1
"I placed an order for a dress. Upon receiving it,  I discovered I received a completely different item than what I ordered. I then spoke to an associate who said it could not be exchanged but I could place a new order with express shipping. Then the price difference of express shipping and sale (the item was on sale when I bought it) would also be refunded. Logical since this was not my fault nor responsibility. I made a copy of the chat where they promised this. After multiple weeks and I think 7 times contacting them about this whole order, I still haven’t received the price difference back!! Multiple things went wrong with the order and I contacted them three times about not receiving the price difference back. Two of the three times the associate again promised the refund was being processed and I should receive it within 3-5 days. Now today another associate (Asad) said they can only offer store credit!!!! So first of all: three associates promised a refund in money of the price difference. Where the first even emphasized to use express shipping since the whole thing was not my fault. 2. The mistake of receiving a completely different item should not affect the customer anymore than it already has 3. The amazon associates are completely incompetent since they cannot even read the chats properly and you have to explain the situation again and again4. I expect my money back and not some store credit which I dont use, especially not now. It’s common sense that when a store (independent sellers or not) makes a mistake, they fix it and the customer should not have to suffer or pay extra for it. Moreover, the response of the last associate was absolutely ridiculous.Be warned if you order at Amazon!",0
Good one... Products are decent,1
"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer assistance used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer assistance but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",1
Excellent. Everything that is fulfilled by Amazon arrives in timely fashion. Customer queries and service is second to none. Amazon prime service for deliveries has been a life saver on many occasions. Amazonnfamily is fantastic too. Allows you to share everything in the household,2
Great company and great service. Any small problems I have had with the company they have been easy to contact and my problem has been sorted and I have been compensated for. One of the few online company's that I trust,2
"I wish a one star was possible. This is the third time amazon has taken unauthorised money from my account, and then said it does not show up in their system. I have emailed, after emailed, and the service is absolute trash, especially for stealing my money. What is this? A company? Or one for money laundering?Do your job. Don't steal money.",0
"If possible, I wish I could give the stupid Amazon Au a negative rather then 1 star.This is my first time order and I believe will also be my last.I bought a camera on Amazon, and around 5 hours after receiving a order confirmation, I missed the call from Amazon as I was driving. After that I received a email stating that my account was temporarily on hold due to the suspicious purchase,  They ask me to provide evident that the card I used for th payment is mine. Ofcouse. It is mine, I upload the screenshot and my bankstatement where my card is linked. After try to upload 8 times, I receive the email that they believe it is necessary to close my account and cancel my order. Well, if I enter the wrong card no. Or ccv, at least let me make the payment again. After account frozen , can not do nothing including contact the fk Amazon. End up with Rudely close my account! Go to hell. Pleas delete all the customer account and close yourself forever!",0
"Do not use amazon the delivery drivers will not deliver to your house if they can't park and will blame it on you and you will loose out, no details to call and delivery company not on there list of numbers so now I can't do anything about it, absolutely the most useless site iv been on, 3 orders and 3 problems",0
Can you justify why they’re several of your current employees that think it’s ok to attack customers outside their own homes or people being attacked on the street by your employees merely for asking if they need help. Also how can you justify that you used to adervtise the sale of sex dolls based on the appearance of children,0
No respect for the parcel and being delivered by just throwing it over a gate as if there rubbish.This is not the first time and trying to make contact with amazon is a joke unless you want one of there Faq's answered. The company just doesnt care like there drivers.,0
"I would never expect such a global company to have such a cheap and absolutely disappointing customer service representative's communication. The waiting time was over whole ONE HOUR, I could not believe it. And The customer representative had a very poor English which took me hours to understand what she was trying to explain me, furthermore, she did not know what she was doing, kept putting me on hold to reply to every single question I asked. I hope I will never have to deal with amazon customer service again. Horrible! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME AMAZON!",0
"Absolutely the worse company ever. Professional scam artists who treat sellers like sh-it and take their money. What kind of policy is this when a customer receives a refund if the item sent out is one day late???? Not only do they refund the customer, the customer keeps the item! Amazon should be shutdown and take court for stealing. A-Z claims is joke. They question you about your performance when you are 0.1% over their 1% threshold. Why am I not performing? It because you keep granting cases for buyers for no fk-ing reason and suspending my account because you want a utility bill and then take 3 months to reply back and grant access to my own money and account. Go fk yourself Amazon!",0
I was told that after giving a month of my time on the kindle challenge that I would receive a $5 kindle credit. Unfortunately they didn't tell me I had to pay the taxes. Nice one Amazon. You've done it again. Screw over everyone and hopefully you will get it back in karma.,0
"I have ordered several items from Amazon, each time the doorbell has rung but when I open the door no one is there and my package has been left on the doorstep!!!! Not happy as it wouldn't matter if it was a  ' T-shirt' or food to leave ANYTHING on a doorstep is reprehensible.",0
"Ive been an amzon.ca customer since 2015 when they were new and just finding a place on the map.  Back then they really cared about their customers and stepped up their customer service and care to a whole new level.Much like most companies they forget about who made them big (the consumers) and their service fell by the waste side.Its now a company thats gotten to big for its britches and cares very little if your happy with their service or not.I pay prime fees and my parcels are well past their delivery time at the best of times.My son tried amazon, he said never again!..reason my mothers day order was placed well in advance, the day it was suppose to arrive it was canceled as product was damaged (4 items) his money was refunded but that provided him little comfort as mothers day was in two days in a lock down.  They blamed it on the seller and offered NOTHING for his inconvenience not even to expedite the same things.They are never accountable for things that go wrong and never try to rectify it anymore...this leaves a bad taste in my mouth! I use to rave about them...not so much anymore.  I myself keep looking for the next amazing company that cares for its consumers ...mean while i have started shopping more locally and doing curb side to try and eliminate my frustration with amazon.",0

"It was a time when Amazon was a really decent company,  but now it seems to be just another one just like the other. One of my problems I have with them is their order.  I'm a prime member and have been for years but now that doesn't matter to Amazon.  We order often and our home sits slightly up off of the street in a cul de sac and we have the ring and it shows them delivering. I have called, complained and also written instructions with orders and on the account not to walk in the yard on the grass but only walk on the driveway. Well no one cares and they park at the driveway and walk straight through our yard which is well taken care of. Years back they never did this and they have no respect for the customers property.  I will be canceling my prime and shop for what I need elsewhere. ",1
"Won't honour their own prices. I've been a big customer for years. Today I closed my membership. An item I bought, in sale, was £140 less hours later. I asked for a refund (before it was delivered) and was told that they don't price match. I did say, its only price matching with yourself.I needed the item urgently for work so couldn't return and reorder, which is weirdly what they said that I could do???? Just refund the difference. They wouldn't so I won't be a customer again. Weird policy. It meant that I don't feel like a valued business customer.",1

"Amazon works well if things are standard.  However, the moment an issue becomes non-standard, you enter customer support hell.  I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.",1

It is a good and easy website,2
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime assistance, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1
I really love amazon prime.  Never really had any issues with them.  I did get automatically billed the other day which I was not aware of.  Later found out that it’s an automatic bill cycle once every year.  I guess I should have read that.  Maybe you can guys can send out a reminder on when this is due?  Other than that the service has been awesome for my small business.,2
dealing with used items can be a nightmare sometimes. The used listings often don't contain enough info and item overview to give you an idea about the condition.,1
Can't claim VAT back on items due to my disability.. They always ignore letters even when sent by recorder delivery need to highlight this in the house of Commons.,0
The worst site ever for trying to change info details .. change email spent two hours trying and edit fail edit fail edit fail.. I'm done with this poor service poor site.. besides the last item I ordered was delivered broke and they did nothing about it..,0
I'm on a call with Amazon now about a return and the advisor on the call has one of the best customer services telephone manners. I've experienced similar with Amazon before as well so appears like a consistent thing. Great to know they've kept their customer first tradition.,2
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the order. Then they give you an approximate order date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1

NOT ONE is positive, the company is despised and yet you insist on using them and losing customers because of it. Prime membership is a joke, as is guaranteed delivery date. SO close to closing my account!!",0
Has been consistently efficient and I have been using them for years. Amazon almost always has the lowest prices too!,2
Their prices aren't really too competitive anymore. The shipping has gotten pretty ordinary shipping through USPS. Common sense says not to ship through such a dysfunctional government run shipment support. I've had packages delayed and even packages not show up when shipped through USPS when ordering from Amazon. When they use their own shipment people and UPS or Fedex there's no problem. But since things get shipped through USPS there's no way to get compensation or any kind of resolution to USPS's incompetency.,1
"I've had an average interaction with Amazon.com. The site offers a vast selection of items, and it's generally easy to find what I'm looking for. However, there have been a few instances where the order was delayed, which was quite frustrating.The customer support is decent, but there have been times when resolving issues took longer than expected. Prices are usually competitive, but occasionally I find better deals elsewhere. Overall, Amazon.com is convenient for many purchases, but there is definitely room for improvement in their order and customer support supports.",1
"items stolen AGAIN!! This is not the first time .. have installed a delivery box and still the items are left by the door , so even put written instructions on the delivery box and the door nope still the same ... so delivery drivers cant read??? Do they not have to pass a crime check??Have been told latest scam is delivery driver takes a picture then tells his mates where to go .. BUT legally you can claim a refund or replacement as LAW state this is not been delivered if left on door step , that's why the drivers say handed to resident which again is not proof of delivery ... im cancelling anything to do with amazon prime , alexas are going in the bin the company has got so corrupt with its ""AI"" bull crap all that is, is a way to watch and listen more to you, AMAZON your a disgrace with incompetence drivers who steal and con us and you ... BUT hey you need a heart to care !!!!!!!",0
"I am so disappointed in Amazon's declining service and increasing prices.  Shipping is taking longer with less prime delivery choices and increased product prices and membership fee. Prime video choices had been free or reasonable, but the fees are now ridiculous!  Will not renew my prime membership this year after many years.",0
"I been a customer for 10 years and they continue to do the right thing every time. Recently, I bought a heavy scooter for my son and he could not use it. They took it back without questions asked. Amazing service.",2
I’ve never had an issues with them. For someone who has issues finding stuff that my son likes amazon is the place to go,2
"Shopping online used to scare me a lot. However since I've found Amazon I'm not scared anymore. They are the biggest online shopping portal ,the friendliest and the most easy to use. I use Amazon almost every week and their speed delivery option is simply fantastic.  I once had a problem with my product and contacted the customer service department and was greeted by a customer service rep in less than 10 minutes. They solved my problem and was offered a brand new product which was delivered in a few days.",2
Amazon.com is a very dependable company that delivers quickly and efficiently. A very trustworthy company.,2
Very pleased everytime I use Amazon.,2

"Amazon is ok, but their couriers are not.  I have had an A4 book folded in half to fit in a letterbox as they could not be bothered to knock on the door.  A package that was to fat to fit through letterbox was left poking out of the door.  Don't shop from them unless the item won't fit through the letterbox however much the lazy driver rams it.",1
"Amazon: When placing order, CHECK if from Market Place Seller or Amazon .. Free Shipping is not Free",1
Usually the service is excellent and very quick. On the few occasions where there has been a problem Amazon have been quick to sort it out.,2
"Amazon often, but not always, tries to make things right when something goes wrong. When it doesn't try, it's kind of a disaster, but I've had more decent usages than ordinary.ordinary usages have included 1) getting dropped from their referral platform for absolutely no reason (accused of violating platform policy); 2) having packages stolen from my porch and having CS ghost me in trying to figure out a resolution; 3) having third party sellers shirk responsibility for problems and having Amazon tell me it's not their fault, or 4) selling fake items or lying about material content or other configuration.In general, I think they're better than plenty of their peers.",1
I used to love Amazon. I would get my packages in 2 days and delivered to the right spot. The last several months has changed my view. In the last month they have lost 5 of my packages and they were to be delivered by Amazon and not a third party. I also have special instructions on my packages to leave them in an area I have designated for deliveries. I have a large dog who can not go in the designated area so my packages and the drivers are safe. Amazon drivers do not follow the instructions so my dog goes after them and/ or destroys or goes pee on my packages. I'm tired of talking to customer service about the same issues over and over. My Prime membership will not be renewed this year.,0
Since joining Amazon been getting scam calls everyday. Won’t ever use again,0
"My go to online shop. I have never been wronged by Amazon and I've been buying from them for years now. They always get my items to me on time but usually, faster than expected. Love em!",2
"I love amazon and shop with them all the time,  they are a real blessing to me, because I am in a wheelchair. great prices, too.  now, excuse me, please:  gotta go use some nail stuff I bought on amazon.",2
"Not a huge fan, but I can see the decent aspects of the company. They just don't really tick all my boxes.",1
Free shipping is acceptable,1
Bye Amazon. Didnt use a lot 5-8 times a year. I dont deal with unethical companies such as yours.,0
"Amazon online shopping app is absolutely hopeless. Just because I had the audacity to change my payment details, this ridiculous website, refused to recognise my old details,  my new details, my old password, all new passwords,  and my email addresses !Awful Amazon's woeful website, is a bunch of bilge.",0
"Bought an item with next day delivery (Prime) and after no information on second day I called Customer Service. It's probably easier to get a bill through congress than to get to a human! Since it is a shipping problem they can't answer any questions. Not allowed access. Mid discussion I get an email that it will arrive tomorrow. It is coming from an Amazon facility 15 miles from my house and takes three days. When I ask what happened all I get is here is a discount on a future purchase and when transferred to a supervisor by the very courteous CS rep I get a very rude supervisor who informs me that she can't do anything about shipping. (Funny, I thought that the shipping was the number one value of Amazon.)",0
It is really decent for shopping!,1
I have purchased a couple of times from Amazon and have always recieved the gear eventually.,1
"Usually 5 as a prime customer but not very happy recently. Made me wait nearly 2 months for face masks I have been wearing them since beginning of March with disposable gloves and goggles when going out as they are helpful to helping prevent not entirely the risk of infection when going out. I understand things are difficult but these are priority items and should not be delayed. Luckily since Lockdown started I am not going out much only for food shopping as food shopping online is impossible. Usually very decent having purchased face masks, a digital thermometer for my mother which came with a dead battery ( I had to change it) but it works fine for her now. And for a number of law books for me which they have normally been very decent at order and the Flash Speed mop which I tried to get in stores but gave up and got it in Amazon. I do like Amazon but on one occasion items have been delivered to next door instead of our address and it's a decent job they are honest neighbours. Good but could be better as my items are unnecessarily being delayed by up to a month now as a Prime customer with essential items they should not be delayed.",1
So far this is the BEST online purchasing site.I loved their way of  customer handling and return as well as refund policy.If there is delay then they inform time to time.,2
"Terrible delivery, down for 1430-1630never arrived. Rescheduled for up to 10pm yet driver per Amazon tracker passed within 0.5miles my address twice before heading off elsewhere. Rechecked at 2000hrs driver been sat at costa coffee for 1.5hrs. 2100hrs still no delivery.Called customer service who although polute couldnt or wouldnt help resolve when delivery would take place. No contact with driver available no map tracker update available per service representative. Thoroughly dissatisfied at the professionalism of this company. As a courier man myself you dont send a driver with hundreds of pounds worth of parcels out and have no way of contacting them. Pathetic excuses.......",0
Driver just opened front door rather than wait for someone to answer. Why is the driver evening trying the door. Contacted Amazon but support is non existent.,0
Always uses USPS even after reporting that we were having issues with them. Packages always lost cos they leave them a block away from our house.,1
I opurchase some lite bulbs from Amazon recently and the service was good. One was broken on arival  and they replaced straight away. Thanks.,2
Overall amazon have been pretty acceptable but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as ordinary as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,1
a terrible interaction. a poorly designed website,1
"Hands down THE best customer service I've experienced online. I'm in Denmark and have been buying goods from the German Amazon for about a decade now.I've just been given my latest refund, which was for an awful Logitech MX Keys keyboard which luckily had one of its keys fall off after about 18 months, meaning I was still under warranty. I hoped to then be able to sell the brand-new replacement for a decent amount and buy a better keyboard, but Amazon just offered a full refund, which I happily accepted.I've had returns on close to ten orders, some of which have been swiftly closed with ""refund issued, no need to return the item,"" the others returned with a prepaid parcel slip that just needs to be printed and stuck on the box, and once they've received the item back, a refund has been issued.Once I bought twelve bottles of baby oil (enough to get free shipping), and it was delivered damaged with three bottles having escaped through a hole. I called the local carrier and was put in queue as number 90-something. While waiting I checked the Amazon website and discovered the option to have Amazon call you up. I activated it and was immediately called on my phone by an employee who promptly refunded me money for the three missing bottles, no questions asked. The local carrier called me back two hours later.This last refund was set in motion by the friendliest German supporter who laughed with me at my broken German and did his best to follow my better English.If there's one negative, it's that the search function on their own website is basically useless, so I have to use Google with ""site:amazon.de"" added to the query instead.I see many negative reviews based on having been fooled by refund scammers, fake websites, or forgetting your password and blaming Amazon, hating on Bezos (which I agree with), or some other random own-fault issue.I've spent at least 10k € over a decade and NEVER had a bad experience with them.People, if someone randomly calls you up and say they're from Amazon (or any other business), hang up the phone and block that number.

"When ever I need something, a book, a hairbrush, a video....groceries what have you...they have it and generally at a better price! I even got my bed from them. Customer service is always professional and quick!",2

"This is a second review I am writing for Amazon, in order to clarify their biased reviews filtering and complete lack of transparency in regard to users' opinions showing various item defects.I have attempted to publish a review regarding the dysfonctionality of Victron Energy MPPT 75 15 BT device. Three times. With video pointing the defect. None of the three attempts were ever published and no feedback was returned to me regarding the potential reasons for refusal. ",1
"Their customer service application on their website is absolutely dire, none existent. There is no customer service application that is fit for purpose apart from a list that you can click on which is almost worthless; no customer services phone number, no customer services email you can actually engage with that is directly on there site, no complaints platform you can actually use. This company has ballooned into a monstrous entity that it has forgotten about customer services completely. They have ditched the core principles that the ""Customer is King"" and the ""Customer is the life blood of your business"". I'm starting to go off buying Amazon shopping because there is no proper avenue to give your grievance to, no proper customer service you can ask for help. Amazon doesn't care about (us) their customers'. Recent experiences using Amazon shopping on line has left me very frustrated with their systems. I ordered goods from them to arrive at an Amazon pick up hub, they send me a code to open the hub locker but it won't open. I spent 3 days trying to open it. What was worse I couldn't contact an Amazon services customer advisor because there isn't one, just a computer offering basic general questions that couldn't answer what I wanted answering. If I had a telephone number or an email then that would of helped my frustration but instead I'm left there standing frustrated that I had no idea why I couldn't access the hub and my parcels. But hey let's talk about global warming shall we! Now a van has to pick up my parcel send it back to the depot, then as I THINK about reordering my parcel another van has to pollute the air twice to get it to me; so much for Amazon's environmental policy well that is just a joke. Come on Amazon get a grip with customer services, stop making US the customers do all your dirty work and stop adding vehicle fumes to the environment unnecessarily transporting parcels back and forth when a customer services team can help reduce that problem. Very poor customer services. I'm shopping more and more on the high Street because I'm increasingly becoming more frustrated with Amazon shopping experiences.",0

"I’m just gonna give this an average. I mean like, the customer support is decent and that but when I order things, it sometimes wouldn’t come to my door which is kinda a problem. But it’s still a decent company! Don’t ditch it!",1
Its the best eCommerce business. I get to find items for half the cost and get to see other reviews before purchasing the item.,2
"I believe that Amazon is in the process of going out of business. Several items recently were either damaged, wrong item (wrong box…) or expired. I suspect this has something to do with dissatisfied employees- because they should recognize what they are shipping out. When you push employees to work like robots, this was bound to happen eventually. Fortunately, Now most manufactures will mail directly (which was not the case several years ago), so it’s not really a problem as a customer to make the change. We just have to recognize the time has come. I do believe it is mostly to do with the greed of Jeff Bezos.",0

they are awsome . great staff,2
"Get so fed up with Amazon.  I pay annually for the 'privilege' of free next day delivery etc. Nine times out of 10 I get to checkout and find that the goods offered as next day delivery could actually be any number of days, even weeks away.  Today I've been waiting for a small package which should be delivered by 10pm, it's now 9.20pm and tracking shows it's not even despatched!  Amazon customer dis-service robot says it will  be delivered today although they only have the same information that I  have. Tomorrow I  shall receive the usual ""it's been delayed"" email from Amazon and I  will refuse to take delivery when it eventually arrives. There's no compensation for lost or delayed items, we pay for a poor, unwieldy service.   Not good enough Amazon!",0
I hope it is free on this site to write a review seeing as amazon you have to spend $50 with your card to be able to write a review. Now if I go to one of these fast food places order a cookie and not like it or whatever reason I can write a review for free or the cost of the cookie but seriously 50 dollars to write a review is b.s,0
"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer assistance woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer assistance calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after order before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other items minutes after order.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1

Been a prime member for years now and I can’t really say anything bad about the service they offer for such a small monthly subscription.

"We literally could not live without them, they have turned shopping from a chore into a fun experience and let us do it all from home. Almost every product on prime arrives exactly when it’s supposed to and any that do not are not the fault of Amazon. Selection is amazing, I think a more identified mark should be listed for 3rd party sellers like the mark for prime, most third party stores are top notch but I’ve seen some scams out there and when I tried to report them it fail’s sometimes. If you stick with Amazon stuff and not blame them for the delivery company issues you will have no problems ever. I cannot for the life of me understand why the overall rating isn’t close to 5 stars",2

"WARNING:Just a word of warning.I've ordered lots of things from Amazon and only had 2 or 3 failures.  However, I feel that I should warn people that if your item is coming in from anywhere in the world, including Europe, customs randomly check items and if they are over just £18 in value, they levy a surcharge.  I've just been told that my item won't be released unless I pay £32.  The item itself was £52 and I paid £52 for delivery.  That means that costs have now exceeded the value of the goods.  Absolutely ridiculous.My options are to pay, or let the item be returned.  I have to add that I didn't buy this item off Amazon but when I told Parcelforce Coventry that I'd ordered high value items in the past with no problems, she said that I'd just been lucky not to have received a surcharge. Check where your items are coming from before you take the gamble.",2
1) Product reviews are mostly bots and they don't care2) They don't ever pack my stuff right. I've had to return 2 things in the past month alone3) If you leave an honest review about a company and the company doesn't like it they will have it removed.4) The way they treat their employees is laughably terrible,0
Need to look into your seller's duty... They are packing very poorly..... Bad usage,1
"I’m truly shocked by this cumulative rating! How have people had this many bad experiences with Amazon?I purchased regularly from Amazon and I’m a prime member. I’ve never had issues with returns that couldn’t be resolved with a phone call. I have received hundreds of excellent products through their site.I’m not thrilled that they have a monopoly in this industry, but their innovation has made our lives easier. It’s amazing they can deliver products on the same day you order. And with no fee! I’ve been able to order items that I’d never find in a local store.I don’t love that. The majority of their products are made in China. But that’s true for every brick and mortar store as well. It isn’t Amazon‘s fault that factories have been outsourced to another country.I love that anyone who wants to order from Whole Foods can do so through Amazon. I’ve done this once and it was helpful.The return process couldn’t be easier. The length of time allowed for returns around the Christmas holiday is wonderful. I do wish they’d allow a longer window for returns during the rest of the year. With such high sales volume it would likely create chaos though.I’m a fan even if I don’t agree with all of their practices. Thank you for making my daily life more manageable.",2
"At Amazon.com, I am a valued customer and receive respectful customer assistance and support. If I buy an item for $ 1, I can leave a review for this item and for the seller.After I bought two well-written, interesting books with an absolutely average cover (the books fell apart) from Amazon.de, I wanted to write a customer review. My rating was rejected on the grounds that I did not meet the minimum order value. The minimum order value is 50 + EURO in one year. I was shocked.Amazon.de customer assistance stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1

Four were left outside on the street - and subsequently stolen, the others were either cancelled after showing they were 2 stops away, the wrong product was sent or they just never showed up.  I've spent hours chasing them.  Paying Prime for next day delivery and lucky to get the parcels at all.  Needless to say I have now cancelled my subscription.  If you have an alternative company, use them.  Amazon is simply awful now!  Was told to raise a formal complaint, of which they didn't respond to.",0

Wish I could give less stars.Where to start apart from the fact this company are ablist(discriminate against disabled people)Won't help and when you ask to speak to a manager the advisor says the manager can do the same as me.When trying to return an item be sure you have bought a printer as you will have to print a label.Just don't buy the printer from Amazon as if it's faulty or the wrong item you won't be able to print the return label.Amazon are a joke and having call centres in foreign countries is not very helpful for someone who is deaf.If you want my opinion DONT USE AMAZON. THEY ARE TERRIBLE,0

Horrible delivery service they were good for awhile now its gotten worse even when it says out for delivery they don't even show up wasteing my whole day I think Jeff Bezos would be unhappy if he found out how these lazy people have turned his business into the worst ever,0
Amazon can be decent but when its average its average. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
Very bad service I ordered a mobile 21 may and the delivery time show me 23 may at 8:00 clock night time so I will wait all day but didn't receive anything and when I see on Amazon order status it's show me my package is damaged and return back so you can wait until the next update so I wait 2 days and then the status updates your package not delivered so we send you back you refund but still today I didn't receive refund I call customer service and they said please wait.next time I will never buy anything from Amazon...very bad bad bad and worse service.,0

Good for the most part but customer support can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon item or 3rd party seller,1
"Seeing Amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different types of decents. The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty decents or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of decents act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty decents. Also average if you have to return damaged decents, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded shipment so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a decent way for a company to work.",1
"Despite what they say, we have found returning stuff can be a real headache sometimes.  The process is a nonsense, and too long-winded.",1
I paid for an item and never received it. Amazon have not customer support option and only offer a return item option. Seller sent a pre scripted email and didn't bother to try to resolve the issue either. Amazon and the dodgy seller wiped their hands clean of the issue but happily kept my money. This is what i would consider an online scam. They only get away with it because their name is AMAZON.Update---------Amazon did eventually refund me for this item. The fault was with Royal Mail. They falsely claimed they delivered a parcel. I have a camera in front of my door. They lied.,1
"They censored my review when there was nothing inappropriate, or unfactual about an item I received. I ordered a box that had a mix of chinese sweet snacks. When I recieved it the vendor doubled certain flavors instead of giving a sample of all different flavors that were advertised. I left a review saying that I got 2 of one flavor instead of one of a different kind and was disappointed because I was looking for  a variety. I then recieved an email saying it couldn't be posted to amazon because it didnt follow their rules for leaving a review.",0
"Overall 5 Stars for Amazon…I love the convenience! But this packaging, I give three stars bc I question the waste from the shipping dept. And it’s happened before. Why do they package 2 very small items in a huge box with 4 ft of air pockets?  What a waste!",1

"Once I went through everything you have to go through to speak with a real person, I spent over 2 hours with a very nice amazon rep and a few others who helped me fix the many, many reasons I wasn't able to log in to my own account. Email updates, phone not even receiving the code sent via text to enter in order to be able to edit my info. (Couldn't update my phone number to log in because they kept insisting I verify my old phone number through a text sent to the number I no longer have!)  Or the password not accepted because it's in use (because it's mine) even though it's current. Yes, it was both an adventure and a huge undertaking requiring a team of experts to cut through all the engineered obstacles in place to keep someone out. (Unfortunately that someone today was me.)  She was very nice and they all stuck with it and helped me. Very nice people once you can reach them.  😊",1
Amazon is great for getting items but it is the deliveries that let them down. My Amazon driver always just leaves parcels in weird places and then in the app it won’t tell me where they are.,1
"Bought two pairs of shorts off an Amazon listed seller for holiday. Wore them once and found out zip was faulty. Tried to get refund but was told I was too late... So much for UK consumer law! Obviously doesn't apply to Amazon sellers. Same for second pair, bought from same seller. Washed once and they fell apart. Was told to go to seller who simply fobbed me off with being too late to request return or refund. Disgusted. Have deleted payments for Amazon. Never buying anything from them again. ",0

"Their delivery is terrible. You pay for Prime. You pay extra money for same day delivery. Wait up till 10:00 pm because they say it will deliver by then and then nothing. You track the package and it was 15 minutes away for 8 hours! You call customer service and they don’t care. Just another company that is about profits, not people. This happens all to often now. Amazon used to be good. Now it’s like a high end Wish.",0
Amazon is a staple for my Xmas shopping. They make any gift giving an easy task even for the pickiest people. I go to Amazon for everyone & their variety of products make shopping so easy.,2
Ordered the VCR /DVD combo for a great price. Was told shipping would be three days and it end up being five. Overall fine usage.,1

"I have never had anything negative to say about Amazon until this most recent interaction.  I purchased a bunk bed online at a great price.  Well apparently it was priced incorrectly and they cancelled my order with out notifying me.  First I don't think it's best practice for a business not to honor their prices they list but Amazon covered that in their terms and conditions... but what about notifying me, that is mentioned in their terms and conditions?!!!  I ordered it several days ago.  Amazon's terms and conditions state that they will notify you.  Well they violated their contract.  I had plans for the bunk bed.  Now my granddaughters old beds will be picked up on Wednesday and they will have no bed!  Thank you amazon for not holding up your end of the bargain.  A purchase is a contract and I held up my end, they did not. Also they are not refunding me for 7-10 days so I can't even go to a store and buy a bed until they give me the money to.  This is by far the worst interaction I have ever had with amazon.  And I have been an avid Amazon promoter and shopper for several years.  I will no longer provide them my business if they cannot operate with integrity and honor their end of the bargain.  Now my grandkids will be sleeping on the floor until I get my money! - Laura Sapp (269)491-1343",1
"Can't rate them lower since they started censorship. SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON !!!",0
I love shopping with Amazon. But there is one order driver who is unprofessional. He covers up ring camera. Stands to one side and when you try to talk to him. He won’t answer you. He wil post a letterbox parcel through letterbox. Then proceeds to ring the bell. If he has a large parcel he rings bell and knocks on door. He then walks away leaving parcel on doorstep.I’ve reported it but he’s still delivering parcels,1
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"My son was scammed and ripped off by Amazon!!! In general, I love Amazon and their products and services. But recently my son who is 18 opened an Amazon account and I wanted to teach him how to use and order from Amazon. Of course, we ordered goods like ""warm socks"". A few days later the courier delivered to the wrong address well, according to the photo of the 'proof of delivery' we were able to prove that it was not our address and house and of course it was refund done. A few weeks later we tried to order again exactly the same and guess what, the same again! This time he got a ""suspicious activity warning"" warning on my son's account and I tried to speak to customer service to confirm it wasn't his fault! A few months later he ordered 'headphones' which cost around £100 so guess what, same thing happened again!!! We were at home and no delivery only an email that you received the parcel...?! I called again and told the situation that we did not receive the shipment, I have security camera footage and can send proof that the courier was not at my place at the time. He said wait a few days and maybe the courier will deliver because sometimes the system mistakenly says delivered but they are still on their way. So we waited and called again after a few days. They advised to check the neighbors and come back in 48 hours. After a few days we called again... they said that will investigate and report back. After that call... a few days later my son's account was suspended due to an investigation. Tried to contact again and called like 10 more times trying to figure out what's going on here....asked for a photo of ""Proof of Delivery""....but (still haven't received it yet) ...so they shut down completely account and did not refund because their courier said the package was delivered safely to the location. today I spoke to an amazon ""manager"" who did not help me at all...couldn't give a ''Proof Of Delivery''...and no one can help because the courier said the item was delivered to the address and she can't change anything. The advice was from her... to contact the police...... So my son was left without money and without headphones. Therefore, dear future customers of Amazon....be careful...because if the courier steals from you...amazon will do nothing and you will be left without money and goods...and nothing to prove that it is not your fault. I am very disappointed with amazon!!! It's very scary that in the UK there are no laws that would protect the common citizens and such companies can steal from simple people's... it's very disappointing....",0
"Good goodss on sale! Any of those didn't show up as ""ordinary"" or ""disappointing"", and I've been satisfied with most of my orders.Still, I wrote a review about a goods to the seller, it has been two weeks, and it is not on the goods reviews. My opinion is important, and they just cant appreciate it? Whatever, keep your junk without.",1
One of the best internet companies. Always reliable but won't necessarily get the best bargain for your buck!,2
"They have employees coughing in our packages with Covid and putting harmful products in the things they sell. Then after giving you something not safe knowing kids will be using this they’ll cut off your ability to review the things and voice what’s going on within their company using a message saying “unusual reviewing activity” I’ve never left anything but good reviews wth is an unusual reviewing activity lol something sketchy is going on with them. Don’t expect to ever hear back from anyone and if you return a package you’re not getting your money back. Oh let me not forgot if you get amazon prime make sure one card is put in your account they’ve charged all 4 of my cards and 2 of my husbands for the same subscription everytime then act stupid when you bring it up well you just paid for this today well why is every card charged? Literally have about 4 subscriptions I should be paying a month instead I pay about 40 times a month for stupid little stuff but they are absolutely no help and the people you get on the computer are rude and unhelpful they are probably eating food and picking their a**hole while talking to you because they get absolutely nothing done. Stay away from amazon. The only reaponse I got to asking them to fix my account is I’m sending it to someone they are higher up they’ll have it fixed within 24 hours did that 5 days in a row now and their reaponse is first I just want to thank you for being with us since may 2010 like yea I regret it!! You guys are horrible they don’t want you to truthfully review anything so you’re probably getting garbage if you go off reviews they post their own reviews and block ours, they hack your cards, they don’t deliver anything on time! And absolutely no customer service they literally talk to you like your an enemy in a club so unprofessional and weird.",0
Let’s be real: there are a lot of positives. You can find pretty much anything you need on amazon materialist wise and shipping is generally very fast. The cons are that some of the companies through amazon reselling items can be sketchy and it can be concerning whether that item (lets say a beauty item) is legit manufactured by that company. The other issue is a little more philosophical I suppose but amazon has kind of become a monopoly and is putting a lot of smaller companies out of business.,1
extremely poor experience. missed a delivery as unable to change it without cancelling for the day and now waited in 36 hours and counting for the redelivery. they keep changing the time expected and I just know that come 10pm they will not have been and we move into another day. Rubbish,0
"I have had bad experiences with some retailers and will not use those  companies anymore due to their unpredictable and unreliable delivery times.  I much prefer Amazon because I have the Prime service, which means I can get some items later that day or the next. I even have their credit card and use on the site to earn points.  Such a convenient service during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",2

"This is more of a review on Amazon service!I took in a parcel from Amazon, for the property next door. It is a rental property and it turns out that the family moved out before Christmas so are not aware that I have this parcel.I took a photo of the label on the front and contacted Amazon to see if they could either trace the recipient so they can tell them to come and collect it, or at least arrange for one of their drivers to collect it and take it back to the depot.However on contacting Amazon I was told there was no way they can do this, and I can either keep the parcel or dispose of it!!Either of these options make me very uncomfortable, as it feels totally wrong!It does make me wonder how many goods are just kept or disposed of by people who are being neighbourly and basically doing Amazon’s job for them! I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here. What on earth would I do if they did that and I told them “ oh sorry, Amazon said I could just keep it “ I would be mortified.So my advice is, don’t take in anyone else’s parcels unless you know the neighbour well enough to know they haven’t moved house!",2
"Helpful, easy returns, great prices, good reviews for products, which really helps when shopping for an item.  I use Amazon more than any other shopping website",2
My Account got compromised as someone hacked  my account and I noticed it within a few hours since I was going to purchase a few items-I immediately contacted Amazon about the incident as money was withdrawn from my Amazon Gift Card and my Virtual card which I had on my account- which was gifted to me.-I have been calling everyday for the past 6 days and I get the same answer -we are investigating and will get back to you in 24hrs-but no response is ever received-so I suggest stay away from buying Amazon gift cards and using Virtual cards as there is no support from Amazon and the responsibility and risk is totally yours. Amazon is good as long as there are no complicated issue or Fraud-I even asked them if I could speak to the fraud Dept. but they said I could not. Not sure if they have a Fraud  deptt.,0
"Generally a decent website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally order is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal order), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong. My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.",1
"I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on goodss on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive interactions with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.",1

I told the driver he was an idiot not giving me time. I am 73. He asked was I from the address he was delivering to, then said Im not delivering. After explaining this to customer service, they said they require me to sign a form to say their drivers will be safe !!!!! So its never Amazons fault then ?",0

"For the past few days a promotion had been popping up on my account, ""Save $15 with your first sign in on the app"". I have a Prime membership and consistently place orders on Amazon but through my regular browser so I proceeded to download the app. After downloading the app I add an item to the cart that meets their requirement of $30. However, the $15 are not automatically deducted off the total. So I decide to reach out to customer service through the available chat option only to be given the runaround.My first complain is that I switch off from a representative to representative. If you do not respond back within a minute or god forbid 2. You will have a new representative that will need to read the complete conversation to catch up.Then a representative decided to focus on whether I received an email with the promotion? In which I respond, it doesn't seem to me that I need one when the promotion clearly states, ""the eligible customers should have received this offer directly from Amazon through the Amazon website OR by email. My favorite was when a representative told me I was not eligible because unbeknownst to me. I downloaded the app already in March 2018. Yet, I have several emails from Amazon throughout the summer with a similar promotion asking me to download the app.I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from Amazon. I had a more serious matter  resolved with Best Buy resolved through chat in less than 8 minutes. While, I had close to a 4 hour conversation through chat with more than a handful of Amazon representative only for my time to be wasted. A representative finally informed me a complaint will be placed after over 3 hours of me speaking with representatives and that I would hear back in 48 hours. 4 hours later over six representatives later, my matter was never resolved. My household spends thousands every year through Amazon. Just for them to not be able to honor a $15 promotion they themselves promoted to me on my account. I hardly ever use promo codes when shopping on Amazon but if they will be promoting a discount for downloads of their app they should honor it. Amazon will surely be losing much business from our end and I will be doing my research in other websites now instead of immediately going through Amazon.",0

"Amazon censors customer reviews by not accepting reviews about Amazon and by rejecting product reviews that include facts about the Amazon buying experience.More than a few times Amazon has shipped ""new"" items to me that were suspected of being used. This week I received two separate orders that were obviously not new. One item was sold by a third party Amazon seller so I was able to leave a review of the seller on the Amazon website. The second item was sold by Amazon and Amazon does not support reviews of Amazon on their website. When I wrote a review of the product that included details about the product being used, not new, Amazon rejected the review.Amazon collecting and posting reviews of its sellers while not allowing reviews of itself is questionable at best. It creates the illusion that Amazon doesn't have complaints like some of its sellers do.",0

"Ordered a Fire Stick on Black Friday. They charge me $119 a year for next day or 2nd day shipping, When I ordered it, they told me a week? I wasn't too happy but wanted the product. The day it was supposed to arrive they sent me an email pushing it back again. I called customer service and they told me it is their busy season and that's the issue. No solution other than an offer of a $10 credit on my next purchase. Of course the day it was supposed to arrive after being pushed back, another email extending delivery another week. What am I paying $119 a year for? I can get terrible service for free! Don't use Amazon!",0

"Amazon have the worst customer service I’ve ever known and that’s saying something after dealing with Sky who are beyond shocking. Anyway back to Amazon, their customer service is rude, lazy and incompetent. Their delivery drivers deliver parcels....just not to you. God knows where they end up. Contacted Amazon MANY MANY times over the last few months and I’ve been told they don’t compensate customers for mistakes, their policy is to take feedback on board and train the staff. Oh my goodness me, never heard anything so ridiculous as the same mistakes are made over and over again.

Amazon has a habit of overpricing, was looking for a graphics card to finish my computer - had no choice but to pay almost £200 more than retail value (item sold and dispatched by Amazon) I get it , these are hard to get at the moment but it's still a cheeky move! Especially when other smaller retailers stick to suggested pricing. On top of that their drivers think it's ok to leave parcels in the communal areas and don't bother to come upstairs. Amazon also don't like negative product/service reviews and refuse to publish them on their website. Amazon you have become a real stinker and I'm not going near you again. Cheers - awaiting my prime membership refund.",0

"The store needs a total overhaul, function is LOST in search and sort. The site CHANGES DEPARTMENTS when advancing to the next page of results, which also changes your results.

There was a time when that shipment date was fixed. Now it changes even in previously received mails. The only way to keep track of their promises is to make a screenshot. The most irritating things is that every time you write to complain about undelivered items and warn other users, amazon refuse your review. They even remind you stupidly that your review should focus on the item quality.  How are you supposed to do that without even receiving the item ?",1

"I have been a customer of Amazon since 2008. Ive always thought how great it was. They say you can buy anything if you change your mind or faulty then return it. We a few years ago they threatened to close my account as i returned a lot of items i told them that i thought that's what they pride themselves on plus if the items are faulty why should i be forced to keep them. On Sunday 21,02,21 they sent me an email to say that because i had recently sent many items back they were closing my account. I was appalled at this since the majority of items were face masks, i ordered lots some were not good quality for the money so i sent those back id bought over 24 in total. A high chair had missing items and an electric toothbrush had 2 pin plug so i sent it back along with the spare toothbrushes. I bought an echo as a gift my daughter said she didn't want it so i had to return it cat beds to choose i sent them back but kept the expensive ones. Anyway on the same day my Alexa device was deactivated by Amazon they had no right to do this as id bought it im 2018 from them.no one at amazlon can activate it i was told its been blocked because of the closing of my account but a person who's emaed me to say they wont reinstate my account said i can access it through my account that's been closed.whats haplennex to the respect that customers have Always been given im absolutely appalled at their action.

"I'm buying on Amazon from time to time. Once I bought birthday balloons. They were not cheap. However, one of the balls turned out to be a hole. The only way to get the refund was to send the balloons back, but the envelope was in the bin, so I did not have an address where to send it. And I also assume that sending them back will cost me more than balloons. I had to buy new balloons again, but in the store. Thus, I paid twice, and I felt that I was not protected in this case.",1
Reliable and fast,2
Great company and quick delivery. I will buy from them again for sure.,2
"I typically have fine usages with amazon, but my last few orders have been a sub-par usage. They're just such a big company that you feel like you get lost in the system. There is no ""one-on-one"" type feeling when you call them. You're just another number.",1

Used Amazon with work for years. Recently purchased Amazon Prime at home and can't fault it so far. Love being able to get Morrisons food delivery on my doorstep the next morning!,2
Been a prime user for about 3 years. Use to be really decent. Even use to get same day shipment. Now shipment’s are 2-4 days,1

"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1

I am literally on the phone every week with Amazon customer service because one thing or another didn't get delivered or it was delivered to the wrong place or it's being held at US post office service. Whenever I call weekly by the way I get the most ignorant clearly non-educated people answering the call who don't know how to do anything but say oh I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I swear to goodness if one more Amazon person says I'm sorry to me I am going to lose my cool! I ordered pillows in June they never arrived they sent me new pillows which said were delivered but when you looked at the tracking the carrier just picked them up and that was the end of the tracking. So of course I had to do all the work I have to cancel the order I have to reorder them at a more expensive price because it's now been 2 months in the price is gone up I swear to God I am so flipping sick of Amazon and they're terrible policies and the fact that they really don't give a crap about whether you get your stuff or not. The policies they have in place are just ridiculous people are stealing my stuff so I have to cancel my order and reorder it again and they're stealing my stuff by not delivering it to me so it's not like somebody stealing it off my mailbox no it's never getting delivered half the time honestly I would not join Amazon and I think I'm going to cancel my whole thing because I'm sick of it I'd rather go to stores and wait at least then I get what I want and I don't have people lying to me I cannot stand when people lie and I think that's how they train their customer service just lie to them just lie to them it'll be fine go ahead and lie and say you're sorry eventually they'll be worn down and they'll do whatever you want. You know it would be different if they actually needed individual customers I feel like but they don't so they don't give a crap,0

"Fraudulent Company,7/10 times do NOT deliver goods/items.Do not refund when requested.The SELLER VERIFICATION team is extremely inefficient,unprofessional,very very rude.Stay Away!",0
Love their service but they delivered wrong product this time . Hope they do something about this,2
So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years and when they say your package is arriving or it’s going to be delivered then that’s what it is. So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very ordinary business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,1
"Further to my last review, Amazon has made some amends so thank you.",1
A shop with very good assortment good prices both in the store and online very good quality in the products,2
If I could 0 I would Amazon has put a policy in place to refund money on the account after 30 days so basically they receive their item back  and they have the item in the warehouse and also had Ls your money for 30 days while you as a customer is paying interest on the purchase this is another level of taking advantage of costumer’s and holding costumers money hostage,0
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their support, their items and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer support representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
"June 30th I ordered a hands free earpiece optional headset, I signed up for prime in order to get it before the 4th of July weekend.  That's the pitch rite??So, it takes a week to get my 'order', I opened it and it's not what I ordered!  Decided to go ahead and try using it because I was desperate for a hands free device.  It says refurbished on the outside, as soon as I try it on, the band that goes around your head is miss-shapen, very awkward and immediately comes apart from the main body. I called to straighten this out with Amazon, through two service reps that want me to return and have their wrong item received back before I can get a credit to re-order the correct product... I say bullcrap I signedup for Prime for this shxt, wrong product, bad service,  no deal!   ....I swear this shxt is fucjed up!  3rd Special service rep says she'll send a UPS driver to my door in next morning to pick up my repackaged product and I'll have a refund credit within an hour of the driver picking it up, I can reorder and life will be grand!!  5 days later I'm still coming home to this package in the door!!  This crazy story goes ON!!  I was disconnected after explaining this situation to a CS REP cause idt  she wanted to deal with it.  Called back...nice foreign gentleman, apologies and kindness, expedited a refund before getting the package back!!  All other ppl I spoke to were like ""oh we can't do that""!  What in the HELL???  He was happy to help but these other clowns  were like running into a brick wall!!  I just said everything will be great if this all happens!! 🙏🙏  today is the 16th of July , I'll be shocked if I can order and use that credit to get the right item I ordered within two days of reordering!!! Two stars is being generous for what I've been through In this ordeal!",0

Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.,1
I think considering Amazon is a multi-billion pound company they should give you an average time when your parcel will be delivered instead of having to wait in from 8 o'clock in the morning till 9 at night for your parcel to get delivered they say they can leave it somewhere but what if you don't have anywhere to leave it as it will get stolen I think it is ridiculous and they need to look into this matter to give people around about time your parcel will be getting delivered instead of having to hang around all day especially on a Day Like This with the sun is shining you don't get many they seem to be up to date with everything else so why not delivery times,0
"I got board game that had not been packed in anyway, the postal label were just stciked stricktly to game package. Obviously when the game arrived to other side of the world it was all messed up. First customer service contact person got me the feeling that everything wilm be all easy and dandy and I will get full refund. Well now after month later, talking to 10 different customer service people, I thought that I got finally my money back through promotional code (because of company police) but instead of 32$ I was suppose to get I got 30 cent. I tried to contact them once again and they just replied ""you used it already"" and I didn't even make my order I was suppose to place in. So now I cancelled my prime and audible and will boycott this company. I will also start subreddit for baf experiences so everyone can share their stories. ",0
"I find it very hard to understand in relation to an organisation. As large as Amazon cannot deliver one basic item. This item has cost me over £1500 and like for the fact that they couldn’t deliver on two separate occasions and Me persistently doing chase calls to get it. Redelivered is absolutely outrageous if Amazon wish to advertise and put items on their webpage to do it, they intend to sell, and if they know that that item is going to be of some conceptive heavy and they need to facilitate that it shouldn’t be down to the customer to get through to the point whether they’re gonna get cancelled and then get a refund absolutely disgusting. I think Amazon need a seriously look at the logistic all operation because it doesn’t function doesn’t work on top of which I don’t think really at the end of the day that are doing the deliveries need to pay attention to the information that’s been sent. I sent information directly onto the Amazon website given specific instructions and they were not followed very basic. We had to do was open the back garden door. The garden door was left open and then leave it there  Quite simple, but clearly not simple enough very poor service. ",0

"Worst customer service. Amazon now uses sub-shipping companies such as dynamex who tends to misdeliver the item. Contacted Amazon to look into the lost item and asked for the refund. This was their response to a 13-year-old loyal prime member. Nesha | Customer ServiceUnfortunately we can't replace/refund this item. Per our conditions of use under section Risk of loss: ""All items purchased from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier."" (http://tiny/4g2wyvza/amazgphelpcustdispref)",0
"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 goodss that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 goods that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of goodss, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1
I am impressed with how quick they sent me my CD's,2
"I don’t understand how Amazon got so many one star reviews. I’ve never had a bad experience. Never never, and I’ve been shopping with them for a very long time and have spent a very large amount of money and every time my stuff didn’t show up I got my money back then my stuff would show up and I still get to keep my money. or it would show up and it would be open and they would let me keep the product and give me my money back. I mean their customer service is great. Most of their things on there a better quality definitely than Temu or SHEIN . Definitely way better service than TEMU. Not to mention both of those companies are terrible terrible when it comes to customer service and their games but they are cheaper than Amazon. And you can get some pretty cool stuff for cheaper. But you have to wait forever. It seems but anyways Amazon rocks and I love Amazon.",2
"While somethings are acceptable on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their order drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything ordinary they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1

"I ordered a Ninja air fryer on the 14/12. Today I was told Hermes had delivered it at 3.44 pm today. First they said it had been handed to the customer and then changed it to ‘left in a safe place’.

"I order many items for personal and business from Amazon.  Generally, the items from Amazon direct are delivered on time and work well.  However, in my recent experiences with refurbished computers and electronics I received several defective products from Amazon third party sellers.  The third party sellers did not respond for refunds or returns.  Amazon did NOT stand behind their A to Z Guarantee.  After several emails and phone calls to their customer service, it was a miserable experience. They misrepresented their return to me and never provided a refund.  I don't think the A to Z guarantee is real???   I learned my lesson, NOT to buy from anymore third party sellers, as Amazon won't warranty their products.",0
"My wife and I are dedicated Kindle fans and Amazon customers. They released the new line of Kindle's this week which made us both happy (it's the best e-reader out there and improving it even more is terrific) and a little frustrated. You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old. I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India. The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board. While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty.",2

"As a whole I have had a fine usage with Amazon, but that changed today when I called and Mezagreg (?) answered. I will take responsibility for halfway listening (working) to his question and answering him, but there is no excuse for chastising a customer for the way they talk. I  showed frustration for a situation that I'm dealing with and having an Amazon representative try to control me and the way I talk is crossing the line. He even laughed with amusement telling me to be professional (the customer). Then he hung up on me.  The next representative told me what he wrote explaining the call which was not the truth. I am sick of customer assistance representatives abusing the customers because they know they can hangup on us with the support of the company. How can a customer get help or ask a question if the people answering the phone has it out for us even before they answer. No care for the customer anymore.",1
Amazon has switched most of its shipping from UPS to USPS which has been terribly unreliable or extremely late in deliveries. Very disappointing for an Amazon Prime customer!!,1

UPS has matched all QR codes to the receipt, but Amazon says they have not received the products. $383.02 worth of my hard earned money. UPS advises to reach out to Amazon, Amazon claims to have not receive the items. My credit card company won’t refund the money, because Amazon claims they have not received the items.

"An Honest Review of Amazon I have been an Amazon customer for several years now, and I believe it's time to share an honest review of my experiences with the e-commerce giant. While Amazon offers numerous advantages and convenience, it also has its fair share of drawbacks that need to be acknowledged. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Vast Product Selection: One of Amazon's biggest strengths is its unparalleled product range. From electronics to clothing, home goods to books, you can find almost anything you need on their platform.2. Competitive Prices: Amazon's marketplace fosters competition among sellers, often resulting in competitive prices. You can often find great deals and discounts on various products.3. Convenience and Speed: Amazon's Prime membership offers fast and free shipping on eligible items, making it incredibly convenient for time-sensitive purchases. Additionally, their user-friendly interface and seamless checkout process enhance the overall shopping experience.4. Customer Reviews: The abundance of customer reviews provides valuable insights and helps make informed purchasing decisions. It's beneficial to hear others' experiences before making a purchase.Cons:1. Counterfeit Products: Due to the sheer number of sellers on Amazon, there is a risk of encountering counterfeit or low-quality items. While Amazon takes measures to combat this issue, it remains a concern for some buyers.2. Third-Party Seller Discrepancies: As Amazon allows third-party sellers, inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and shipping practices can occur. It's essential to research sellers and read reviews before making a purchase.3. Environmental Impact: The rapid growth of Amazon's operations has raised concerns about its environmental impact, such as packaging waste and carbon emissions from delivery vehicles. They have made some efforts to address these concerns, but there is still room for improvement.4. Worker Conditions: Over the years, there have been reports and controversies regarding the working conditions at Amazon's fulfillment centers. These issues highlight the need for better worker treatment and labor practices.Overall, Amazon remains a convenient and popular platform for online shopping, but it's important to approach it with awareness of its limitations. Being an informed shopper and understanding the potential drawbacks can help mitigate any negative experiences. Amazon's continuous improvements and addressing of these concerns would undoubtedly contribute to a better customer experience and make it an even more reliable platform in the future.",2

"The local Royal Mail sorting office would be half empty if it wasn't for Amazon's business. But no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list: there is a razor sharp focus in the search engine, but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent.  Sorry guys, but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset, if we ever had a title or author to start with.",1
"Unhelpful.  Customer services was unable to understand my problem with a seller.  The seller had missold a piece of furniture (a bed) as it was not the measurements stated.  As it was missold the seller should have dealt with the issue.  Amazon's response was that the seller was dealing with it as they had agreed I could post it back and would refund me when they received it.  If I had to post a missold bed back to the seller at my own expense and have the postage recorded it would cost me a fortune and I would not even know where to begin returning a bed by post!  They were not taking into account that it was missold and just kept telling me to return the bed.  Also, the customer service person referred to me by my last name without using Ms or Mrs, it felt very rude, and I corrected them but they didn't get why it was wrong.  Ultimately the issue was not resolved and I decided that the whole reason I liked amazon was because I trusted them to resolve issues.  I would be better off shopping directly with shops on line as I would have more rights and be able to deal with the issue more directly.  Amazon not only did not help but I have no way of directly contacting the seller as they only provide a no-response email when they send me any communication despite telling me in the email to call them.  I have decided to stop trying to get my money back through Amazon but I am taking the matter to Trading Standards.  In the meantime I have lost all trust in Amazon and will only now use them for small items that can be posted back and for Amazon Prime.  I do not trust them to deal with larger purchases.",0

"Prices are acceptable, and I've had acceptable interaction with customer support. Whenever I had an issue, they just refunded, no questions asked. Overall I'm happy with them.The problem is the purchasing interaction and scammers. The web UI can get very confusing, mixing new and used in the same page, sometimes a single listing is from a certain buyer, sometimes there are several, and so on. Can get lost easily.A big issue is with scams/fake reviews. Lots of listing are full of reviews for a completely different goods. Sometimes the same listing includes different goodss, and others the seller switched goodss and kept all reviews. Very hard to tell which goodss are acceptable or average based on that.",1

Amazon will not post a review that one star I ordered from a vendor through them and I guess my fish went around the world because they were in the mail for a week when the vendors guaranteed three day when I Did a review Amazon refused to post it because it was a one star review I don’t know what they’re up I was a good customer there need to reconsider did 4 orders a month.  I guess it’s back to brick and mortar,0

"Have been a prime member for years. Recently - the massive company that is Amazon, not only is charging me for membership (which is so I can enjoy free deliveries), but have now started charging for next day delivery and you now have to spend over £20.00 for same day delivery. Why are we paying for membership? I would like the Managing /Director of Amazon to read this!! Please make sure he gets this message. You had my my loyalty for years. Please do not trample it!I never though Amazon would have become so underhanded to try these tactics.I also spoke with an agent today who was the most rude, obnoxious, customer service agent I have ever come across. She was not listening to me, she was over talking me, she was condescending, she did not try to help, she tried to frighten me by saying that my account had been compromised as I had 42 different accounts? If this is the case then Amazon has let fraudulent activity take place without my knowledge.Call was made today on 14/10/2023 from the UK - the agent I spoke with was named Samantha.Disgusting behaviors from Amazon and it's associates!!!!!Please let me know what you intend to do about the above two issues!!!!",0

"Since Amazon has gone to its own shipping, the shipping has become unreliable. I recently ordered three cases of copy paper at the same time, same order--one came one day, a second came the next, and the third never came and Amazon told me it had been returned. How can three packages, ordered at one time, each find a different path (or not) to the purchaser? With other order, packages have been dropped off at neighbor's houses and then shown on the Amazon website as being 'delivered'. Clearly Amazon should not be in the shipping business. And for the privilege of this Amazon ""support"" the company has increased its membership fees substantially. I am frankly looking at alternate suppliers.",1

Unfortunatley I requested a refund for a item bought on a Amazon card which I had cancelled. So we reinvented the wheel again, Amazon card company would not pass me through there security check, so back to Amazon, who said they would put me through to the Amazon card company, So basically you are stuffed in a loop now one will give you a phone number or arrange for someone to call you back. So steer clear of this card for your own health and wallet. if you want my contact details I am not shy I dont know the rules but its stourbridge kev on facebook.",0
In past 3+ years I’ve had only one poor shopping experience. I average ordering 3-6 items each month and ship to 6 addresses since we RV across USA.

Now with Prime my orders are 2 weekdays away to include Saturday and Sunday deliveries.,2

The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer assistance rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer assistance, is that if you ask a question about a goods because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer assistance reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
What’s the point of paying for Prime and being told you will get next day delivery and you don’t! This has been happening to us for a while now. In future we will shop elsewhere!,0
"Generally a decent website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally shipment is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal shipment), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong. My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.",1
"It has become very obvious that Amazon intentionally delays their free shipping, probably so people upgrade shipping methods and pay more.  I just recently ordered something they have in stock sold from amazon, and was told it would ship from amazon a week(7days) later. What is up with that? Two days later I cancelled my amazon order, ordered from somewhere else(shipped same day), and still got my package delivered 3 days before amazon was to even ship it! You can read all about this on amazons own forum, hundreds of people wondering WHY amazon has become so slow past couple years.  All i can say is im not going to wait if better support is out there for basically same price, people will catch on, and go somewhere else, naturally.",1
It very useful for old age guys & candicap,2
The packaging arrives open. Some products and never delivered and no refund given. The delivery people lie about delivery and this dishonestly continues. Amazon on purpose does not approve such reviews or deletes them abd keeps only good reviews on their website. Dishonestly at its best.,0
Job to worker ,2

"I’ve bought from Amazon for the last time!!! They would not help me at all after I was scammed by a third party seller, Tek Star. Told me I didn’t qualify for their A to Z guarantee but couldn’t tell me why.  Bought a pc from tek star, a third party seller on their site.  When I received the pc it wasn’t built completely,  connections not made on the inside and couldn’t connect my cords from the outside because the video card was hanging lop sided.  Sent the pc back the same day.  Total cost was 914 and some change.  Tek Star is charging me 776.00 restocking fee and only refunded 138.00.  They are saying I sent back a different item than they sent me.  Amazon is refusing to help me and got nothing but the run around from 3 of their employees during a 3 day span.  Amazon told me I didn’t qualify for their A to Z guarantee and wouldn’t tell me why.  They gave me an email address to send me issue to, LOL and my email came back undeliverable.  Be aware!!!  Scamming third party seller and Amazon will leave you hanging.  I’ve since disputed the charge w my cc  company.",0

One part of my order would have been delivered Wed, and the other part on Thur, but I picked the fewer deliveries option which showed everything would be delivered on Fri.  Tracking still shows as delivering by 8 pm, but UPS doesn't even have the tracking number in the system.  Will not be making that mistake again!  From now on everything can be delivered individually!!",0
"Excellent is not what I would share about any company. But Amazon has been exceptional in so many regards as to shipping on time, the amount of choices, desired product lines. Amazon could improve on their Prime in MY opinion. Give a bit more leeway in the choice of movies presented. I mean, there are so many films that should be on Amazon Prime that are not. Any movies over Ten Years Old should be free in MY opinion. I mean, seriously, what's the big deal here? So many great flicks from awhile ago and still you want to be paid for them. You are already receiving 100 dollars a year for Prime. And I might add, you are a HUGE company with substantial profit.",2
An incredible retailer. On time. Reliable. Encyclopedic choice. Affordable. ,2
Terrible quality control and delivery service. And that's not even considering the human rights issues.,0
Everything From Price to deliveryp to communication to customer service sucks at Amazon,0
Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1
Highly recommend,2
Received an unsealed and faulty product.I already sent many pictures to Amazon and they don't care. All the replies are the same saying they can't do anything.,0
Hard to find stuff even with their search engine. You ask for a specific description and they serve up everything else as well. Very hard to navigate through hundreds of pages finding that one item you wanted to find with the search key.,1
Ever since they decided my reviews are somehow in violation of their policy. Seriously I'm an old hippie and I didn't break there stupid rules.  Since then my service has sucked. It's very rarely I get a product any where near the time promised sometimes 2 months ago I canceled a few orders. They promised delivery by a certain time then 2 days goes by and all of a sudden you aren't getting anything for 2  weeks or more. Once they steal your ability to review a product is as if no one cares at all if your happy anymore. I'm an old lady that never profited off my reviews just trying to help others with my experiences. I'm no longer going to Amazon first.  I have way more options than I originally thought and I'm getting products quicker and in better shape as well. I am most likely going to cancel. Feeling like a second class citizen with no voting rights.,0

"Many people to talk to, but no one who can really help your issue. They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a ordinary mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",1

Worst usage on online shopping ever!! Amazon can’t keep track on what their sellers mail to their buyers. I ordered the MPow headphones (red color) and instead received a black/neon green pair of headphones made by Yuanguo. I tried to get my money back and instead their costumer supports negotiated with me to resend a replacement and Amazon costumer supports guaranteed that this time I would receive what I bought. The replacement arrived and now I’m stuck with 4 pairs on earbuds I never ordered. I’m very upset and would like to be sent the goods that I actually ordered. I will never buy anything with amazon again. Amazon needs to wake up for that and keep a better track on what’s being send by the sellers.,1

Option for order i use Amazon on a regular basis I like them except they don't give you an option on who you want to to ship your items it's simple you pick your shipping company at check out 3rd time I've recommend this thanks,1
A waste of money i got a membership and i never used it and wanted to cancel because When i did finally place a prime order the package was delivered a week later why am i paying $59 for a membership and you deliver my order as if im not then they tell me i can get a partial refund because i placed an order already. Not to mention what i order was kids multivitamin and they were expired that’s disrespectful this is for a child and you send it expired and the item was sold and shipped by amazon so they have no excuse about another merchant making a mistake. Then hungup in my face when i was nothing but cordial the superviser said i have other customers and hungup. Dont order from them just go to the store on your own!!!,0
I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer assistance levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the assistance on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
My most recent experience purchase no issue delivery on time. Discription size did not match on delivery posted message to seller no response left it a while WILL NOW CONTACT AMAZON SOON AS I GET CHANCE. I have left me with a sour experience as when orders are from Amazon directly there are no issues but 3rd party not so much will still shop with Amazon with a view to avoid 3rd party if possible.,2
"What a complete shower. A useless company.Ordered goods, got emailed they had been delivered, but hey, they were not there. Tried to contact Amazon to resolve the issue. The phone lines were not working and online chat required the app which, for some reason, did not recognise the password I use to sign in.So now I am left with no goods and no means to rectify the issue.Mr Bezos, stop taking Star Trek actors Into sub orbit space flight and instead spend the money on your company infrastructure. This evening I have no goods, no means to contact anyone and your company have wasted hours of my time. My time and money may not be significant to you , but it is to me.

Was talked in circles by the customer service representative eventually the problem was solved not before I almost threw my phone out of sheer frustration dealing with the rep. Once the problem was solved I was then contacted again two minutes later asking what my problem was and how could they help. Upon informing them that my problem had already been fixed the new rep continued to ask my account details and what I needed fixed. No one listens, they are condescending and waste your time.",0

"AMAZON, VERY POSSIBLY THE WORST BIG COMPANY ON THE PLANET WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER CARE,,, IT SHOULD BE, ""CUSTOMER (WE DO NOT) CARE""!Now, I have no problem with saying that parts of the issues stem from my somewhat limited computer skills and my eventual loss of patience. The loss of patience however, was exacerbated by the Amazon System and the people I had eventually encountered.The System: I believe Amazon is one of the biggest companies on the planet and deals with such large volume of commerce giving them EXTREME POWER OVER SOCIETY AS A WHOLE,,, CONTROL OVER SELECT GROUPS,,, AND AS FAR AS THE INDIVIDUAL GOES... GREASE FOR THE GEARS! Amazon (and other huge companies highly advanced in technology) want to eliminate the ""Human Factor"" from their companies. They want ALL COMMUNICATIONS to be done with bots/A.I. on their end of the transactions... keep taking money from people to continue their automation and computerization. THEN, AS WAS WITH ME, the System failed. A $30 golf club arrives in bent box, broken in half. Needed to ask a question, (may have been somewhat or partially answered in their jumble of ""prepared answers"" if not in the first 50 or so maybe in the second group of 50 or so or 3rd group,,,). I struggled a bit but found a link to live chat. WHERE IT SEEMS MOST SITES YOU GO TO, YOU GET BOMBARDED WITH POP UP ADS,,, AND MOST JUMP RIGHT OUT WITH A, ""LET'S CHAT NOW, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH TODAY"", I had to search around and when I got to the page, I started with a question, it said somethinglike,  ""chat has been started , you are #1 in queue"". About 20 minutes later, I did what they wanted, I ENDED THE CHAT, WITHOUT EVER GETTING ANY REPLY. So next is the attempt to call. Forget it. Not after West Coast work hours, unless you do not mind talking with some whoever, from wherever on the other side of the planet. I mind. Conversation with foreign dialect/accents is tough enough then add the stress brought about by personal and financial information in a world loaded with scammers and con artists. After running into a couple of walls with offshore AND NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING YOU ANY HELP WITH CONTACTING A U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMPANY. EVEN GETTING TO SPEAK WITH A SUPERVISOR IS A BATTLE WITH SOME.SO,,, I call the U.S. Corporate phone #. WORTHLESS! IF AMAZON IS LOOKING WHERE TO SAVE SOME WASTED MONEY,,, ELIMINATE THE ""CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER"", ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS. HEARTLESS. SOULLESS, UNCOMPASSIONATE GROUP THAT DO VERY LITTLE TOWARD HELPING (ME ANYWAY),,, AND THEY LIE! CHECK Y'ALLS RECORDINGS! The U.S. CUSTOMER SUPPORT PHONE #, basically 5 prompts. 1- customer service- gives recorded instructions to GO ONLINE. 2- instructions. 3- instructions. 4- instructions. Prompt #5- THE LIVE PEOPLE THAT DIRECT YOU TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE,,, THEY ARE JUST THE CALL CENTER,,, CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE NUMBER I CALLED THAT EVENTUALLY RETURNS TO THEM!WHEN YOU START GETTING LOUD BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT LISTENING WHEN YOU TELL THEM THAT DOING WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO DIDN'T WORK AND ASK ""NOW WHAT?"",,, THEY THEN HANG UP ON YOU. AFTER TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT THEY EITHER AREN'T LISTENING OR DON'T UNDERSTAND, THEY HANG UP ON YOU. BETWEEN THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND THE LIVE AGENTS IN THE CALL CENTER IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON, I CONTINUED TO CALL JUST TO GET A SCRIPT READ TO ME SAYING THEY HAVE GIVEN ME ALL THE HELP AND GUIDEANCE AVAILABLE AT THEIR LEVEL AND THEN HANG UP ON ME... WOULD NOT TELL ME WHAT TO DO WHEN WHAT THEY HAVE TOLD ME TO DO DOESN'T WORK.It concludes with a final attempt at 1 of many AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE #s. A guy in India that said he was a supervisor with the ""escalation team"", highest level you can get by phone he said, but I had spent literally HOURS dealing with the Devil, and it boils down to AMAZON UPPER LEVEL COULD CARE LESS WHAT HAPPENS UNDER THEIR FEET AS LONG AS THEY ARE CONTINUALLY BLINDED BY THE MONEY.",0

"I ordered two chairs on Amazon and used my Amazon credit card. When I posted a review about the poor quality the chairs were and how poorly Amazon’s customer service behaved, they refused to post my review. They’ve posted every other review that I’ve made whether it was favorable or unfavorable about the item. However when it was unfavorable to them, they refuse to post it. Be very careful with Amazon and their credit card. With any other credit card you can dispute a charge but with Amazon credit card they won’t even answer the phone. The chairs were of poor quality and very difficult to put together. I requested the seller replace only one of the chairs because that was the only one that was broken upon delivery. They responded immediately that they would make it right and then they ignored my next three requests. So I tried to deal with Amazon directly and submitted a dispute and they totally blew me off. They said they get back with me in a week and I never heard from them. I placed another dispute and same process. So then I tried through the Amazon credit card and I couldn’t even get a customer service rep on the phone. And there’s no way to dispute a charge online. I will certainly never use my Amazon credit card again. While Amazon has pretty much everything you could want, they can’t behave as though you don’t matter at all.",0
"This company does not offer you prices that are better.  The quality of merchandise is very bad.  I had purchased for 150.00 a cage and it came broken, purchase 5 pairs of pants said to be made in the USA but were actually from China, lets just say the sides were all ripped within a few minutes of wear.. their ebooks (which they guarantee 7 day return) can actually be taken from you for no reason and they do not give you the money you purchased.  Their reason is that you are not actually the owner but just renting them.. You can not read them on any item other than something they sell so if you cancel your amazon then you loose everything you have purchased (e-books).  There are better places to make purchases that don't fatten their pocket book and cost you money, items that will be better.. I spent over 35000.00 on this company over the years and am now finding this out as well.  Every item I purchased were not American made (or even better quality) but were made from China.  Every single E-book I have had to fight to get back and the kindle fire that I purchased worked only for 7 months.. I had to download the application to read them on the computer which is a pain. This company does not look out for their customers just their pocket books.  Once again do not use this company, there are way better ones that make and sell better quality items.",0
Great assortments and great customer service.I had a problem with a delivery and they solved this very well.,2
"I cannot count how many times they've offered next day order and every time I've ordered within the time frame and with a purchase amount to meet the ""requirements"" and not once has any of it been delivered next day. Not once. Do not fall for it. And it appears some of their drivers are either illiterate or just lazy or both. I order all the time from Amazon because it is convenient but Temu offers much better deals and even though the shipping takes longer, they don't lie about that and you get a credit if it's late.",1
"I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated shipment time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.",1
"My man besos sent me a 18 inch vibrating tentacle, kinda sus I try it and it then inserted some liquid in me, I fall to the truck I died and respawn in Western Africa and lost all my endgame gear I’m disgusted I have to fight the last boss again ffs will not shop here again pls like",1
best delivering compony in the world you deliver my day in a good way and bring the stuff we get in a couple of days like a breeze I love amazon,2
"For two years I have had nothing but great usage with Amazon, until two months ago when I received notice that I had ordered ( unknown to me) a $100 reload of a gift card, then received a notice that I would be receiving two $50 play stations I ordered (unknown to me). I tried dealing with the customer support reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer support rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really? I will miss the convenience of ordering online but not the nightmare of trying to deal with customer support that can't fix a problem or don't care enough to try.",1
Lately whenever I have placed order with Amazon fresh the people packing the orders have been very sloppy. Anything from flattened bread to wrong items in bag. The other day they totally sent me someone else order. Granted Amazon does give refunds or replacement items and thats decent. So why can't the people packing the orders get it right. This is time consuming and irritating for the customer.,1
"They claim to have shipping preference options that are not available. I often choose ""1 day shipping"" only to find out that my order is arriving in 5 days. This is not a pandemic issue, as this has happened before.  Customer service will claim that nothing is wrong, and that it never said 1 day shipping, but believe me, I can read and I know what it said when I ordered. I don't even care if it's delayed, just don't pretend I didn't choose 1 day shipping - it's insulting to be gaslighted like that. Scummy company, and when the pandemic is over I will likely cancel prime and go back to shopping local where people are honest.",0
Heartless corporation that doesn't care about customers.They should change their mission and vision statements as they fail to deliver on this,0

fine items not happy they charge you for p&P,1
I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.,2
Slow order! Good item!,1
"No one is perfect but Amazon has always fixed any issue I have with them.  From refunds to replacements to Prime, this company is superb!  Trustpilot needs some more good reviews too when people are satisfied so here is one for Amazon!",2
Hard to find stuff even with their search engine. You ask for a specific description and they serve up everything else as well. Very hard to navigate through hundreds of pages finding that one item you wanted to find with the search key.,1
"I've ordered from Amazon countless times, most of the time I do get the packages. Sadly now and then they fail to deliver the items, and just recently they've failed once again to deliver.To say that it's annoying is an understatement. Clearly they really need to improve on this. 3 stars because they have previously managed to deliver items, but also failed to deliver items.",1

Have bought car diagnostic device. Not enough they send me wrong one it didn't do anything to my car i had to pay to return it.,0
"WHATEVER you do, DON'T accept an invitation to upgrade your personal Amazon account to business!  It's a scam so that you lose your video library and can never use it again!!!  No entertainment and they don't tell you when they make the offer!  I have spent 3 days on customer service calls and the answer is ""You can't fall back, you can't have your library, you are screwed.""  BEWARE!  Great for personal accounts, don't EVER think of becoming business attached.",0
"Hands down THE best customer service I've experienced online. I'm in Denmark and have been buying goods from the German Amazon for about a decade now.I've just been given my latest refund, which was for an awful Logitech MX Keys keyboard which luckily had one of its keys fall off after about 18 months, meaning I was still under warranty. I hoped to then be able to sell the brand-new replacement for a decent amount and buy a better keyboard, but Amazon just offered a full refund, which I happily accepted.I've had returns on close to ten orders, some of which have been swiftly closed with ""refund issued, no need to return the item,"" the others returned with a prepaid parcel slip that just needs to be printed and stuck on the box, and once they've received the item back, a refund has been issued.Once I bought twelve bottles of baby oil (enough to get free shipping), and it was delivered damaged with three bottles having escaped through a hole. I called the local carrier and was put in queue as number 90-something. While waiting I checked the Amazon website and discovered the option to have Amazon call you up. I activated it and was immediately called on my phone by an employee who promptly refunded me money for the three missing bottles, no questions asked. The local carrier called me back two hours later.This last refund was set in motion by the friendliest German supporter who laughed with me at my broken German and did his best to follow my better English.If there's one negative, it's that the search function on their own website is basically useless, so I have to use Google with ""site:amazon.de"" added to the query instead.I see many negative reviews based on having been fooled by refund scammers, fake websites, or forgetting your password and blaming Amazon, hating on Bezos (which I agree with), or some other random own-fault issue.I've spent at least 10k € over a decade and NEVER had a bad experience with them.People, if someone randomly calls you up and say they're from Amazon (or any other business), hang up the phone and block that number.

"+can buy items you can't buy locally+if you have a prime membership prime video is ok'ish and sometimes acceptable.-prices usually 2x to 10x, and sometimes even 100x the going retail value-Defective goodss other people have returned are resold as new while still defective-Products that are only supposed to only be sold sealed and sterile are resold open and unsterile after people have returned them.-Amazon sometimes prevents critical reviews such as when I bought a Amazon's Choice dash cam and wished to make a mixed review (it was super inexpensive but also had flaws like the image being flipped so it looked like you were driving in England instead of america.) but when trying to review i get the message:""Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this goods. Due to this activity, we have limited this goods to verified purchase reviews.""despite it being a verified purchase of mine",1
They’re always reliable for sure the only times I had any troubles with them was the delivery by Amazon which for whatever reason lost a package of mine. Other than that I’ve never had a problem,2
"Find alot of items overpriced, claim to give you free order if you are an amazon prime member but actually it comes in the price of items. Will block you from reviewing their items without an explanation. Given 3 stars as they do deliver next day or when promised. some items can be awkward to return if not up to satisfaction.",1

"Love them BUT the *price fixing* has to stop. One day celcius is 12 bucks for 12 pack. Another day it's 22 for the same one a couple days later. Black Friday and cyber Monday were both scams bcuz I seen the same stuff at same price days prior and after but they advertised 20 to 80 percent off those days and it was not more than 5 percent in all reality. *Deceptive, false advertising*The *fake reviews* have to stop. I always have to sift through and find real pictures of the item that ends up looking like it's from Alibaba or some knock off company. Those are low standards to follow!",1
"Delayed order , Classic Amazon smh...",1
"Amazon have started charging £25 for some single items to be delivered. I have been shopping with Amazon for years, buying random bits but also buying essential things again and again. I went on today to order 3 things I buy nearly every month for the past 4 years, I got to the check out and it said delivery charges would be £75 - with the items not being delivered for over a week. I got in touch with Amazon Rep, and they simply said some sellers can charge anything they like for delivery costs! I mean a delivery charge of £25 for one item that costs just over £2? Really? I'm finished completely with Amazon - not that they'll care I'm guessing.",0
"I bought a Jawbone activity tracker through Amazon as it is a great site and I buy a lot of stuff on it. However, when the product failed the manufacturer failed to honour the warranty because the product wasn't in fact sold by Amazon but by a third party supplier through Amazon. I had assumed buying from Amazon would have given me some protection but it doesn't so be very careful, suppliers might not honour warranties if you buy through Amazon.",0
"bought a tiny home for over 10k and was scammed by seller, they sent a computer mouse with tracking number and would not refund saying the package was delivered. they would not help even though its usps tracking number confirming its 3oz package and they don't deliver over 70 lbs. they refused to refund stating i had to return the item.",0
Excellent service love them Always going to use them,2
Been a bit delay recently but guess just near the Christmas.,1
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a shipment, they take away the packaging from their last shipment and use it again.",1
"Order item 7th October and was told it would be delivered by 14th October.  After wasting 3 days waiting for this parcel, I was told by the message bot to wait until 19th and contact again. Do they not realise people and  life and work.",1
"As a website it is acceptable. But if you're a sellers you will have a lot, I mean A LOT of problems, and you will surely need to consider that with a support (that answers only via email per 1 business day+ not on all questions you have. So you will repeat'n'repeat it forever, until you already will post something.) Very hard to understand how the whole tables , codes, etc work, because you can find it on some japan forums, but not on the official site.",1
I like the convenience of it but my deliveries are constantly being delayed.,1
"my doctor who poster with all the doctors signed ,my figure of Rey and others show how much they value their customers ",1
Love the interface. Love the categories and wide range of items.,1
Wish I could give less stars.Where to start apart from the fact this company are ablist(discriminate against disabled people)Won't help and when you ask to speak to a manager the advisor says the manager can do the same as me.When trying to return an item be sure you have bought a printer as you will have to print a label.Just don't buy the printer from Amazon as if it's faulty or the wrong item you won't be able to print the return label.Amazon are a joke and having call centres in foreign countries is not very helpful for someone who is deaf.If you want my opinion DONT USE AMAZON. THEY ARE TERRIBLE,0
Usually like their support but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1
"Whilst Amazon seem to deliver books ok, they failed to deliver a bottle of wine, their customer service website is dire and keeps taking you round in complete circles, I have now cancelled the order but there was no opportunity to speak to anyone and when on screen they said they were phoning me that was a complete lie, the phone never rang despite several attempts, Their customer service is just an utter waste of  space",0
"Since Amazon has gone to its own shipping, the shipping has become unreliable. I recently ordered three cases of copy paper at the same time, same order--one came one day, a second came the next, and the third never came and Amazon told me it had been returned. How can three packages, ordered at one time, each find a different path (or not) to the purchaser? With other order, packages have been dropped off at neighbor's houses and then shown on the Amazon website as being 'delivered'. Clearly Amazon should not be in the shipping business. And for the privilege of this Amazon ""assistance"" the company has increased its membership fees substantially. I am frankly looking at alternate suppliers.",1
"I was happy until they switched over to this Amazon Logistics bull crap with 3rd party carries instead of using USPS. Gifts I ordered for shipment to family in a different state was left on side apartment door vs. in the lobby. Did not ring my mother's apartment to let her know they were there other times. Yesterday I was expecting a package, it shows delivered and I was fed some excuse by the customer assistance rep that some ""new drivers"" may be scanning packages of delivered before they are. While this may be a chance due to the holiday season, I am giving them today for the package to show. If it does not, I will be asking for a refund or for the goods to be re-sent.",1

"Totally different way of doing things from the selling, after sales, refunds and delivery - spot on fast and very professional. I must have dealt with them at least 30 times and every time delivery on time and 1 time i changed my mind on a purchase and the refund was back in my bank before i got home from the post office. If all delivery companies could take a page out of their book",2

"Always waste more than an hour to have simple questions answered... We could ignore the fact that their English is not the best if they were actually helpful, but besides not being able to understand what you write, what they write is also not really clear.Was forced to keep on chatting with someone when I specifically requested to have the chat transferred to someone else I was told:- there is no such option (when they constantly transfer me around from person to person when they can't answer questions);- and shortly after I was also told ""If you confirm the issue we can transfer to relevant team"" - what kind of treatment is this?If I no longer want to have this person wasting my time, why am I being forced to speak with this person? Constantly kept on asking this person to either transfer or end the chat - and they just kept on refusing and taking the longest time to even reply.Every single time I contact them they are always inattentive (probably working on multiple cases at once), slow to react, & not knowledgeable about what they are saying. Huge waste of time",0

"I returned an item that was sold as new although it was used and amazon told me to return it and buy a new one. The only other such item was a lot more expensive, so they wrote me an email promising to cover price difference and import duties.Once I received the new item and contacted them for refund, they went back on what i have in writing and now refuse to uphold their end of the bargain. Desplicable behavior from a company that used to pride itself of their customer service.I spent almost an hour on the phone and nothing. Will not buy again.",0

"Amazon has been slipping for a while. Their shipping has been getting longer and longer. They will tell you at check out when the item(s) will be delivered and the item(s) arrive a week later.

One day, about 4 years ago, I orderd an item from Amazon and it actually arrived the same day!

They always throw a few pounds sweetener or a free month of Prime membership. Occasionally I get to keep the wrong item I received - they refund it but ask me to NOT send it back. When their pick up courier was consistently failing to arrive, they offered a full refund for sending the parcel myself via whatever courier I want.",1

My favorite membership is prime because so much is included with it. I purchase a lot through prime so it’s a great and convenient way to get products. Once I had an issue with not receiving a purchase and I had a 15 second chat with a bot that resent it out immediately with no further hassles. My only issue is Jeff Bezos. NO ONE needs that amount of money. You are literally hoarding resources that are keeping other people from living and thriving. It’s irresponsible and disgusting.,2

Shocking!When I talked to an operative this evening, it turns out that you have to Turn Off, Voice Purchase, found in Settings on your Alexa App.I pointed out that this should be made clear to people using the Alexa service. At the point when you say NO, you do not want to subscribe, that should be your word, NO! Just because they have your bank details, does not give them any more rights to take your money, to which they are not entitled. This is an unlawful practice, one which would not stand up in court.

"My review relates to author's whose books are listed on there.  I would not buy anything from them at this stage, even if they paid me to do so.  When the company receive a DMCA, staff member 'Chad' will claim that he's unable to read, despite working in a legal department.  He will insist that you re-send the DMCA several times before it is accepted.  It is often better to leave Amazon as a last resort, email all other contacts first, because they normally resolve the issue while Amazon are still claiming that they can't find your address, or some other detail, on the DMCA in front of them.  Unfortunately, you will probably have to deal with Amazon, because they host a large number of the illegal download sites.  As regards illegal book download sites, you will notice that any inaccuracies stated on Amazon are copied onto the illegal download sites. As regards inaccuracies stated on Amazon; edits to one Amazon site will not carry over onto the other sites, you have to edit each individually.  They will not delete your books, even if they are out of print, or were never available for sale.  They allow book sellers to make any changes they wish, but deny that right to the copyright owner.  This is because they derive a monthly income from book sellers and they want you to pay that fee as well, so although there is an 'author central' for UK, France, Germany, Japan and America, they will often ignore your edits, complete them incorrectly, or claim that you wish to edit something they are not able to edit.  I would note that not all the Amazon sites are completely incompetent and I will do separate reviews for those, having now dealt with all of them.    The American site are rude and unwilling, they take an absolute age to make the simplest of edits and willfully admit that they have people registered as the 'copyright owner', or 'publisher' of work not owned by the registrant - when asked to elaborate or provide details, they will refuse to do so, thereby willingly and knowingly supporting copyright and royalty theft.  'Mike Hammer' of Amazon (US) will eventually send you a supervisory email, after you've received multiple emails from the 'team' about unrelated issues, suggesting that they do not understand your edit, or their job.  His email will inform you that the correct way to edit Amazon US is to fill out the 'Report a Problem' form on each page, as members of the public do and then he will inform you that you could join 'seller central' (paid service), where you will be able to edit whatever you want - thereby giving an author less rights to their own work than; publishers, thieves, the public, book sellers and of course; Amazon.  He will then abruptly inform you that 'this is Amazon's final response to this issue', like the sociopathic, pumped up incompetent he is and as such displaying his unfounded arrogance, as such people love to do, because it gives them a temporary feeling of unachieved superiority, which is much quicker than working for that stuff. Not only that, apparently Amazon pay minimal wage and low taxes, so there is little wonder that they are a billion dollar company, but only when there is no more art and no service amenities and all workers are living off food stamps will society realize that Amazon may be cheap, but its' company practice is not what the world needs and by then it will be too late, so for your own purposes;Only send them a DMCA when you have exhausted all other options.  Unless it is of huge importance, don't even bother contacting the American site regarding edits to their listings, if their incompetence doesn't get you, their attitude problem will.If your book has been listed incorrectly, you would be best advised to edit it on other sites, so that your other listings are correct.  Other book selling sites are only too happy to hear from an author and make appropriate edits, because good listings sell books and that is their business.  Don't waste too much time on Amazon and don't pay them any money, unless you really have to/want to.I would further note, unlike other companies listed on this site, there is no option to send your review to the company you are praising/complaining about.  Now, officially that will be because they are 'too busy', but given their standard of service, that is obviously incorrect.  The actual reason is that they have no interest whatsoever in what any of you think; good or bad.  They just want your money.",0

I would not recommend amazon to anyone. I have noticed multiple times they have charged me more than what my order says I will be charged and every time I bring it up they either tell me they didn't make any charges or check with my bank. This time she tried to tell me they didn't take any money so I asked if I could send screenshots because she said the transaction IDs were incorrect I emailed the screenshots to her. Then she came back with that money is just on hold not taken out to call my bank. When your sneaking money from people your scamming them period! Even if it's a dollar here or there.,0

Amazon has always replaced these quickly and with no fuss whatsoever.  However, do be aware that your clippings and notes are lost in the process. Generally speaking, a great company.",2

On their website I found CEO email claims he reads and responds all emails, what do I get a generic email explaining policy from guess who the worthless customer support. Again if there was a way to give them a negative star that would appropriate.",1
"They send me books now and again when I have asked them to, and paid them. You must have heard of them. They're great",2
Difficult at first to be heard because of difficulty hearing me but the lady dealing with my product missing a part issue dealt with the situation quickly was polite and very helpful,2
One of the best e-commerce companies in the world,2
"I have bought many things through amazon with most being delivered. However, I would not buy something if it is not specified to be sold and dispatched from amazon as both times I have the item was never delivered. Customer support is horrible, I was repeatedly told my order was going to arrive and I should wait then eventually told that I was no longer able to get a refund.",1
"great service nice products, not happy with packing",2
Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.,1
Absolutely fantastic company. Amazon has facilitated so many things for my small business that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. One company that has success through understanding their customers and anticipating needs.,2
Review text not found,1
Amazon continues to get worse. I have ordered Products with two delivery only to have delivery postponed a number of times. When it says shipped you can't cancel. Going with Wal-Mart.,0
"Love amazon.com, No issues so far and i truly amazed with the range of products. Keep up the good work",2
"All fine, all good. Delivery on time, product was fine. BUT. These geniuses left the product details printed on my gift card, which was a christmas present. Basically my girlfriend realize which present was, just reading the gift card. Unbelievable.",0
Very bad service I ordered a mobile 21 may and the delivery time show me 23 may at 8:00 clock night time so I will wait all day but didn't receive anything and when I see on Amazon order status it's show me my package is damaged and return back so you can wait until the next update so I wait 2 days and then the status updates your package not delivered so we send you back you refund but still today I didn't receive refund I call customer service and they said please wait.next time I will never buy anything from Amazon...very bad bad bad and worse service.,0
A very high quality service which over the past years has provided me with top quality items at very low prices and the customer service they provide for looking after their customers is excellent.,2
Hi I have noticed that in a few of my orders what arrives us a lot less than what I thought I had paid for.  This is misperception and is misleading which is unacceptable,0
Sometimes you really have to check price comparisons etc but after Ebay Amazon is the next best thing I’ve found....,1
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
"I'm quite picky when it comes to companies I deal with, and tend to leave reviews usually based on bad service. But this time I've something positive to raise. I was considering cancelling my prime membership and decided to do just that, but then forgot it for a week. Today the payment got taken (year subscription) and though well, that's 80 quid gone, but thought also that I'd log in and check if it's possible to cancel after a payment has been taken. Turns out it is and they'll pay you back for unused time, no fuss, no having to call them. Simple.",2
"Amazon is a very good sites in online shopping and there is almost everything you need and displays the items in a good way, but the problem is the delay in shipping and price if solved this problem to become Amazon one of the best shopping sites in the world.Thank you...",2
I think their prime shipping option is great. quick delivery,2
Amazon stop using Hermes. They are useless. Or at least state on the order you are using them so we can then not order> They are your suppliers so start taking responsibility instead of passing the buck. I say again in case you are the only ones who do not know (or do not want to know) Hermes are useless. Goods not turned up. No idea when they will,0
With Prime membership my orders are not delivered! Good job Amazon!!,0
Usually like their support but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1
Amazon delivery personnel have twice left my parcels in the public foyer area of my apartment block despite me giving specific delivery instructions NOT to do that. I intend to avoid purchasing from them in future.,0
"My international package got held at customs. Amazon didn’t take responsibility and deferred me to DHL. DHL experience was another challenge. Trying to figure out why my package didn’t arrive, I was transferred 3 times—I’m not kidding, from one DHL to the other(every time I gave them my tracking number). Finally I got to their “investigation/research team. This gentleman named Mark put me through the ringer. Concisely put, he said they didn’t get a hold of my sister (recipient) and he wonders whether to hold OR destroy the package.Then he sends an email saying that Customs is requesting a Public Health Certificate—w..the hell?..I think. So I’m like I have no idea what a PHC is. So, my sister there thinks this is going to be a lot of trouble, so I emailed Mark saying, “just send it back” (I was feeling defeated and like it was going to be a waste of time) So, he next sends me an email requesting the following:“I am following up with you regarding your request to return your shipment to the Origin. In order to make this change, DHL USA requires an authorization letter from the account holder.The letter should be written using your company’s Letterhead and requires: · Your name · Your title · Your signature · The return address · Your DHL import express account number (beginning with the numbers 95 or 96).· Clarification of your need for return to the Origin.If you do not have a 95/96 DHL import account number, please provide your export account number instead.Once completed please send your attached PDF/Word document via email to uscsdocuments or directly send it back to us here and be sure to ‘Reply All.’ I set a follow up for tomorrow no later than 5PM your local time. If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 877-297-6031Thank you for choosing DHL”Again I’m like WTH? What’s a 96/97 DHL import number? EtcSo I sent him an email saying “Listen, I’m just an Amazon.com customer. I shopped, paid extra for international, expecting my 82 y/o mom would get the Leg Brace to help with her sciatic pain. Why are you talking to me like I’m a corporation. That’s Amazon. I told him I needed to hear by the end of the day. He did not reached out. I tried to talk to Amazon and it was IMPOSSIBLE. When I finally outsmarted them and they were going to give me a call back if I left my number, mysteriously, they said that specific feature wasn’t working. In small tiny letters, a number for internationals having trouble with their packages to USA. So, being the ONLY number, I called it. I kid you not, I was on hold for about 11 minutes. First, it was music for about 9mins. Then, it got creepy; music was gone and there was only silence. I tried to talk to someone and nobody answered just silence and then “call dropped”.I might be upset but above all, I want you to know that unfortunately, we are giving Amazon.com too much power.",0
"Amazon fan! They are fantastic! You find everything you need at great prices and fast delivery. They customers service has always been fast, efficient and super polite. And I do purchase a lot with them and have needed help with stuff. Any issue is always resolved quick and easy",2
Earlier I was happy but this time my parcel come late and the goods's price was a lot a bit high.,1
Always order in Amazon their product are excellent and always in time.,2
"I always order textbooks from amazon, because of reasonable price.",2
there shipping is to high on some of there stuff,1
"I dont like it, because You cant pay via paypal, but mainly shipping prices are always so unclear. I prefer aliiexpress any time.",1
"Buying at Amazon is always a pleasant experience. The on-line shop is well organized. It is easy to find the article of you choice and having user reviews available is invaluable to make up your mind. One-click ordering is so much easier than any other web-shop. It is also easy to understand the status of your order while it is being processed and shipped. In the unlikely event that you want to return an article, Amazon is a pleasant experience as well.",2
"Every item I've ordered from Amazon as always arrived on time, keep me informed of the journey of items. People blame amazon but its coming from elsewhere, where ever you've ordered it from, then it goes to the warehouse, from warehouse to the delivery address. I've had no problems.",2
"Love Amazon, but the shipping companies they use always leave packages on front doorstep and then snap a picture.  As if that would prevent someone from stealing them.  Then when you complain, it becomes your problem!",1
"have prime which allows certain free books. ordered one today and was charged for it. after 1 and half hours on the phone finally spoke to a human who arranged a credit, Told me to re-order after he cancelled it. Ordered again and was again cheged for the book, will be cancelling PRIME,,",0
"They have reliable drivers masked by rude, and drivers that totally dis respect me as a customer. Throwing parcels over or by back gate saying handed to me in person. Yesterday had message saying parcel delivered to my safe place. Not there. Told to knock at doors to find it.",1
"Don't waste your money to pay for same day delivery.If you are lucky probably you will receive, but in most cases,no.and if you call customer service, you only get an apology.",0
"Goods always delivered quickly and as described. Comminication is excellent. On the one problem I had with a faulty camera when it was still in warranty, they replaced it immediately.",2
Some reason my last review was removed. love this site for great deals and super FAST shipping.,2
"Most of items are in decent condition, but a few items are fake.Be careful.",1

"They were good but nowadays they are joking. There are many options for us to shop, we just need to spend some time to find the right store or site. As customers our laziness made Amazon as a big company, it is not about their product or services. The painful experience you will get from Amazon is when your item is not shipped on time or received damaged items. As they already moved to technologies business like AWS, Alexa, they don’t care about their e-commerce business. This company will go down if they operate their e-commerce business like this & that will also happen only because of customers like us.",0
"items stolen AGAIN!! This is not the first time .. have installed a delivery box and still the items are left by the door , so even put written instructions on the delivery box and the door nope still the same ... so delivery drivers cant read??? Do they not have to pass a crime check??Have been told latest scam is delivery driver takes a picture then tells his mates where to go .. BUT legally you can claim a refund or replacement as LAW state this is not been delivered if left on door step , that's why the drivers say handed to resident which again is not proof of delivery ... im cancelling anything to do with amazon prime , alexas are going in the bin the company has got so corrupt with its ""AI"" bull crap all that is, is a way to watch and listen more to you, AMAZON your a disgrace with incompetence drivers who steal and con us and you ... BUT hey you need a heart to care !!!!!!!",0
Fees are high sellers and no support..unable to get anyone on line from seller support..extremely frustrating.,0
I wish I could make it zero stars these guys are complete fools! And a customer service people are from some other goddamn country that doesn't give a crap about anything and they won't let you talk to a supervisor they sent it to the wrong house twice! They send me a picture of a red house and I live in a white house and these fools can't figure this out! I tried to get my stuff delivered by UPS and they won't do it! I flagged down a Amazon van and they told me they're hiring temporary fools that don't know what they're doing so here's my advice buy your stuff from anybody but Amazon,0
"Whilst Amazon seem to deliver books ok, they failed to deliver a bottle of wine, their customer service website is dire and keeps taking you round in complete circles, I have now cancelled the order but there was no opportunity to speak to anyone and when on screen they said they were phoning me that was a complete lie, the phone never rang despite several attempts, Their customer service is just an utter waste of  space",0
"Well now, Jeff Bezos must be hurting for money.  I pay him for his streaming service, and now he is charging me again.  It would appear he needs to reevaluate his relationship with those who have made him filthy rich.  250 seconds of commercial five time in a 60-minute TV show, and I need to pay him again not to watch those commercials.  That's worse than free TV with rabbit ears.",0
"I have purchased many things through Amazon over the course of several years. They carry hard-to-find merchandise, at reasonable prices. Frequently their prices beat what I can get locally as well. Customer service has always been excellent, and my products have almost always shipped immediately. The few times that I have been dissatisfied with what I received, exchanging the item was simple and hassle-free. Amazon.com has become my family's go-to source to get almost everything short of perishable groceries. (They do sell those, too...I just get them at my local grocer.) Especially like the wish list feature, so I know that I am getting someone something that they really want.",2
"If I could leave a zero I would. I have used Amazon for years, shopping, prime, kindle and audible and one of the things I ordered this year was an iPhone 14 for my daughter’s Christmas present.  When I opened the box there was a box of biscuits inside. I got onto Amazon straight away on the chat and the guy told me not to worry that it would be sorted immediately. I took photos and made a police report but Amazon wouldn’t contact the police about the report so I had to post back the box of biscuits 😡 I am still waiting for my refund even though the biscuits have been received by them by now and they keep saying it takes up to 30 days to process the return and refund. It is Christmas week and I am supposed to have a phone for my daughter for Christmas, it’s the only thing she asked for but I won’t receive the refund in time. Amazon do not care about their customers, it’s just money, money, money with them. Well I may well be only one person but as soon as I receive my refund I will never use Amazon again and will delete my account",0
I've always been a huge fan ever since I found their site! They make my life better when I don't have to go out for so many items! I can get my necessities while I wait for my other items to be delivered to my door!,2
"Fast delivery, amazing service, wanted to return a hand trolley, processed by amazon within 3 days. Easy returns. Will buy again from them.",2
Ordered a set of shoes online and they have already begun to fall apart at the edges... not pleased.Watch out who you buy from on Amazon!!!,0
"Received an email that my package was handed to the resident, that would be me, hmm funny thing is I was never handed anything let alone my package. Went to mailbox and my package was sitting along side the road next to me mailbox. How lazy this Amazon driver was!! Amazon be careful who you hire!",0
Refund not returned within 7 days as promised. Live chat unwilling to help. Extended it to 14 business days and asked me to call back,0
"Horrendous. Prime is a joke, extortionate price and now films have adverts. Just shocking with the amount they make. Rubbish service.",0
"On time, well packaged and never really had any problems, thansk Amazon",2
what can I say .. good,2
"on shipment time. When I order sometime for one day shipment I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
The worst experience I have ever had with a customer service is hands down Amazon. If you can find there phone number you just can’t understand a word they are saying. English is there second language! Good luck,0
Amazon is quick and easy shopping with a lot of items for sale except liquor and smokes.,2
"Before taking money: We can deliver these items tomorrow if you hurry and order in the next 4 hours! After taking money: Ok, we can deliver these items but it's now going to be in three different orders over two days for efficiency. On first delivery day: Did we say today? Oops, we meant tomorrow.On second delivery day: It's now 10 pm.. guess you figured it out. Tomorrow?Next day: Did we say today? How about two days from now?Two days later: What? How about Monday or Tuesday?Seriously it was going to be a timesaver. Cancelled all the items. Drove to the store and bought them and got home all in the same time frame it took Amazon to send an email asking if I was gonna continue my Prime membership.Yep.. maybe on Monday.. Thursday.. two weeks from how.. who knows....",0
"I ORDERED THREE DIFFERENT DESIGNS OF STRING BRAS FROM THEM. THEY SENT ME ALL THREE OF THE SAME STRING BRAS. IT DIDNT TAKE LONG FOR ME TO GET MY ORDER. I COULDN'T TRACK IT, NOR DID THEY SEND ANY UPDATE INFO.  WHEN I WENT BACK TO AMAZON TO CHECK FOR MY PURCHASE'S-IT WAS WIPPED CLEAN AS IF I NEVER PLACED A ORDER. I HAVE SEVERAL MORE ITEMS COMING FROM THEM. AFTER THIS, NO NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM THEM. NO ORDER SLIP COME ALONG W/THE PKG.  I WILL STICK W/EBAY. IF I COULD GIVE THEM ZERO STARS, I WOULD. FIRST N LAST TIME PLACING A ORDER W/THEM.   I ORDERED A TWO-PC RAIN SET FOR MY HUSBAND. IT WAS EXCELLENT. IT FIT HIS MEDIUM SIZE. SO I ORDERED ME ONE. EBAY IS STILL MY NUMBER ONE SITE. NEVER ORDER LINGERIE FROM THEM. IT DOESNT RUN ITS SIZE ON AMAZON. A THREE X IS A SMALL.😠😠😠 WASTE OF MY MONEY N TIME(AMAZON). SOME ITEMS, NOT ALL.ONE MAD SISTER,PEEDY,",1
I used to shop a lot from amazon but lately I do not like their order any more.,1
I wish I could rate of zero I’ve had those experience with Amazon! The customer service representatives do not understand English most of them are overseas. Manager was totally belligerent has no empathy for anything I waited over 10 hours for UPS to come pick up the package and all she did was cancel my return expecting me to wait another day at home with no resolution,0
"There were seven $100 gift cards purchases on my business account which I did not authorize. Trying to get to a human for reimbursement is virtually impossible. Once I reached someone (offshore) three separate times over a two week period, they told me it had been escalated and would be reimbursed within 2-3 business days. The third time I called, they said there was nothing else they could do because it was in a different department that didn't have a phone number! Only email and snail mail. So it's been 2.5 weeks, three of the same promises and apologies, no resolution and no phonecall as promised within 24 hours of each call. Shame on you Amazon for your poor customer service and while we know $700 is nothing to Bezos, to us middle class people, it's a lot.",0
I had bought several cellphone cases. The delivery from Amazon is fast and with great packaging. ,2
Refunds from Amazon. Twice a gift card never turned up for someone can only presume driver dishonest. Three times now I have been promised my money back but I am going round in circles trying to get it. Waste of space,0
"2nd time in as many months, that a driver leaked a significant amount of oil on the driveway. Poorly trained drivers with little common sense. Amazon needs to make an effort to educate its drivers. Last time, 4 in the morning waking the household up with very loud exhaust and came back twice due to being confused.",0
Wish I could give less stars.Where to start apart from the fact this company are ablist(discriminate against disabled people)Won't help and when you ask to speak to a manager the advisor says the manager can do the same as me.When trying to return an item be sure you have bought a printer as you will have to print a label.Just don't buy the printer from Amazon as if it's faulty or the wrong item you won't be able to print the return label.Amazon are a joke and having call centres in foreign countries is not very helpful for someone who is deaf.If you want my opinion DONT USE AMAZON. THEY ARE TERRIBLE,0
Sometime the delivery can take longer than expected from retailers through Amazon and occasionally an item will run out of stock. However most of the time you receive a fast and efficient service. Recommended!,2
"I go on, I click what I want, I agree with the price or not, if I don’t I delete the item and find another. I complete order and wait... nothing complicated and I can’t fault them I really can’t Think it’s easy to blame the website when it’s really the individual seller that’s at fault",2
Wouldn’t buy any branded clothing off of here because it’ll turn out to be either very poor quality or fake. However everything else is spot on,1
"App is great, prices are great, deliveries are typically on time.",2
I'm a prime member for the past 9 years. The first few years there were some hiccups but it's gotten better. Some of the items I bought got one day or even same day shipping if I ordered it in time. Wish they had kept the pre-order discounts when it came to video games since video games are so expensive nowadays. Other than that no complaints really.,2
"I shop there often, and always return. If you are looking for electronics or so its always the easist way :) through amazon.",2
Prime subscription is nothing but west of money! Delays in the delivery always!! I don't recommend it at all.,0
There was a promised delivery date when I ordered. After order suddenly the delivery date was unknown but still they send me an invoice and expecte me to pay for it before I received the goods. And the support told me the stock is not updated in real time. That is absolutely ridiculous to have a system you can't trust for items in stock.,0
"Buying an item is fine, however returning is quite a hassle, first my package got lost then they were unable refund me my money because they lost my package. The chat room with them was spotty and 2 minutes turned into an hour. I'm actually kind've frustrated by the whole interaction.",1
Both Amazon and a seller on Amazon cheated me out of 200£ on some shoes I bout on the page They said they were original absolute lie send them back said they refunded me but never got it and called Amazon and was met with abuse from the Amazon agent,0
"Fraudulent Company,7/10 times do NOT deliver goods/items.Do not refund when requested.The SELLER VERIFICATION team is extremely inefficient,unprofessional,very very rude.Stay Away!",0
I order all the time off Amazon. Sometimes they get my address correctly. Sometimes they don't. I'm fed up with it. It's happening most weeks now. And I've put a special instruction where my address is. Grrrrrrr 😣,1
Hello my name is mike green I am contacting you because I have been dealing with multiple issues at my amazon facility in am currently a level 1 employee at las 1 henderson nv.I am a very motivated associate who is eager to learn and grow in this company.I have spoken to many floor managers that I would like to be enrolled into any and all trainings/classes that would help me advance my career. My managers tell me they submit my tickets I check in with learning and nothing ever seems to exsist on my behalf. I am one of the most efficent and hard working employees in las 1 dock receive. I always take the initiative to do what needs to be done without being told I drop whatever im doing  instantly when a manager needs me to do something. And yet employees that do not work near as hard as I do get enrolled in classes and receive promotions to pg or pa. I was told hard workers in this company have many chances and ways to advance but I have not been given any opportunity.I have discussed all of this with multiple ops managers floor managers pg's and pa's yet nothing is ever done.I have worked so well in one days I recieved a total of 13 raffles for my work performance and yet I still do not get recognized for any of my additional trainings I have even helped a training ambassadors train a class and employees but cant get my self trained or certified i would really love to be trained and certified in every department here at las 1 if possible.Patrice was one of my trainers and senior managers that motivated me with her story of her story and  advancements in the company when I heard her speak in knew I wanted to follow in her footsteps but my management team is not helping with these cituations at all some of these managers tell me thank you mike your making our job easier or they say mike can you slow down your making some of us look average or work a little harder.Just recently I helped my team hit record on out shift that we have never ever hit before. So please if there is anything you could do it would be highly appreciated.,1

With that he started yelling at me and physically attacked me. I complained to Amazon who told me they would fill out a ""driver feed back form"". They did not want to know where, when or a description of the driver. After this I received an email from Amazon asking me if the representative was able to solve the delivery problem!

Usually like their assistance but don't approve of the very expensive 3rd party sales. They should have a filter so we don't have to see them if we don't want to.,1
Amazon has had so many hiccups over the year I question if even shipping here is worth it anymore.,1
"Worst customer service ever !!!! I order some protein and when it arrived, it was not the one I ordered. I contacted Amazon who told me to send it back and they will send out a replacement and refund. Was told it would be delivered on Sat 27 Nov, said online I had been dispatched. So then got a email saying delivery delayed and will be delivered as soon a possible ?? Contacted customer service and they just fobbed me off with excuses and told me I just have to wait !  They couldn’t close down the chat quick enough. Absolute disgusting customer service.  Not the first time this has happened to me.",0
I love the kindle and cant wait for the new version!!!!,2
"I have used amazon for several years. My wife has opened a account with them. She ordered a watch from amazon for delivery to me. When it arrived there was no watch in the box. I  returned the watch to amazon. Amazon agreed to a refund, but never got the refund. Amazon now say there was no watch in the box when I returned the watch. I my wife and most of my friends will nolonger use a company like this.Would like to hear from anyone who has had the same problem.",0
"Keeps charging me money even after several attempts to cancel my amazon video subscription. Only answer I get is ""sorry you're not in the system, we can't help you"" which sounds fishy cause they certainly have my credit card info...",0
Okay customer assistance but their order is amazing,1
I have a membership and it doesn't even matter. Amazon false advertises their delivery times and customer service is terrible. I would not recommend this company. It may seem fast and convenient  but honestly you'd have better luck just ordering from Walmart and ANY OTHER STORE Don't waste your money,0
Be carful on Amazon drivers . They are opening in them self your back yard and come in to garden with out your permission. Next driver has stated has delivered  parcel to customer into hands when customer was not at home ! Over phone costumer service are not knowledgeable and you as a customer is not able speak with management to solve an issue.,0
Excellent. The prime fee is well worth payingFree next day order on many things Free films although I've one one niggle. Not all are free on prime I looked for a film over 20 years old And although I pay for membership they want £5.49 extraI found it elsewhere on DVD for £1.99Ordered it. Now it's mine to keep foreverI never pay their silly prices for film assistance I already pay for,1
Beware when making a purchase .. 2 items I purchase said delivery before 1 pm next day .. By the time you get though payment  THIS became 7pm ... Delivered after 8pm ...,0
"Your shipment staff are rubbish, they just throw packages into porch and walk off leaving porch door open.This is a repeat complaint and you do nothing about training. They are all THICK AND USELESS",1
"Brilliant - What we ordered from an Amazon store - Canon Ink Cartridges, arrived the next day and delivery person friendly - even wearing a mask",2
"I cannot believe this actually happened and I do not believe it was done by mistake. Instead of the meta quest 3 we received 2 boxes of cat food. I was given pass code to driver which kind of gives it away that it's an expensive product, so I don't know if the driver is the culprit. Straight away tried to contact amazon through the app which was not easy, after explaining the situation to a representative on the chat he said this time ups will collect the return and I will be refunded within 14 days. Not sure what to make of that! I had to reorder as its a birthday gift for my son. Again I received email that a pass code is required. I am now very worried same thing may happen. I will be recording once I hear a knock on the door and make the driver witness what's in the parcel this time. Wonder if anyone else has experienced anything like this",0
"We have been loyal customers for decades - spending well over $150,000 in the past with Amazon.Recently, without warning or explanation, we were banned from Reviewing and asking Product Questions.   We inquired with the Amazon Moderation Review team and got no explanation.   All the reviews we had left for products we had purchased were removed - ALL of them.   Many years worth of reviews with photos.   These reviews had *thousands* of helpful votes.We are closing all accounts including Amazon credit card accounts.  We are closing our Amazon accounts.

Amazon in se è top ma la sua assistente clienti fa pena è davvero una vergogna,1
It is true every negative review about this company is the truth! I was a LOYAL customer of Amazon for about 6 years then all of a sudden I get an email saying that my account has been closed and all of my orders will be cancelled. I tried to go back into the app to see what was going on but I wasn’t able to! That’s right so they STILL have my payment method stored in their database meaning they can charge my card whenever they feel like it even though the account has been closed! Please please please take my word for it and do not use Amazon just go somewhere else such as eBay to make your purchases because eBay has the exact same things as Amazon if not even more!!!! Screw Amazon and I’ve already told all of my friends and family not to use their service anymore.,0
Okay customer assistance but their order is amazing,1
Want a robbing company took my money never got my kids toys at Christmas still no refund all you get told is we are looking in to this but they don’t I will never shop with Amazon again parcels go missing to not right,0

"Do not put any giftcards or balance in your amazon account. I have been a prime member for over a year and have purchased $10000s worth of items. Amazon pushed the idea of reloading the account balance, and even offered incentives to do so. Once I added money to the account, it was instantly closed due to ""unauthorized users accessing the account""So in order to protect the $2000 I recently added to the account, they decided to steal them for themselves.This is a common scam according to google, never load any giftcards onto amazon, never buy giftcards from amazon and never signup for amazon prime for a year in advance.",0
Their customer service agents lie to you just to get you off the phone I put money on a gift card by mistake thinking I was making an Amazon credit card payment now I can't do anything with that money other than make a purchase from Amazon which I don't want to do because there's stuff is cheap and made overseas instead of in America they run millions of people out of business the undermining their prices and setting up a monopoly if I could leave zero Stars I would I will never ever deal with Amazon again they're liars cheats and thieves,0
"I love Amazon and how it brings us things we want the next day, but they really need to train their support people better. It's always so frustrating to either be asked for information you have already given them or them clearly not understanding what you are asking, if a question is somewhat unusual. Reading from the script with 0 critical thinking is just not acceptable enough.",1
"Ordered a product on 23rd January which I was told got ""stuck"" in final shipping and was advised to cancel and re order. Re ordered on the 2nd of February and still no shipment 3 days later. Contacted customer service who assured me they bumped up shipping. 7th of February still not shipped so I contact customer service again who assure me my item will be delivered between the 12 - 16 February. Now I receive an email to say item gone out of stock. Nothing but lies. Never again. Avoid at all costs.",0
"The customer service is mediocre at best. I have been waiting for almost 2 weeks for someone to contact me and unlock my account even after I explained to them that it was hacked and the situation has since been resolved. They keep asking me about a ""form"" that I need to fill out, and then they say that they have completed the form and someone will contact me the next day. I've been hearing this every other day since 10/30/2020. I understand that there's a pandemic happening, but that should not stop the workers from doing their job in a decent timeframe.",0
"I only gave 1 star as thats tge only option they dont deserve any stars . Ive been using amazan for years but they have seriously gone down hill , 3 times now no show .. parcels , first two excuses were item unable to be delivered damaged , took 3 weeks for a refund. Now they say its been delivered and they handed it to resident .. well my ring door bell says differently ??? There was no delivery at all .. what a sham amazan is now thats it for me amazan can do one ....",0
"Amazon is always misplacing my packages and their only solution to something I actually needed is to refund my money or replace the item!! What are they even doing to the shipment people or shipment support?! Recently, USPS, the worst package shipment support in this country was tasked to deliver my air conditioner. Why is beyond me, because even the USPS rep was surprised by this. Amazon customer support provided no empathy or solution. I called USPS and they themselves had no idea where the package 📦 was which was both bewildering and upsetting!!! Amazon customer support no longer seems to follow-up, so I figure, shipment people are ripping them off because they know Amazon will just simply replace the item and that somehow everything is supposed to be right in my world?! I'm a pretty honest person, and that just doesn't sit well with me. Especially when it's hot as all get out in my apartment and I expected to have what I ordered on the date that it was shown to delivered. What made matters even worse; all of the accessories arrived on time!!!! ",1

"Have been a Amazon Prime member for 2 years. It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the order trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get items replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students. I still love Amazon Products but don't know if they are worth the shipping hassle. Questioning Prime Membership. (Netflix for Movies  is better)",1
I have an Amazon credit card which gives me dollars towards my purchases on Amazon. This in combination with competitive pricing and great product selection makes it great to purchase at Amazon.,2

Customer service SUCKS!  I have had 3 items break in the last 6 months.  Amazon makes you jump through hoops to return an item.  They DO NOT make clear who I am buying a product from as some item are a 3rd party seller.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR 3rd PARTY SELLERS as amazon does nothing to resolve issues with defective items.  They make it virtually impossible and jump through so many hoops hoping you will just give up.  They sell inferior Chinese built items that break down LONG before they should.,0
"Always a great service, I’m amazed how they manage to provide the deliveries on time day after day. Customer service has been excellent over the phone always helpful for any minor hiccups.",2
"Amazon used to be a great company but not anymore. I subscribed to several products only to be it's out of stock but there are other options which is the same product only it's literally triple the price. I canceled one of subscriptions and they not only shipped it they double shipped it and charged me for both orders. In that instance I was able to ""prove"" that I canceled well in advance of the deadline and I was refunded however the refund process is now 30 days. I shouldn't have to wait 30 days for their error. What out for the sneaky shipping fees from these Chinese companies that you may not even notice because it's in the fine print selling an item for $2 but the shipping fee is $9.99. Amazon is becoming more like Temu everyday. Sad when a company is making billions in profits but feels the need to steal from their long time customers. ",0
Honestly is really cheap and come in just as they said there were! Would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know it now! They have everything I need or want!,2
"I simply love Amazon, I have been a customer now for 3 years, I have bought a mixture of things, never had a problem and have been satisfied with their service, the prime is the best, get my goods next day, plus with my subscription I get prime video, music and free reads on books. I have found nearly everything I want on their site. From door locks, lighting, wallpaper, grass seed, bedding, towels to fashion and make up. Its just so super easy, everything is well packaged and I have never returned anything. I must have ordered more than 200 items so far, happy with them all. So keep up the good work x",2

"My international package got held at customs. Amazon didn’t take responsibility and deferred me to DHL. DHL experience was another challenge. Trying to figure out why my package didn’t arrive, I was transferred 3 times—I’m not kidding, from one DHL to the other(every time I gave them my tracking number). Finally I got to their “investigation/research team. This gentleman named Mark put me through the ringer. Concisely put, he said they didn’t get a hold of my sister (recipient) and he wonders whether to hold OR destroy the package.Then he sends an email saying that Customs is requesting a Public Health Certificate—w..the hell?..I think. So I’m like I have no idea what a PHC is. So, my sister there thinks this is going to be a lot of trouble, so I emailed Mark saying, “just send it back” (I was feeling defeated and like it was going to be a waste of time) So, he next sends me an email requesting the following:“I am following up with you regarding your request to return your shipment to the Origin. In order to make this change, DHL USA requires an authorization letter from the account holder.The letter should be written using your company’s Letterhead and requires: · Your name · Your title · Your signature · The return address · Your DHL import express account number (beginning with the numbers 95 or 96).· Clarification of your need for return to the Origin.If you do not have a 95/96 DHL import account number, please provide your export account number instead.Once completed please send your attached PDF/Word document via email to uscsdocuments or directly send it back to us here and be sure to ‘Reply All.’ I set a follow up for tomorrow no later than 5PM your local time. If you have any questions or concerns, please call us at 877-297-6031Thank you for choosing DHL”Again I’m like WTH? What’s a 96/97 DHL import number? EtcSo I sent him an email saying “Listen, I’m just an Amazon.com customer. I shopped, paid extra for international, expecting my 82 y/o mom would get the Leg Brace to help with her sciatic pain. Why are you talking to me like I’m a corporation. That’s Amazon. I told him I needed to hear by the end of the day. He did not reached out. I tried to talk to Amazon and it was IMPOSSIBLE. When I finally outsmarted them and they were going to give me a call back if I left my number, mysteriously, they said that specific feature wasn’t working. In small tiny letters, a number for internationals having trouble with their packages to USA. So, being the ONLY number, I called it. I kid you not, I was on hold for about 11 minutes. First, it was music for about 9mins. Then, it got creepy; music was gone and there was only silence. I tried to talk to someone and nobody answered just silence and then “call dropped”.I might be upset but above all, I want you to know that unfortunately, we are giving Amazon.com too much power.",0

"Good prices, quick order (via prime) and excellent customer support mean that I now buy most things through Amazon. They have removed the stress and risks of buying decents for me and I now receive a few parcels a week from them. In the rare cases when there are issues contacting customer support quickly resolves them.Update from my original 5 star review. Amazon have become more aggressive as they seek to monetise their high market share. Alexa continually tries to sell you more supports (you cannot stop this) to the point of ruining the user usage and has today signed me up for an audible subscription it offered my six year old and she declined  (Alexa has the recording DON’T sign me up).Customer support now don’t offer email and the chat use literally two hours of life I’ll never get back refusing to acknowledge the issue or allow me to raise a complaint. I used to be a a loyal customer who trusted Amazon to treat me with respect but increasingly feel more just a Pound sign in their eyes",1

Amazon can be acceptable but when its ordinary its ordinary. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty decent but they really do need to sort out their third party order  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1

"I've been using my Son's Prime account for 5+ years & now need to use my own account.I'm at my wits end after several calls to Customer Service which seems to be someone in a foreign country each time.After I enter my email address in the box, Amazon sends me a numeric code that I successfully enter in a box.  The problem begins here; Amazon asks me for the expiration date of an old credit card that I haven't used in years because it was compromised & closed.No matter how many times I enter my email  & enter their security code, authenticate my address...the program always asks the same question...""what is the expiration date of an expired credit card""!I want my account restored using my email.  The suggestions from support were ""get a new email or use my phone number instead"".  I run my life using a central email & don't want non urgent texts coming to my phone & I certainly don't want Amazon telling me to change my phone number should another issue arise were I to use my phone number.I know Amazon has sophisticated business on the corporate side, but the retail side must know a credit card expiration date to an old expired card?I authenticated all other information correctly.

Some items are highly overpriced and some were not brand new! I had trouble with my amazon account in the past due to address verification system (incorrect billing address), Amazon account specialist closed my account after a few orders. I had about 10 orders rage between 100-250 USD and my account was closed when I tried to order a new PC (600+ USD). Initially my account was put on hold and was asked to verify my billing statement.

"I have been an amazon prime member for yrs, Fraudulent charges were made on my Amazon account at the end of April, so because I disputed the charges Amazon locked me out of my prime account,(to be expected), except they didn't stop there, no they decided to rob me of my thousands of dollars in movie and music purchases, and all of my Amazon devices when they also deemed it appropriate to lock me out of my prime movie and music accounts, not to mention none of my Amazon Alexas and echos will work due to all being registered to my account that had fraudulent activity... So then I called Amazon and confirmed I did not make those purchases dozens of times and here we are 4-5 months later and I'm still locked out of all my stuff and services that have already been bought and paid for??? Which is weird, I have never had the clerk from the grocery store come into my house and take all the food I just bought from my fridge, freezer, and pantry.... I have never had the manager of kohls show up at my house and confiscate the school clothes I just bought for my children.... I am not sure why Amazon thinks it is acceptable to remove access to movies and music that have already been PAID for... Or how they think it is appropriate to block the functionality of my devices that have already been PAID for with the understanding they would FUNCTION!!! I am beyond disgusted with treatment and handling of this whole situation.... I'm honestly not even sure it's legal.... It seems alot like theft to me... I honestly don't ever want to purchase anything from Amazon ever again after this and neither do family and friends... a full refund for ALL of my movies, music, and devices would be appreciated",0
"We have been loyal customers for decades - spending well over $150,000 in the past with Amazon.Recently, without warning or explanation, we were banned from Reviewing and asking Product Questions.   We inquired with the Amazon Moderation Review team and got no explanation.   All the reviews we had left for products we had purchased were removed - ALL of them.   Many years worth of reviews with photos.   These reviews had *thousands* of helpful votes.We are closing all accounts including Amazon credit card accounts.  We are closing our Amazon accounts.   We are no longer shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods.This company is too big to care - we need to support other, smaller retailers before this evil company takes over the entire world.",0
"Amazon has been decent to me normally, but they have their ordinary parts as well. Like my last order was delivered to the wrong address and fortunately I have decent neighbors that put it on our mailboxes but I know not everyone is nice like them. This is not the first time it’s happened either, and a few times items were delayed for weeks before they said I would need to reorder! Not cool, but sometimes they offer little rebates but you have to really complain a lot to get them and they aren’t really worth it… all in all I’ll still be buying from them but the could really up their game being as big of a company as they are.",1
"Pretty fine support so far, but plenty to improve on deliveries and comunication still.Have Kindle unlimited and although is decent you are not able to search only within subscribed books. And the ""unlimited"" label is misleading, most of the best books are excluded.",1
"I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.",1

After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1
Amazon driver stole my package! I called Amazon the minute the driver marked it delivered amd yet the driver was never at my house. They said it was mistakenly scanned and that it would be delivered the next day. Nope and now they are blaming someone else. Shocking. Horrible service.,0
You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,1

"I purchased a $10 CPU cooler, the seller was Amazon themselves. I should've gotten the fan itself, thermal paste & backplate, but all I got is the fan.I was suspicious the second I realized I just got a fan, but I thought, maybe it's supposed to be like that (it's not) and then I applied thermal paste on my cpu, and tried screwing the cpu cooler down, but it didn't work. I need the backplate to screw it down.There is no option to actually contact support, I can either get my money back or a new product, both options require I send the product back. I do not get compensated for the expensive thermal paste of my own that I used.I'm writing this part a while later, I have sent the package back to where it came from, you can check on dhl.se this number 7135563356I also have a receipt where it said I'm returning this from DHLThey took a while to update anything, for the first nine days, it said I haven't even dropped of my package yet but I have. I got my money the next day.Don't give Amazon the benefit of the doubt like I did, just buy from websites with convinient money back policies. I told the manufacturers about Amazon too.What should Amazon have done: Send either a whole product, the missing parts, or give me my money back, without requiring me to ship the item back.",0

Plus, everything looks super sharp through the lenses.Honestly, buying glasses online was a bit of a gamble for me, but this turned out to be a total win.

Received a text message notifying that the driver tried calling us requesting for a safe place to hand over the parcel – despite the fact that we are currently in the house. There was no attempt to ring the door bell or knock on the door. Very poor effort from the driver.They will not respond to our text message and it is important that we get the item delivered in time for Christmas.,0

"So story short, somebody (who I don't know well) gave me a fake check of $2000. I used this money to buy Amazon gifts cards (physical cards NOT with my online account) at CVS.I slowly realized that this was a FRAUD. I called my banks and of course I called Amazon.FIRST, I called on THURSDAY. (7/11/2019) FIRST GUY was a man named Jay A. I told him my situation and he told me there was nothing on my account and I should call my bank. I was a bit confused and said ok. Later that day, I realized something: -Why would anything be on my Amazon account? I bought physical amazon cards, took pictures, and send it to this fraudster person, I didn't purchase these Amazon gift cards online. If Jay asked the proper questions he would have asked me to give him the amazon gift card numbers.SECOND CALL. SECOND GUY I talked to was a man name Astrid. I asked him if I could talk to Jay A, the first guy. He sternly told me no and that he would be able to help me. I repeated the same story, answered the same questions. I expressed my frustration and he said ""it's be gonna be okay sir."" 7/15/2019, 4 days later, I check my debit card balance and it's at -$1500 dollars. I call my bank, they said it's too late. Now I call Amazon, again.THIRD CALL, A women picks up to help me. I asked them if I could check the status of my situation. She said she had no information, she could only see the emails exchanged. So I had to retell the same story, again, and answer the same questions, again.FOURTH CALL, Couple days later, a women named Denise picks takes the case. She asks me to send photographs of the amazon gift cards and to provide details of the case. You could probably guess the response I had at this point - I've pretty much given up.Today is 7/22/2019 (~10 days later) and the case is finally closed.They were able to recover $21.",0
This company is the worst company I've ever dealt with the delivery drivers are absolutely horrible they opened Mt front door and threw a parcel into my living room when I managed to get intouch with customer chat they kept ending the chat on me on purpose about 3 times they say that orders had been delivered when they hadn't they have left parcels in my bin when I've asked them not to they are a disgrace and want closing down,0

"I’m truly shocked by this cumulative rating! How have people had this many bad experiences with Amazon?I purchased regularly from Amazon and I’m a prime member. I’ve never had issues with returns that couldn’t be resolved with a phone call. I have received hundreds of excellent products through their site.I’m not thrilled that they have a monopoly in this industry, but their innovation has made our lives easier. It’s amazing they can deliver products on the same day you order. And with no fee! I’ve been able to order items that I’d never find in a local store.I don’t love that. The majority of their products are made in China. But that’s true for every brick and mortar store as well. It isn’t Amazon‘s fault that factories have been outsourced to another country.I love that anyone who wants to order from Whole Foods can do so through Amazon. I’ve done this once and it was helpful.The return process couldn’t be easier. The length of time allowed for returns around the Christmas holiday is wonderful. I do wish they’d allow a longer window for returns during the rest of the year. With such high sales volume it would likely create chaos though.I’m a fan even if I don’t agree with all of their practices. Thank you for making my daily life more manageable.",2
"Amazon start sending items in the right size boxes, Penny pinching & making gifts look like they have been kept in the garage for 10 years, waited for a delivery for 8 days & I agreed to return, waited another week for replacement & it’s exactly the same, shopping online conveniences should have to include printing return labels & wasted petrol because you are penny pinching on boxes & postage 🤬",0

Today I've spent over half an hour, and still waiting, to resolve an issue. Can't get a call back. Having to use chat function. I'm onto maybe 5th person. Incidentally it's not complicated why I've had to contact them. Think it's time to close my account.",0
"I order many items for personal and business from Amazon.  Generally, the items from Amazon direct are delivered on time and work well.  However, in my recent experiences with refurbished computers and electronics I received several defective products from Amazon third party sellers.  The third party sellers did not respond for refunds or returns.  Amazon did NOT stand behind their A to Z Guarantee.  After several emails and phone calls to their customer service, it was a miserable experience. They misrepresented their return to me and never provided a refund.  I don't think the A to Z guarantee is real???   I learned my lesson, NOT to buy from anymore third party sellers, as Amazon won't warranty their products.",0
"from what I see here, you are all a bit frustrated, first of all, some of you wouldn't last even 2 hours as a courier at Amazon, you don't have the common sense to buy a parcel box, you only know how to complain, you have the impression that you have to let the courier treat you as if you were their boss, you have demands and some of you don't even say thank you for a correct shipment, not to mention those of you who lie that the packages haven't arrived, let the courier lose his job, some ….you are , in your work you will have a share of this",1
"I give Amazon a 3 out of 5 rating due to their affordable goods range, which is a definite plus. However, they need to address the issues of incorrect deliveries and improve their reshipping process to provide a smoother customer usage.",1
Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1

"Over the years I have spent thousands of pounds at Amazon. Puchasing from distance sellers is often a leap of faith - but not with Amazon. Should I be looking for high-value items I need to know that the supplier can be trusted to honour their commitments and service promises. Never once have I had a single bad experience or cause for complaint, and for this reason alone I am happy to forego reasonable price fluctuations with occasionally lower prices elsewhere as I know that I'll not be left high-and-dry with a problem. Basically, Amazon have got it right and afford their customers with the consideration and respect that is reflected in their deeds and service policy. For this reason, Amazon will get my preferential loyal custom for as long as their exemplary service continues.",2

"I no longer receive most of my items in two or three days. It takes almost a week. Normally within the time frame they give. I love Amazon. You have to understand how much they have grown! It is impossible to make sure all of their customers get there shipments in two days. Let's be logical. I was disappointed when my stuff started taking a week to get here as well. Amazon has always done the best they can for me, and I appreciate it. Even when I'm not the easiest to talk to.",2
Thank you Amazon for knowing that #blacklivesmatter,2
I have great confidence in Amazon as an online seller but also the way they manage the other sellers that sell through the online store. The products always arrive quickly and you get great value.,2
I think amazon are an awful company but due to online shopping being a must for some items you are left with little choice but to use them occasionally.The only decent thing with amazon is it is easy to get a refund.,1
"I have been having the worst interaction on Amazon. First, I paid for a 75 dollar controller that was supposed to be brand new. The controller turned out to be used and the code that came in the box was already redeemed. Now I just subscribed to prime thinking they will charge me at the end of the month. That was a farce because they just took 15 dollars out of my account within 5 minutes. Customer support told me it will be 3-5 business days until I get a refund.",1

"Prices are acceptable, and I've had acceptable interaction with customer assistance. Whenever I had an issue, they just refunded, no questions asked. Overall I'm happy with them.The problem is the purchasing interaction and scammers. The web UI can get very confusing, mixing new and used in the same page, sometimes a single listing is from a certain buyer, sometimes there are several, and so on. Can get lost easily.A big issue is with scams/fake reviews. Lots of listing are full of reviews for a completely different item. Sometimes the same listing includes different items, and others the seller switched items and kept all reviews. Very hard to tell which items are acceptable or average based on that.",1
"Honestly, I love Amazon in that it's convenient, and shipping is amazing. Pricing is often not particularly competitive; but it's just so easy. On the downside, I don't like supporting a company that routinely decides to censor books that don't conform to their Woke guidelines. I know it's perfectly legal because they're a private company, I just don't want to pay for it. So, I'm averaging out to 3-stars.",1

"I Purchased a Pair of Vibrathotics I purchased a pair of the Vibrathotics last week not knowing how they would work. So, when they got to my home, I opened them immediately and put them in my slippers. They had a good charge, so I was able to wear them for about two hours. I even had them on the high setting. I have nephropathy in both feet because of a serious back injure, and life. I'm 65 and I worked for 35 years in the film industry. My work involved a lot of lifting and very long days on my feet. I have a plate in my neck at C5-C7, I have Peripheral Nerve Disorders. Because of the problems with my neck and spine, I have nerve damage in both feet. Anyway, after about two hours with the Vibrathotics on high, I turned them off because my feet were burning, because of the nerve damage. So, the next day when I woke up, I noticed that my feet felt great. No pins and needles or nails being hammered into my foot or ankle. However, as things go, the pain started to slowly come back throughout the day. So, I put my slippers on and wore them for another two or three hours, and the same thing happened again. I was pain free for hours, then the pain would slowly creep in and I would put my slippers back on. This seems to be the system that works for me, but it may be different for you. I hope my story helps you with your feet health.  I love my Vibrathotics.                                            THE END",2
I have never dealt with such a sorry company in my life. Amazon has the most messed up charging practices and shipping practices. Their customer service is horrible when asking for help.

The door was unlocked, I was home, and up at 5:08 AM. The package as per delivery instructions could have been left at the front door!This is one of many times Amazon said they tried to deliver, but never even got out of their truck to try.The note from the Tracking told me to contact the carrier for information on the delivery. No Number, No address, just told me to contact the carrier. Who is the carrier? Who do I contact?I called customer service, I thought they could help. They simply said SORRY, we will try again tomorrow. (It was supposed to be delivered yesterday, What happened to today?)I asked the customer service rep to give me the number to the carrier. He said Amazon is the carrier but he didn't have the contact information, and could not get it.

"Amazon is always misplacing my packages and their only solution to something I actually needed is to refund my money or replace the item!! What are they even doing to the shipment people or shipment support?! Recently, USPS, the worst package shipment support in this country was tasked to deliver my air conditioner. Why is beyond me, because even the USPS rep was surprised by this. Amazon customer support provided no empathy or solution. I called USPS and they themselves had no idea where the package 📦 was which was both bewildering and upsetting!!! Amazon customer support no longer seems to follow-up, so I figure, shipment people are ripping them off because they know Amazon will just simply replace the item and that somehow everything is supposed to be right in my world?! I'm a pretty honest person, and that just doesn't sit well with me.

Now the seller must answer to Amazon and i'm sure Amazon will put them on notice for failure to meet the customer needs. I will always be a Amazon Prime Member.",2

When it doesn't try, it's kind of a disaster, but I've had more decent interactions than average.average interactions have included 1) getting dropped from their referral platform for absolutely no reason (accused of violating platform policy); 2) having packages stolen from my porch and having CS ghost me in trying to figure out a resolution; 3) having third party sellers shirk responsibility for problems and having Amazon tell me it's not their fault, or 4) selling fake items or lying about material content or other configuration.In general, I think they're better than plenty of their peers.",1

Amazon asked me for a review of their Prime membership.

I got an email on 13/01 telling me about the delay for my order. which stated : *If the order won't arrive by the time you need it, you can cancel the order or an individual item from your order by visiting Your Account, and viewing the order details. As long as the item hasn't entered the dispatch process,you'll be able to cancel it.*However, this was not true and it actually was impossible to cancel the order, either on my account or by contacting the supplier ( as per automated message on my account) who said that only Amazon could cancel it and also said that my payment was still pending , which is also untrue.I am now told by their advisors that it is not possible for them to cancel the order until it has been dispatched!!!!! I think I am just being fobbed off with random  excuses/explanations. This is ridiculous, makes no sense whatsoever and istotally unacceptable.This email also says: *We're sorry about the delay in getting your order to you, but I'm pleased to tell you that we're preparing it for dispatch now.**Within the next business day you should receive an e-mail from us confirming that the following items have been dispatched:*This ,too, is untrue as apparently they are still trying to locate the item and it has not been dispatched yet. But I do not want it  sent to me, I want it cancelled, as I have been saying since 13/01, and  my money refunded but according to their advisors this cannot be done until it has been dispatched.And apparently there is no way of getting this complaint escalated to a non existent complaint department as I a told the customer service is  also the complaint department . Resolver is not an option either as Amazon UK has decided not to accept complaints raised via Resolver.Absolutely disgusting customer serviceNEVER AGAIN",0
Really bad service over the last two months. I turns out multiple items that were listed as Prime were not in stock.  Can’t depend on them for delivering items for my company on time. Going back to other sources and cancelling Prime,0
Happy though still some problems in it. Nowadays make delay for item order,1
Great prices and service. Shipping time and cost not ideal to Australia though,2
I turn to Amazon for all my gift giving and hard to find shopping!  They are loyal and easy for refunds.  ,2
dealing with used goodss can be a nightmare sometimes. The used listings often don't contain enough info and goods overview to give you an idea about the condition.,1
"This business website is superb. World know this website buying it all goodss i.e. home groceries, gadgets, electronic devices, garments.",1
I hate amazon they mess up every other order and waste my time. The amount of times I see “delivered” go outside and nothing there.,0

"They clearly do not care about the customers who keep them in business. Agents don't even listen to you on the phone, they just talk over you and then hang up. Their chat function is hidden so that you can't even find it. And they send automated responses to emails without even reading them. I had to speak with FIVE people to finally get a refund on a defective item. It's beyond ridiculous. Take your business to someone who deserves it. Amazon does NOT.",0
"The worst customer service…. Tried to change my phone number on my account the first rep told me they don’t have my email as an account, and I told him I receive emails about my orders all the time and then he verified my address only to hang up on me. The next rep told me she’d send an email to me to show my license and it’ll take 48 hours… the email eas never sent to me",0
"Bought things at amazon a few times and ot never goes smoothly. Amazon uses dhl and I've got some average usages with them. I also preordered a game about two weeks ago. After telling a friend about it she ordered it a few hours later aswell. My friend got a order date and got it yesterday. Meanwhile I'm still waiting for mine to be send, left alone getting a order date. Obviously they arent totally terrible as they do send the packages and have acceptable prices. I just don't like their choice of order support and my usages so far haven't been that acceptable.",1

Customer service SUCKS!  I have had 3 items break in the last 6 months.  Amazon makes you jump through hoops to return an item.  They DO NOT make clear who I am buying a product from as some item are a 3rd party seller.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR 3rd PARTY SELLERS as amazon does nothing to resolve issues with defective items.  They make it virtually impossible and jump through so many hoops hoping you will just give up.  They sell inferior Chinese built items that break down LONG before they should.,0
Happy with the products delivered on time,2
"I just had a easy non-frustrating experiece with a young man named Edwardo while trouble shooting ""for me"" problem. I so appreciate a kind soul that you can hear in their voice something that inspires you to smile and appreciate the cuteness to their personality.  Hey Amazon this ones a keeper! ps this conversation just happened. 👊",2
Prices are getting higher compared to a few years ago.Shipping seems to have gotten faster though,1
"I’ve never had this big of a problem with Amazon before and have been a happy Prime customer for years. Ordered something for next day delivery which was due today, I’d received the expected time and had the ‘8 stops away notification’, I could see that the driver was only a few streets away. I’d been waiting all afternoon for it to turn up and was sitting in the living room with full view of the street and whoever comes to my front door.I then noticed I had the ‘delivered successfully, handed to resident’ notification. This was obviously a flat out lie or mistake as a delivery driver hadn’t even been on my street, let alone delivered it to me by hand. Tried to speak to Amazon straight away but they have the cheek to advise ‘ask all of your neighbours, look around the outside of your house and wait 24 hours before you contact us’. This may be right in some cases but not when a driver has blatantly lied. I spoke to an associate, the first one wasn’t very helpful at all and said that the delivery could still be delivered up to next tuesday even though it was literally out for delivery and apparently handed to me. I find it ridiculous that they claim to have no way of contacting the driver that had the parcel to ask them what’s gone wrong. I have no idea what’s happened to my parcel, has it been delivered to a completely different person on another street? Still in the van and driver just lied about delivering it? Gotten mysteriously lost? To be fair, the second associate was helpful in that she gave me a full refund straight away but I was gutted as I really wanted the item and had bought it on special offer which has now ended.Amazon need to introduce a feature where they take photos upon delivering because I would love to know what’s happened here. I don’t think I’ll be ordering anything off there any time soon or if at all after this.",0

"Total RIP OFF Don't trust them at all i tried purchasing 10 of each 3 items on prime day and twice my order was cancelled without any reason, rang customer service they as well don't know what is happening.

"Avoid this sh!!ty store. I bought giftcards 2 times, both times my account got suspended ""due to suspicious activity"" and I had to call 3 times and wait over 3 days until my account got reopened. Second time I ordered EXACT same thing happened. I have dual layer security on my account and everything at hand, still my account is ""suspicious"" and your order and account gets on hold at any moment they feel like it. No customer service can help you, the ONLY way is to fill out a form through the website and SCAN multiple documents from the bank and older payments to ""ensure you are the owner of the account"" . Words can't describe the idiotic level on this store and service.",0
Always uses USPS even after reporting that we were having issues with them. Packages always lost cos they leave them a block away from our house.,1
"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was fine timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer assistance, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your assistance is no longer acceptable.",1
"Horrible customer service. I used the live chat feature to resolve an issue and explained the issue in my chat. The rep on the chat then asked me 3 different times to explain the issue even though I clearly wrote out each problem. Then had me change the passowrd to the business account and logged off and we never finished the process. Now I'm locked out of my account. I called a customer rep number and because I couldnt log into the account I couldnt tell her the exact billing address of the account, so she said, there's nothing we can do to help. I'm completely in shock, my business account password was requested to be changed by Amazon, then failed to complete the process, then another Amazon rep simply said there is nothing we can do. So now I have 200 employees locked out of the business account and Amazon ""can't do anything about it""It gets even better - I asked to be transferred to the Amazon Business customer service and the rep said they won't accept your call because you don't have the exact billing address for them, which is in the account but I'm locked out. It's 2 hours of dealing with Amazon and all I want to do is log into my account, seems simple enough for Amazon but they can't do it.",0
"I paid £349 for an Apple series 9 watch when I received the package imagine my surprised when I opened it to find a book and two blind spots mirrors that are worth 2% of the price of what I paid for the Apple Watch. I contacted Amazon customer service straight away since then it’s been a nightmare to get any sort of help, all the employees I have spoken to have been anything but helpful all of them kept telling me different information and lying to cover themselves and the company up whilst essentially refusing to process my refund. To make matters worse i have provided prove that I was sent the wrong item it is clear the package its self that I was sent weighs way more then the apple watch, the Apple Watch that I bought official weight is 31.9 grams whilst the package I was sent weigh 0.34kg or 340 grams to be precise. Be care Amazon is no longer what it use to be it is now full of dishonest employees and thieves looking to steal your hard earn packages for their own profitable gains. ",0
This is my 'go to' website- first stop Amazon!,2
"Amazon disguised it's philanthropy through unwanted marketing. Amazon has a program called amazon smile, where part of your purchase can be donated to a charity of your choice if you opt into the program. However, Amazon only allows you to participate in donating to these charities if you have your notifications turned on, which allows Amazon to send marketing messages--a suggestive sales technique. If you turn off notifications, amazon turns off your ability to donate part of your purchase to charities.",0
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
Items are shipped amazingly fast.,2
"Ive been an amzon.ca customer since 2015 when they were new and just finding a place on the map.  Back then they really cared about their customers and stepped up their customer service and care to a whole new level.Much like most companies they forget about who made them big (the consumers) and their service fell by the waste side.Its now a company thats gotten to big for its britches and cares very little if your happy with their service or not.I pay prime fees and my parcels are well past their delivery time at the best of times.My son tried amazon, he said never again!..reason my mothers day order was placed well in advance, the day it was suppose to arrive it was canceled as product was damaged (4 items) his money was refunded but that provided him little comfort as mothers day was in two days in a lock down.  They blamed it on the seller and offered NOTHING for his inconvenience not even to expedite the same things.They are never accountable for things that go wrong and never try to rectify it anymore...this leaves a bad taste in my mouth! I use to rave about them...not so much anymore.  I myself keep looking for the next amazing company that cares for its consumers ...mean while i have started shopping more locally and doing curb side to try and eliminate my frustration with amazon.",0

"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music support, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new support at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new support at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
Fed up  waiting  in for delivery  the drivers sometimes  doesn't   knock just but card thought  your door  and just run off. The only  time I would  given Amazon 10 out 10 is for there lockers. Unfortunately they don't  have these  in Madeira. What a shame.,2
This company is awesome. Delivered fast and without poblems to a cheap price always!,2
Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.,1
"I've rarely had issues with Amazon prior to this, but I have cancelled my prime membership and closing out my Amazon credit card account and I will NEVER use Amazon again. After realizing I needed a cable to connect to a conference at 10am the next morning, I purchased this item specifically because it had next morning delivery, even adding two other items I did not need to be above the $25 threshold for the 4am-8am delivery. I woke up at 6 because I didn't want the package sitting out front after sunrise only to find the item hadn't shipped yet. After waiting until 9am, only because the order had changed to 'preparing to ship' before I raced to Walmart and purchased the item. Later, the order delivery time changed to between 5pm & 10pm, so I used the Amazon assistant to cancel the order, but received a message saying that it might be too late to cancel. Shortly after I got an email saying it was too late to cancel. I then used the messaging system and after initially being told the same thing by 2 employees, I was put in touch with a supervisor who told me he contacted the warehouse to cancel order. A short time later I saw that the item now showed 'shipped' but still had delivery window of 5p to 10pm. This time I requested a call back, and after wasting approximately 45 minutes trying to explain that because it had not arrived in the promised timeframe, I was forced to purchase it already and since I had only purchased it because of early morning delivery, even adding items I did not need to be eligible, asking for order to be cancelled was not an unreasonable request. The two employees and 'supervisor' I spoke with were not helpful and even rude, telling me the item had shipped (but wouldn't arrive for another 5-9 hours), they could not cancel order. I know for a fact that they can contact drivers because of a previous missed delivery where they contacted driver to complete delivery the same night. But all attempts to cancel this order were denied, telling me I would either have to track the order and be out front when truck arrived to refuse delivery or waste my time to return item. The order was delivered at 7pm, I tried tracking, checking about every 5 minutes, but somehow after seeing 6 deliveries before mine, when I next checked back it showed delivered. I was not asking for anything outrageous, they failed to meet the promised delivery window, which is THE ONLY REASON I MADE PURCHASE, even adding two items for my dog in order to get order above $25, this shouldn't have been an issue. I'm finished with Amazon, if they fail to respect or appreciate their customers, I will take my business elsewhere.",0

"I was happy until they switched over to this Amazon Logistics bull crap with 3rd party carries instead of using USPS. Gifts I ordered for shipment to family in a different state was left on side apartment door vs. in the lobby. Did not ring my mother's apartment to let her know they were there other times. Yesterday I was expecting a package, it shows delivered and I was fed some excuse by the customer support rep that some ""new drivers"" may be scanning packages of delivered before they are. While this may be a chance due to the holiday season, I am giving them today for the package to show. If it does not, I will be asking for a refund or for the item to be re-sent.",1

They act like all they want to do is just get in and out of the building as quick as possible.  They can't compare with FedEx, UPS or even USPS delivery service.",0

The movies and TV shows they offer to NZ customers are better than Netflix NZ, but it is impossible to watch 'em. Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ. It's just impossible to use Amazon Prime in NZ. Cancelled the subscription. Back to the more-or-less-crappy alternatives, we have here.",1

The shipment hours aren't guaranteed anymore you order early for 6 - 10pm shipment check back Amazon has changed day & time to when you aren't home. Ordered also for Sat 1pm shipment all 5 items lost in transit. I have to wait 5 - 7 days for money back when Amazon never dispatched items.,1

"Terrible speed on shipping!  I ordered my product from Valuenetpc  Inc on the Amazon website.  Valuenetpc  Inc didn't ship my product until December 5th. I ordered on December 3rd, 2019.

They gave me free over night shipping and sure enough it was the very next day I received both my Best Buy items.  Best Buy I'll order from again.  When I initially wrote this review I didn't realize the shipper was Valuenetpc  Inc.  Just think before you order from Valuenetpc  Inc.  I hope this review helps others.

"Ive always found Amazon delivery drivers to be very good at their job.This time however I’m not only annoyed about the delivery service but Amazon customer services itself.I ordered some new garden furniture, the lorry pulled up as I was taking my dog for a walk around the block.I let my partner know they were here and I set off, but as I turned the corner to come home the delivery driver was reversing his truck leaving my Partner to take this extremely large extremely heavy parcel which the driver dumped on the pavement leaving it  for my partner who is classed as disabled to struggle moving it up the pathway 😡.I was fuming, I reported it to Amazon who on the phone apologised and told me they would look into it, all of this is recorded on my door cam but do you think I have heard a word back 🧐 not a bloody word.Oh and if you think that was bad the next day I was expecting a delivery where the delivery woman opens my front door and throws the parcel in shuts the door then runs off up the road once again caught on camera, once again I was put on hold waiting to speak to another person to then have the call cut off from their end.

Customer service is based in India. Chat person often disappears and is replaced by new agent mid chat.If you want a replacement for damaged goods you have to contact chat as phone never connects.

I have to sort out a return rather than just binning and getting a replacement.Dismally atrocious lack of customer aftercare.,0
I've had a refund in limbo for a macbook pro for a month and support has been useless and even hung up on me after refusing to tell me their full name.  It should be illegal to hold on to such a large amount of money for so long.  I still have no idea when or if my refund is going to be processed.

"I really love the item range at Amazon.com However, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD) If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me. Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of support from Amazon.",1

I got a plain PS4 model, not the Death Stranding LE.Adding to the insult, their custom,er service does not even speak English and I had to use google translate in order to able to communicate with them.Simply awful.

They further compound their evil behavior by offering ""Free Delivery"" in the item listing but making it impossible to access this option during the purchase process. This disrespect and abuse of their customer's trust and goodwill surely must be rewarded by a mass exodus of customers to more honest and reliable retailers.

One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the items or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' usages. Typical corporate America. No matter how many fine things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
After a friend raised the appraisal of Amazon a lot i decided to make my first purchase with them which was successful but the second had some little issues which they later resolved after i spammed them with a lot of messages.,1
"Customer service people just lie to get you to leave the chat. They say that they have escalated the issue but that's just BS, my issue has never been resolved. One guy even said that he'd give me a voucher to compensate me but that never happened of course!!!",0
Sick of this company now! Items don't turn up or they arrive open with parts of my order missing and there excuse is they want me to file a police report for their negligence! The people they hire to deliver items don't even knock or anything they dump your packages on the main road or outside where ppl can get them. 🤔 Will not be using this service no more as iv lost 60 quid with them. Go elsewhere.,0
It’s sad when you constantly spend your hard earned money on Amazon and when it’s there turn to fix the issue that you are having they make you feel like your being questioned by the fbi i think after the holidays I’m going to cancel my Amazon account and go over to Temu,0
"I have only had 1 order thats been late and still is, masks from china LOL..Every other order has been bang on time or a day early... Professional service",2
Very good and useful site,2
"I never have any issues with Amazon. I am a Prime member. Not only do they have literally everything you need, but with Prime, things come in so fast! Even when I didn't have Prime, things arrived in a reasonable time. Unbelievable prices compared to going to a store.",2
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the goodss supplied. It's Amazons own order assistance that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1
Since Amazon started utilizing 3rd party delivery services one thing is guaranteed your order will be late. ,0
Always great customer service,2
"I'm writing this review for reseller and amazon. So before I start, 5 for seller, 3 for Amazon. The thing is, Amazon mostly provides space to sell your items. So 3 because I was disappointed about amazons customer service.",2
Drivers kept leaving my parcel on door step whiles not at home and without me requesting a safe place alot of my parcels got stolen due to their drivers fault and instead of investigating they blocked my account permanently and blamed it on too many refunds instead of their drivers,0
I had a broken xbox controller pad I had prime so I got a new one the next day payed 103  they sent me a faulty pad ...I'm waiting 30 days for a refund from this day on I'm never buying anything from amazon ever again .... they received the product it then took them 6 days to process the refund that time is absolutely disgusting to hold on to 100 pounds worth of my money for that long ..,0
Paid for prime to get 2 day shipping and item wasn’t received in 2 days! I was told by customer service to give it 4 days! Why give an option for 2 day shipping if it can’t be upheld! So everyone be aware the 2 day shipping is not guaranteed....it’s just a “suggested” time for delivery according to customer service. I will not order from amazon and this is my first order placed! It’s scam with the prime “2 day” special shipping,0
Romanian drivers always steal from my parcel,0
Free shipping is acceptable,1
"I have brought lots of things from Amazon and I do love the company, however I ordered something so exciting in about March time and it never ever turned up, I got an email saying they had received the order but it never turned up, need my money back 😩",1
"Rubbish pathetic wrapping material.I bought a Paper Mache bird with hearts attached and Amazon decided to post it to me in a Cardboard Stiff Envelope?No wrapping around the object to cushion it, nothing.",1
"I didn't know how bad Amazon was until I had to return something on 11/03/2020. I never even thought to search for bad reviews but now I am amazed at how many bad reviews Amazon.com has! Amazon is turning into a garbage company especially after dealing with customer service. This whole idea how Amazon puts the customer first is absolute nonsense. After this experience its much safer to buy things from retail stores. If you don’t like something its an easy no hassle return. Don't waste literally a day trying to return packages to a UPS shipping center and then being insulted by an Amazon customer service rep. I had to return some gym equipment it was a bit large and heavy but it turned out to be an absolute nightmare! First the seller was price gouging which Amazon allows. Don’t be fooled with yoyo prices on Amazon they allow sellers to take advantage of people during a pandemic. Be careful with Amazon pricing. Second I just didn’t want the equipment it was too large for my space. To make things worse customer service yelled at me on the phone. I am not kidding this women actually told me that Amazon takes no responsibility for the sale if its from a third party then instead of helping me figure out how to return the items she hangs up on me! I am not kidding she didn’t finish helping me and hung up the phone on me because I was asking them to please make returning large items more easy. I didn't even know it was from a third party until I tried to return it and I was having some problems with how or where to return the items. I was treated like a fool, insulted by their customer service and they never even resolved the problem! I used to buy a lot from Amazon but we are now reconsidering everything we buy from Amazon for several reasons. Amazon will NOT help the customer with return problems. Amazon prices are all over the place. They have no consistency for pricing its like trying to buy something with Bitcoin one day its selling for half the next day its up 100%. I will only be made a fool one time. I know I am just one little tiny voice in a company who has taken over the United States but I know for sure if their customer service acted like this to me they are doing it to others. With this kind of behavior some day some online retailer will catch on and make online shopping a much better experience. Don’t even try to have Amazon customer service call you unless you are ready to be insulted and don't order anything that cannot be returned at the UPS Store. I am just warning others before they waste a day and get insulted. Minus 100 stars for Amazon.",0
"Constant bait and switch on Amazon fresh. They figure out what items you actually want, refuse to let you actually buy them, and then Jack the price by 50% to 100% when you add them back to your cart again.",0
"I had been a faithful Amazon customer since the 1990s and rarely had cause for dissatisfaction, until they started using their own couriers. Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no interaction in order. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection. Worst of all, there is no way for me to lodge a complaint except here. Now I try to order ABA: Anywhere But Amazon.",1
"Christmas Disappointment – Missing DJI Camera BundleI recently received my parcel, or so I thought. The delivery man left it on the floor and requested I enter a code on his phone. Suspicion arose when the weight felt off, and upon opening it, I discovered baby items instead of the expensive DJI camera bundle set I ordered. The disappointment prompted an immediate call to Amazon customer service, as evident in the attached photo.Despite the tracking indicating a delivery on my street for five hours on 21.12.23, the package mysteriously arrived on 22.12.23. During the redelivery, the delivery person, with limited English proficiency, placed the parcel on the floor and asked me to enter a code on his phone—raising further concerns about the legitimacy of the process.The evident scan became apparent when I noticed the packaging opened too easily, contrary to Amazon's usual tamper-proof measures. This ordeal is especially disheartening as I cannot have children, and the unexpected delivery of baby items shattered my Christmas spirit. The mix-up not only ruined the holiday but also raised questions about the security of Amazon's delivery system. I hope for a swift resolution to rectify this unfortunate situation.",0
"The ordering usage is always decent, but don't try and call customer support. The people are very hard to understand, theres so much noise in the background you cant hear anything and they put you through hoops to check on your own damn account. ITS RIDICULOUS!!",1
"This company is going to crash and simmer out of existence. The people who work there are lazy and jealous of the former CEO. These people are greedy and feel entitled to have what they see others having, even though they lack the brains and ingenuity to even come close to having that kind of success. So these Customer Service clowns, whom are predominantly f**oreign, have no care to provide any type of good service. 90 percent of the time they will hang up on you after you ask a simple question. This is a problem of s**tupid American companies who choose to hire humans who h***ate us to handle our company profiles. Keep the Customer Service Representatives in America. Otherwise you get people who intentionally run down the company.",0
"Awaiting deliveries today got my time slot of 12-2pm Amazon van came and parked outside. No one came to the door. Thought must be trying to find my parcels. Next thing drives off and my orders are updated with ""attempt made to deliver"" and will re-schedule for next day. Checked my Ring Doorbell cam and driver never got out of his van and drove off. Was an Amazon marked van too not one of their delivery agents. Amazon need to get there house in order they cant keep treating customers like this.",0
"1. No place to leave feed back for Amazon, just for products and sellers. 2. Your search engine (i use that term lightly) has become so difficult to refine it is unusable. I get that you want to sell us stuff we don't need or want. But hey, what about the stuff we do want? I just attempted to purchase an Iphone on amazon and I couldn't find it. I couldn't  refine by just the phones, Apple was not a choice for brand, and of course no price limits. Do you really think I'm going to go through thousands of items i don't want just to find what i'm looking for? who has that kind of time? I'm just going to Apple directly, i'd rather pay more and get what I want.",0
Always easy to deal with. Any issues with orders are always dealt with same day.Cheapest prices and 99% of the time it’s in stock.,2
"Ordered an item and they said delivered to a resident. Husband knocked every door in our street.......nowhere to be found.Contacted amazon, which is a nightmare trying to do.....the automated responses said would deliver today, site showed delivered to a neighbour in no 4, it was not. Went back on to amazon.....automated again, that said a mistake and will be delivered in 3 days.....absolutely shocking and unbelievable, and very frustrating.Amazon you are worse than useless",0
"I'd give no stars if that was possible. When you get ripped off by one of their sellers, they don't stand by you. They give you the run around with their claim filing that never amounts to anything. They admit they owe you the money but never credit you. They keep trying to give me a lousy $5 credit to purchase something from their own company. All that means is you now need to spend more money instead of getting your full refund after returning the item.",0
The customer service is always AMAZING!!! So helpful and friendly and resolves any situation. I shop a lot with Amazon and this is the reason why. Makes a huge difference and the experience much more pleasurable than other companies.,2
I won’t be using Amazon anymore either. Going to be deleting my account of over 10 years. Their customer service is terrible and they charged me early for a return. As I’m a truck driver I can’t always send something at my home right away and it said I had more time than what they gave me. I have screenshots even offered to send to them. Told them to keep the money from the defective item I need to send. It was the principle of how they’re doing businessI’ll stick with Walmart . online.,0
"Someone ordered on my account, 28 water balloons and 11 floor scrubbers and had them sent to my address, but I declined the delivery as I did NOT order these items. I had to cancel my credit card due to this! It had to be an Amazon employee, as no one else had access to my information. Maybe someone thought it would be funny, it was not!",0
Terrible!! Was due a delivery with prime a week ago. The morning of delivery my account orders changed to undeliverable as damaged in transit and a refund will be given. One item from the package was returned the next day and I got a refund but 3 items are ‘missing’ and now I have to wait 14 days for a refund! Customer service is not acceptable and been told different things. First to wait to the 30th then the 11th august. Was told someone would contact me within 24hrs but they never did! It’s beyond a joke. Quick enough to take the money! Last person I spoke to said they can see its transit and will issue a refund after the 11th. Why? Why can’t they give me refund if they know it’s being sent back ! Personally I think one of the drivers has stolen my items! How does one item return back to Amazon the next day but the other 3 items haven’t almost a week one! It’s ridiculous.,0
"Have had the same address and delivery instructions for over 20 years! In the last year I have contacted Amazon no less than 100 times about the same issue… Drivers either leaving packages on the pavement in plain view or not bothering to turn up at all and saying they attempted delivery. Instructions are always to leave in designated “safe place” so there is never a reason for a failed delivery. Sick of hearing pat customer service responses from people that are not equipped to actually deal with the issue or capable of deviating from pre-scripted procedures. Told every time they “understand” and “this is not the level of service we expect Amazon customers to receive” and “I will definitely ensure this never happens again.”…. A year! Over 100 phone calls, innumerable online chats and still…. The issue of ridiculously bad delivery, missing packages, dishonest drivers and poor customer services continues.",0
I recently purchased wall posters from Amazon. Good price and stuff got delivered in 3 days. Great website to buy almost anything.,2
"We are Prime members and have received good service from Amazon over many years,,,,,,Until we decided to use their Morrisons food delivery. We placed order with Amazon on sat 4th Dec 2021 and we were informed of the same day delivery which we did not need so said that Sunday the 5th would be acceptable.We were allocated 2.00pm to 4.00pm delivery slot.We were informed it was out for delivery at 2.10pm.We were then informed at 4.00pm that the order was cancelled.We would have accepted a late delivery as we had waited in already.I am suspicious that if someone had picked it in the store and loaded it on a vehicle, why not deliver it a bit late. Did they actually pick it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am sorry to say that we will never shop in Morrisons again as we have sometimes in the past and it does put Amazon in a bad light.I think Amazon needs to move away from Morrisons....That food was for our evening meal which created a problem,,,,,",0
think 'we' should post a review based on our experiences over time (ANY THING ELSE IS JUST NOT FAIR).......,2
"Very bad application , they never bring you the orders and they don’t give you refund never am very disappointed from Amazon I never buy more anything from there ",0
This a bit difficult to write a review as Amazon have many different components on its site I've ordered many things from them some of them fantastic others never again the really two big problems I have is when you ask them not to leave on door steps they do and dont put through letter box as dog will eat it and as the person who is delivering doesn't know what's in the parcel it could be harmful to the animal send I know you need to be over 18 to order and  show you are over  that age but am well over that age but they whould not leave it how stupid,1
"If you plan to buy anything from AMAZON... make sure that it is NOT coming from a 3rd party seller thru AMAZON! You could end up in a loop to loop bounce around of who is at fault IF your purchase does not show up. And if it ships USPS, well that is added I do not know to the issue because USPS can never give you a true meaningful day & time. All this happened to me beginning on 4/16/24.",0
"Amazon became thief,cheater last months. I ordered an item. Items price was 256.97, shipping 20.68 and i applied my promotional balance ,which amazon gave me for defective item.Amazon cancelled my order. I sent my id documentation.it granted.i couldnplace a new order.but this time items price was 338 usd and my promotinal balance disappeared. Cancellation was for straling my balance and change items price. Chat assistants just know to  ignore you any issues. (Order number - 113-5943403-5629833)",0
"Amazon keeps getting worse and worse! I’ve contacted them 11 times (only counting in the mails contacts) now regarding the same issue. I have items continuously claiming to be ‘on their way’ but nothing happens. No one is helping me getting a return or merely calling me. I just keep writing and writing! It’s turning into a scam company, holding your money, but no delivery of any packages.",0

"The Amazon Company has not met it's responsibility to it's customers. Many of it's goodss, that used to be delivered in just two days are taking weeks. When you pay an annual fee, you expect promises to be kept!Amazon is also led by an ultra liberal person. It's offering and management of employees reflect that. It sheds a negative aspect of it's very existence!",1

"On 12/6/2019 a package from Amazon was being delivered. The UPS guy had a smart idea to drive on the lawn. Well he tired to drive on the lawn and was stuck until a tow truck had to pull him out. I went out and got numerous “Please do not drive on grass” signs. Then yesterday (3 weeks later) we were expecting a package from Amazon. This package was being delivered by Amazon and what do they do? They drive on the grass and get stuck and waited 3 hrs for a tow truck but this is before they damaged my lawn some more. The 1st incident occurred on 12/31/2018, an Amazon driver in a white van also drove on the lawn and got stuck causing major lawn damage!  So do Amazon drivers know how to read? I highly doubt it!",0
"I would give it 0 stars if possible. I paid for prime. Not 1 package came after i upgraded. ""Running late"" Shipment lost"". Then you just take it.

If I could I wouldn’t give them one star. I ordered an item that amazon swore it would ship within two days( we are now on day 14 and still the item hasn’t shipped. Was chatting with customer service and they disconnected with me!! That’s it I’m done!! From now on I will buy from eBay!,0
ordered a stapler and it was supposed to come with a set of staples - the stapler arrived without the staples so not much use really,1
amazon is a fine platform for B2b bussines.,1

"The worst customer service because there are no customer service. The company has a good range of products and prices are okay but yesterday I added a new debit card and spent $3,000 on a new laptop.

"in general they do pretty well.   god help you if you want to leave feedback about them or their site.    their annoying gdamned app will message me all day long every few minutes about deals or hey do you wanna buy, or an order that I placed is going through step 500 of the 1000 things they'll tell me about, but they can't be bothered to tell me when/why an order I was looking for was cancelled or otherwise marked 'undeliverable'.   and trying to be able to talk to a person about this issue, or let them know that I think this is a problem?

"I had been a customer of Amazon for sometime..I purchased a lot of stuff like house hold items to shampoo/conditioner..I even purchased stuff for our new addition  like pictures  hand towel holder and clocks..Well, I ended up changing my mind and I return a few items..When returning these items I had no idea that crap was about to hit..My account had been hacked, and I notified Amazon about my account I've been hacked so they go in and they lock my accounts and I think nothing of it a few days passes and still my account is locked and I'm not able to reorder or you know do anything so I call customer service they said they would relate it and take care of it and I would receive a phone call, few days later my account was still locked. I called and I found out that they supposedly had sent me an email from Amazon telling me that they had close my account permanently and that I can no longer be a customer .because The email stated I had requested too many refunds, and  the second email stated that I had returned too many items due to their policy requirement that your limit on how many stuff you're allowed to return..I never once received any letter  through the mail letting me know what was going on my with my ordering history, instead amazon took it upon herself to go ahead and permanently close my account...I was Informed by an email and never at one time had I received a phone call from freaky amazon regarding my account...In my email I was informed that since they looked at my ordering history and my account had been closed, I was never allowed to open another account with Amazon and neither was my family members that I lived with..I can't understand how Amazon can close my account because I RETURNED TOO MANY ITEMS, AND REQUESTED TO MANY REFUNDS!!!! Walmart allows you to buy and return without totally banning you from there stores...So. as warnings do not be a customer of freaking Amazon",0

I had signed up a couple weeks ago for a free trial of their Prime membership and while I liked it, I don't think I'd use it or its services enough to justify the cost so I had planned on cancelling it before my trial ran out... but I forgot to cancel in time! I noticed the charge to my bank account and called Amazon that day to say i didn't want the service and wanted a refund; I expected to have a huge fight about it but lo and behold, the first customer service rep I talked to took care of the charge right away as soon as I had explained my issue! No fuss and no fighting! That's the way a company with any sort of membership plans should be ran. A+ work Amazon!",2
I have had several interactions between sellers not actually Amazon on your site and have been totally amased at Amazon's immediate response in correcting the issue your ratings only go to 5 stars in my dealings with Amazon I would most certainly rate your service at 10 stars twice what is able to rate you at thank you so much for being above and beyond what any person could ever expect,2

"I appreciate the scale of what Amazon has achieved, and understand that it has single handedly within a period of only a few years turned the human race into an over-expectant, self-centered and impatient lot, but the fact that there is no way at all to speak to someone in customer service to simply ask why a late delivery has been marked as failed delivery without any attempt to deliver it is just beyond frustrating! Like most people, we have become reliant on Amazon for their super quick deliveries of last minute items. Sadly, we now seem to have little to no option to go elsewhere.....",0
fine. swift order also,1
I placed a LARGE order through amazon and many items were considered undeliverable to the address and were returned by USPS. However that was on the 23rd of JUNE! I am now in JULY and still no refund has come across. I spoke with AMAZON and no person will give me a refund for the items I did not receive. It is crazy that they have no problem taking your 1k amount for the items you ordered but when it comes to getting a refund for the undeliverable items they will not give it.

"I bought an Echo Alexa speaker. It’s great for playing all kinds of audio. I am using it for radio, music and audio books currently. The voice recognition is fine. Size and style fine. I was however very disappointed to discover that it has no internal battery so it’s not portable. This limits my use to one room. If I had realised this (I should have read the spec but just naturally assumed that a speaker would have a rechargeable internal battery) I would not have bought it.",1

Not even worth one star i set up Amazon to order some stuff for my new house £600 ordered then they send me a message to say account is on hold im guessing as i paid on my credit card in my maiden name so cancelled my order and not sent the money straight back now moving in without a bed for my daughter and customer care call was rubbish not even a manager to speak to i should have stuck to Ebay never lets you down unlike this.,0

I am literally on the phone every week with Amazon customer service because one thing or another didn't get delivered or it was delivered to the wrong place or it's being held at US post office service. Whenever I call weekly by the way I get the most ignorant clearly non-educated people answering the call who don't know how to do anything but say oh I'm sorry oh I'm so sorry I swear to goodness if one more Amazon person says I'm sorry to me I am going to lose my cool! I ordered pillows in June they never arrived they sent me new pillows which said were delivered but when you looked at the tracking the carrier just picked them up and that was the end of the tracking. So of course I had to do all the work I have to cancel the order I have to reorder them at a more expensive price because it's now been 2 months in the price is gone up I swear to God I am so flipping sick of Amazon and they're terrible policies and the fact that they really don't give a crap about whether you get your stuff or not. The policies they have in place are just ridiculous people are stealing my stuff so I have to cancel my order and reorder it again and they're stealing my stuff by not delivering it to me so it's not like somebody stealing it off my mailbox no it's never getting delivered half the time honestly I would not join Amazon and I think I'm going to cancel my whole thing because I'm sick of it I'd rather go to stores and wait at least then I get what I want and I don't have people lying to me I cannot stand when people lie and I think that's how they train their customer service just lie to them just lie to them it'll be fine go ahead and lie and say you're sorry eventually they'll be worn down and they'll do whatever you want. You know it would be different if they actually needed individual customers I feel like but they don't so they don't give a crap,0

"Good company.lots of goodss.but would be better if they offered repeat customers a deal/break/discount.... i know people who have spent thousands of dollars and have not even been acknowledged....I just read that Amazon is approaching the ""trillion"" dollar mark in revenue.it's time to share the wealth people!!!!",1
"Always have a great shopping experience with Amazon, any problems always returned and had refund, purchased 100’s of items from them over the years, always fab…",2

"They have reliable drivers masked by rude, and drivers that totally dis respect me as a customer. Throwing parcels over or by back gate saying handed to me in person. Yesterday had message saying parcel delivered to my safe place. Not there. Told to knock at doors to find it.",1

"Amazon is frequently a lifesaver, delivering what you need as soon as you need it. I leave in two weeks for the trip of a lifetime, backpacking in Cambodia and Laos. I'm a professional photographer sometimes, and it was time to upgrade to include a professional camera drone. The inexpensive EXO Cinemaster II sounded like a great deal, but CAREFULLY reading Amazon reviews, I concluded it was a well-marketed drone, but NOT a great drone. The DJI Mini had many more reviews, almost all positive, so at spme extra expense I went with the DJI. I don't want to give more money to Jeff Bezos, but Amazon -even if you hate it- has its upsides, especially on product reviews and on the sale of unusual items. So, use it when needed, shop local when you have the option.",2
I spoke to Jamaica today because my delivery went to the wrong address. Was a very professional agent in sorting my issues and assuring me when we will receive our item. So good to see agents working through these hard time and dealing with customers at the best of their abilities. This has made me a very happy customer of Amazon.,2
"Amazon always comes through for all my shopping needs and I mean ALL! I would have given them 5 stars and almost gave them 1 star for one very unfortunate reason... LASERSHIP!! I've called and complained that the MUST stop using them for deliveries. UPS, USPS and FEDEX all work! Anytime they use Lasership my packages arrive as late as 2 weeks if at all (and I'm paying for Prime) OR they arrive opened and clearly ""handled""! They don't even have the decency to wrap things up properly again just shoving it into the box and delivering packages clearly ransacked! I don't know how LASERSHIP stays in business. I've given Lasership a bad review as well but its Amazon that needs to stop using them!",0
Bought an ipad charger from amazon.. turns out its was a fake. Amazon has far too many counterfiet sellers now and doesnt seem to want to do anything about it. Will never buy from amazon again,0
"Ordered PlayStation Portal cost £199. Parcel arrived with a totally different item, informed Amazon straight away and returned incorrect item. Had an illegal transaction from Amazon weeks later they took another £199 from my account for the PS Portal that was NEVER RECEIVED!

"My review is little bit different. I used amazon as a store and it is great. But my review is about their cloud service. I just wanna say that the Amazon is the best in every sphere. They have virtual servers,  virtual, private clouds.",2
I can say I’ve never had a problem with amazon  they’re great👍😀they’re life savers,2
I wish I could say ZERO!!  Amazon delivered my package to the wrong house and customer service had the nerve to get an attitude with me!!  Rep named Lexi had the nerve to say be careful how I speak to her via Chat!!  I will be calling the corporate office Monday!!  My package was over $200 and the pic even shows the wrong house number!!!  Horrible!!,0
"It was a time when Amazon was a really decent company,  but now it seems to be just another one just like the other. One of my problems I have with them is their order.  I'm a prime member and have been for years but now that doesn't matter to Amazon.  We order often and our home sits slightly up off of the street in a cul de sac and we have the ring and it shows them delivering. I have called, complained and also written instructions with orders and on the account not to walk in the yard on the grass but only walk on the driveway. Well no one cares and they park at the driveway and walk straight through our yard which is well taken care of. Years back they never did this and they have no respect for the customers property.  I will be canceling my prime and shop for what I need elsewhere. ",1
Have been purchasing from Amazon for years I've bought many wonderful products. I'll always give 5 star reviews made one negative review about a bogus product was absolutely misrepresented.. Now Amazon has removed all of my reviews throughout the history of my purchases and I am no longer allowed to review any products. How. How is the customer supposed to make an educated choice on a product if the negative reviews are removed,0
"Constant brush off emails.  Anytime you complain they just tell you they are ""investigating"" and never do anything.  Also CS can't do anything other than refunds.  So the sellers bribe the Amazon Community managers to alter reviews,  and there is no way to report the transgressions.  Any attempts to contact are either fumbled by incompetent (and powerless CS),  or outright blocked by corrupt Amazon Community managers.",0
"simply great, no more ebay.",2

"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer assistance at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1

Amazon is a rip off . Today they took 12.99 put of my account without my authorization for a membership trial that's not over until may. I called to speak to a customer service rep who stated he was gonna submit a refund in 3 days I got upset because u inconvenience me now I have to wait to get my money back that is not good enough . I ask to speak to a supervisor he tells me no you can't speak to my supervisor and began laughing on the phone saying he not letting me speak to anyone over 12.99 and hung up the phone . I'm sure I'm not the only one this happened to . class action is on its way .  you will not take my money when u feel like it and tell me to wait 3 busjness days and hang up that's totally unprofessional,0
"Multiple Issues:1. Chronically late and sometimes lost shipments due to trusting the USPS.2. Recently attempted to read a book I had bought months before- The last and critical page were missing.

"One star because of no choice:1: Lost items in mail for 2 weeks, ordered on July 11th and offered a refund on July 20th it  becomes an Amazon customer initiated refund after Amazon said to refund it and NOW you have to wait on them AFTER THEY said to get refund today. ITS  28th and NO refund.2: Purchased an expensive watch from a bogus store ON Amazon. Returned delivered item 20 minutes after delivery, like the above products mentioned no refund YET only an INDIAN women saying get in line and shut up and wait, like she said we take money in 30 seconds, refunds take 30 days. 3: I am not crazy but between ALL AMAZON REFUNDS and compounded interest Amazon makes about 2.5 million per month in compounded interest by keeping refunds for 30 days at expense of prime membership and people who don’t have e membership and a little more4: Bottom line take pictures of Refund types and dates the Cause for refund will change from them to you and in long term you could be held responsible.

Amazon  customer care number 8247721430 goods related quairy . I have only used amazon prime vendors and have had absolutely no issues. Amazon has always shipped on time and had an easy no hassles return policy if a goods was defective. I can’t say the same for other vendors such as Best Buy or Walmart.,1
"I am no longer able to write reviews on any of their items or use the chat for help.  Have to call Amazon (1-800-275-2273) every time I need help with something or have an issue.They said I went against one of their policies but will not let me know what they are talking about, just send a generic e-mail. Cannot talk to anyone in that department also to find out why.We are prime time members been buying books from them for my kindle since they started, we order a lot of items from them, as easier than going to several stores to look for a certain item.

Everything I ordered these last few weeks has been delivered exactly when they said they would.Absolutely fantastic delivery. Wish other online sellers were as efficient as Amazon. Merry Christmas,2
Dreadful delivery and customer service. Said on their tracking that item had been handed to customer. Spent hours trying to convince non English speaking staff who eventually said item was not delivered and had probably been lost at their depot. They offered a paltry £5 for inconvenience and said it will take 5 to 7 days to refund. Avoid them and shop elsewhere,0
Amazon is getting to be terrible about on time delivery. Product will sit at outgoing warehouse for 24-48 hours. Says delay in transit but has been sitting at outgoing warehouse.,0
"I'm always satisfied with the service, and the support team rocks!On 30+ purchases i've been disappointed just 2/3 times, and the problems where caused by sellers or courier",2
Easy ergonomics and filtering of items for the produckts I need. The Prime program gives me significant advantages which I constantly use. The prices are competitive and I often find bargains. All possible forms of paayment and no delays. Great!,2
"great site, buy from them all the time & use their prime subscription. Is really convenient!",2
"This has now happened twice. Bought some items via Amazon. An item breaks or is no good, so I return the item and get a refund. A few weeks later, Amazon then debits my card again for the item which has been returned! When I last phoned to kick off - I was told that the wrong return postage sticker had been attached - which is funny because guess who supplies the returns post stickers? You got it - Amazon! In other words, the excuse offered was complete B/S. Amazon staff are trying to get away with sticking through fraudulent bills/debits! Make sure you check your bank/card statements very carefully!",0
Cheap prices and prime is a be if but get charged prime fees atleast 2/3 times a month on cards I use on site so pay 3 times for it and same with Alexa music app,2
they have the best selection and prices..,2
"Amazon online shopping app is absolutely hopeless. Just because I had the audacity to change my payment details, this ridiculous website, refused to recognise my old details,  my new details, my old password, all new passwords,  and my email addresses !Awful Amazon's woeful website, is a bunch of bilge.",0
"I have been an Amazon customer for years. I order numerous products all throughout the year and their selection is PHENOMENAL. I am almost ALWAYS able to find what I need on the site. They offer brand new, refurbished/reconditioned and used products. The site is easy to navigate and has detailed, easy-to-use search options. You can save many items onto a personal wish list and also add items to your shopping cart to purchase at a later date, and you can add several shipping addresses and different payment options to your account.My most recent order included a Dolamee D5 brand Android TV box. I also ordered a wireless keyboard/mouse/remote combo to go along with it. I was under a 30-day Amazon Prime trial and so I got Free 2-day shipping on both items. (I was also able to find a HDMI to RCA/AV converter box on Amazon, since I have an older TV) All three items came within the 2-day shipping time-frame and they were packaged well. Everything worked like a charm with no problems whatsoever. Amazon always sends me reminders to review the products I purchase and I often do. In the rare case I ever need a replacement or refund, they make the process as simple and easy as possible. Amazon customer service is pretty good. They respond to my inquiry messages usually within 24 hours or less. The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because there have been instances where the customer service I received resulted in an unfavorable outcome. This is extremely, extremely, rare, however, and does not occur anywhere near often enough to keep me from giving the site a high rating. I plan to continue to be an Amazon customer for many years to come.",2
"I Bought a brand new remote control from them only to find that they had sent me a refurbished unit, arrived in a bag stating refurbished, I promptly sent this unit back.They kept sending me emails to review the goods and what I was led to believe their assistance. I promptly told them what I thought. surprise surprise they did not like the review and failed to add it.Tells the story of Amazon, it's alright when things are going fine.",1

"I've been shopping with amazon for over 6 years now, I think, and as for the quality of the products and packaging - there's nothing to complain about. Everything's been perfect in this respect. The site is easy to navigate and has provided 100% secure payment so far. I order a lot of books there - awesome choice, perfect quality What I don't like are high UPS express shipping rates to Russia (but they do fulfill the delivery on time or sooner, I give them that) and some regional issues, where I cannot order certain stuff even for personal use, but that's the customs issue and import policies, I guess.",2
love amazon ,1
"All these reviews are so true! All but the 5 stars. You people order one or 2 things a year. The rest of us depend a lot on amazon to save time and money. I have spent thousands since they became the pos they’ve become. Dates are not on time. Deliveries end up 6 houses down. Credits to correct their errors are never seen. I never thought I would ever see anything worse than Walmart but Amazon has completely succeeded. By the way, Amazon, it is illegal to place packages in the mailbox! If it happens again, I will report it. I found out this is a federal offense hence the US Postal Service!! People, go on Walmarts website they have something going on like Amazon and their packages actually arrive on time and in a lot of cases, you will save the same money. Yes they will make mistakes but at least you get your money back or a replacement item.",0
"Amazon Company is very good but I was tricked into Rs 2,438. I deducted payment from my credit card without buying any product and when I called customer care I asked for all the details on the mail .I was told that our team was asking for 5 days to investigate.  If you are calling later in the day, the customer care officer is saying that you have not received any mail and people are calling from this company because of how many lies.  This is not to order",0
"I unfortunately don’t have the representatives names, but I had an item never show up. I contacted the customer support for a replacement. The lady who I first talked to LIED saying she could expedite the replacement and get it to me in 2 days. After 4 days, it still never showed up and the statement on my order said Jan. 8. The lady whom I talked to after the 2nd order was placed, said they could not expedite any replacement item and was quite surprised another representative would tell me that. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon who has an interactiond representative LIE TO A CUSTOMER. However, the Second Lady who Told me they could not expedite my order was nothing but absolutely wonderful.",1

"Wasn't the greatest support I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
My most recent experience purchase no issue delivery on time. Discription size did not match on delivery posted message to seller no response left it a while WILL NOW CONTACT AMAZON SOON AS I GET CHANCE. I have left me with a sour experience as when orders are from Amazon directly there are no issues but 3rd party not so much will still shop with Amazon with a view to avoid 3rd party if possible.,2

"I had been a faithful Amazon customer since the 1990s and rarely had cause for dissatisfaction, until they started using their own couriers. Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no interaction in order. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection. Worst of all, there is no way for me to lodge a complaint except here. Now I try to order ABA: Anywhere But Amazon.",1
Have put one star back for Clarissa the only agent who cared and wanted to make things right. After id been online constant for over 4hours being palmed off to next agent she pleaded with me to stay on and she would make it right. So took 5 hours in total but she did true to her word as I found on waking up this morning so she deserves a raise but the rest of the team CS And Co can rot. And I've well and truly been put off buying other items I had intended too Awful customer assistance with foreign call centres and chat finally corrected by a Amazing clarissa as stated above after a very long time of needing help,1
Amazon has gone downhill. My last several orders have been late and I even had to cancel some. It sucks to see something that's supposedly guaranteed to be delivered by a certain time be tracked to be sitting in their distribution center 30 minutes away but still be delivered three days late. They say you're recourse is to be refunded your delivery fee but it's supposedly free with prime so your stuff is late and you no recourse. Makes me wonder if it's worth keeping my prime membership. Maybe if everybody cancelled their membership they'd get the clue and start doing better.,0
"Excellent selection of items from clothing to houshold goods. Fast delivery; some items come from overseas, but most items can arrive with a same day or overnite delivery.  Widest selection of multi-media (movies, e-books and more) that I've ever seen. I've had no issues regarding payments or refunds.  Been a customer since 2008. So far, so good.  ",2
Love Amazon. Loads of great deals and all items purchased have always been delivered without any problems at all.,2

"Amazon is Ok, but it has some problems, and there are things that I don't like about this company. One time, I ordered something on Amazon, but my account got locked up for some reason because Amazon thought something suspsious is going on. I was able to unlock it, but it was a big hassle to unlock. I also had to call Amazon Customer Service. I also don't like how you can't order with paypal. I read that Amazon workers are working very hard and get paid very little, which is why one of the reasons I try to ignore Amazon. It's a very big company though, so it should be expected. I also one day ordered an item, but it did not arrive, but Amazon helped me. Overall, Amazon is ok, but try to avoid it if you can.",1

First customer service contact person got me the feeling that everything wilm be all easy and dandy and I will get full refund. Well now after month later, talking to 10 different customer service people, I thought that I got finally my money back through promotional code (because of company police) but instead of 32$ I was suppose to get I got 30 cent. I tried to contact them once again and they just replied ""you used it already"" and I didn't even make my order I was suppose to place in.

"XPO Logistics is the worst company ever. I ordered a play house for my granddaughters on Amazon . XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the shipment provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the item somewhere else. I am not ordering anymore large items from Amazon if they are going to keep using this company. XPO Logistics  has horrible customer support!!!! Amazon has not done anything about this organization that they paired up with.",1
I ordered Onion oil in Amazon but they delivered me Argon oil.. I received 3 products same time so I didn't check the name n started using when I used for the second time only I saw it's not Onion oil n it's Argon oil.. I was shocked n checked my order in Amazon I have ordered Onion oil but they delivered a wrong product.. When I called Amazon they're saying time is over it's been 15 days now since the product is been delivered so they can't do anything.. so sending the wrong product is not a mistake but which I didn't verify is a mistake.. people please don't trust Amazon any more.. SENDING WRONG PRODUCT AND BLAMING THE CUSTOMER N ONE MORE CHECK WHETHER THE BEAUTY PRODUCTS YOU GET THROUGH AMAZON IS GENUINE. Thank You all..,0
"Avoid amazon at all costs. You will always find items cheaper elsewhere.The delivery service has changed and takes a lot longer, yet they've increased the monthly charge, they are more concerned about taking contracts elsewhere than actually providing a service for its customers. So while it's customers pay more per month, amazon takes advantage of other companies like royal mail and fills in contracts over its own customers while you continue to lay a monthly charge. The website is full of fake and dangerous items.Amazon likes to show chinese made items. Filtering the high quality Western products over the Chinese.So you buy the crap and then return to buy again.Constantly returning items that don't workCustomer service attempting to enforce amazon's policies on me haha. No amazon, the public do not follow amazon's policies. The customer support are from South Africa and don't understand british consumer rights. And they attempt to enforce rules on you. Sorry this is the UK not Africa.",0
"The delivering of packages was place directly in front of our storm door, making access to the package impossible.

If you would like me to teach all your drivers and package delivers I will be glad to do so at a modest salary.  I would expect much better from the supposed leader of the industry",0

"I am able to purchase almost everything from Amazon, great quality and quick shipping.",2
I love the fact that I can buy anything on Amazon!  They have helped me when a company sent me an inferior product that I bought through them and have allowed me to sell my own products.,2
"This is the first time when I have such experience with you, I have an ordered on 11th dec the delivery date was on 19th dec although, without delivering the product got message of successful delivery so, called customer care and asked the reason not to deliver my product she replied it was just technical glitch due to which it happened and also assured to me will be delivered till 24th dec. It's 27th dec now but, didn't receive yet. Now, My order isn't showing under the section orders have all the payment details with me if I didn't get call then I am compelled to file a case in consumer court.",0
Posted wrong review!,1
I have ordered merchandise from Amazon.com several times and also have had to request a duplicate merchandise receipt in order to validate a purchase when a product (watch) stopped running within the warranty period.  Amazon.com came thru helping me quickly.  I also believe that the books that I have ordered were purchased at a great price.,2
"Amazon is not perfect but a company that never wrong a customer at its own expense deserve great respect. Bravo Amazon, well on your way to become the most valued brand in the entire world.",2
acceptable items not happy they charge you for p&P,1
"Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their goods line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s fine name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the goodss they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!",1
"Decent website. For the most part I can find what I want with relative ease. Not all items there are the best prices, so you have to really shop around. It's not easy to get live support from them anymore. They have put blocks into place to make it harder to find a way to contact them.",1
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve goodss with so-so quality,1
I have had several deliveries not arrive or get stolen before they reach me. I even had a delivery in an amazon locker which was stolen (empty box)!Customer service always addressed these complaints. Sometimes it wasn't 100% easy as the staff they hire (offshore) can be difficult to communicate with. But they always rectified things in the end.,2

"Fifth time in a row that a preorder has been delayed or changed. Says it comes out today but won’t ship til A MONTH (actually two months) after release, but yet it tells me it’ll be here Monday. I was also lied to by CS for the $10 coupon. Was also told ticket was escalated and will be shipped in 24 hrs (I highly doubt it). They tried to deflect asking where exactly it says it’ll show up on that day when it’s RIGHT ABOVE THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF THEM! I don’t what’s going on with their preorders but it’s gotten to be god awful. I get news that other people that order at the same get theirs but yet mine gets delayed. It’s getting to when I just cancel all my orders and don’t use you all as a place holder til I find it somewhere else. They just turning into a joke of a company",0
I ordered toys for kids 5th December and I received them on 14th December. So I was happy as local stores were not able to deliver it as fast as Amazon. This helped me with Christmas,2
"The fine things about Amazon is that it is the most known and most trusted(in my opinion) website out there. It always tells you exactly where your package is.(I'm a new customer, and my orders haven't came yet) There are SOME reasonable prices like for a chain I ordered was 3 dollars. Now for the ordinary things. I've made 3 accounts to get my orders, and on all of them it says ""tHeRe WaS sUs ThInGs GoInG oN iN yOuR aCcOuNt""(it didn't look like that I'm just showing how dumb it is). I put in the correct things for the submission, but it always says ""ThAt'S nOt EnOuGh EvIdEnCe ThAt YoU oWn ThIs AcCoUnT"". Not to mention I have to wait 2 days for the same response. I've spend the last 9 days trying to get into my accounts. This is causing me a lot of stress.",1
"Amazon A big shout outI would like to thank your customer service team.  They helped me with an issue on an order that was never received.

"I placed an order a week ago for multiple items. I have not received one of the items yet. A delivery arrived two days ago for some of the items, the courier said an item was broken and insisted that he take all the items back. He said I would have a delivery the next day, nothing arrived. Now trying to get a refund for those items and still none of the other items have arrived and no emails. Don’t think I will be bothering with Amazon anymore.",0
"Richtig schlechte Suchergebnisse, scheinbar wird man hinters Licht geführt! Ich versuche schon seit geraumer Zeit Dinge bei Amazon zu finden. Ich sortiere immer nach „Preis aufsteigend“ und immer wenn ich das auswähle habe ich bei der suche nach Sneakern trotzdem ständig Socken in der Suche !? Wozu gebe ich dann extra sneaker ein? Ich hab auch auf die Kategorien gedrückt damit dies auch weiter ausgegrenzt wird wonach ich suche, vergeblich. Wenn ich spezifisch nach Markenschuhen suche dann Findet man nichtmal die Ergebnisse die einem empfohlen wurden. Also sobald man die Suchergebnisse gefiltert haben will, wirft Amazon deine suche über Bord. Achja ich bin selbst Web Developer und es liegt nicht an dem Benutzer! Amazon kann so eine Sortierung garnicht gewährleisten durch ihre Amazon SEO. Ziemlich traurig und ist ein Armutszeugnis.Really bad search results, it seems like you're being fooled! I've been trying to find things on Amazon for quite some time now. I always sort by ""price ascending"" and whenever I select that, I still have socks in the search when looking for sneakers!? Why do I enter extra sneakers then? I also pressed on the categories so that this is further excluded what I am looking for, in vain. When I search specifically for branded shoes, you can't even find the results that were recommended to you. So as soon as you want to filter the search results, Amazon throws your search overboard. Oh yes, I'm a web developer myself and it's not the user's fault! Amazon can't guarantee such sorting at all through their Amazon SEO. Quite sad and is an indictment of poverty.",0
"I ordered a patio umbrella on Aug. 1, 2021 on Amazon which I received. I have my credit card record showing the transaction. I needed to order a broken replacement part, only to discover there is no record of the purchase on Amazon itself in my order history so I contacted the company, Best Choice Products. They also had no record of my purchase. They can do nothing without my order ID number. I contacted Amazon Customer service chat online and repeatedly (3X) got what was obviously not a real person but an AI. I asked ""Are you a real person or an AI?"" and was told ""I am a real person"", but the responses were still like a programmed AI. I said, ""What is your favorite ice cream?"" because an AI would not be set up to respond. Sure enough, no answer. I wrote, ""I am not sure you are a real person so if you answer that question, I'll know."" The response: ""I am a real person"" which is the exact phrase that is always used. It's triggered by the phrase ""real person"". He refused to answer a simple question about ice cream so I knew it was an AI yet again. I finally gave up because it just kept going around in circles because its coding couldn't handle the complexity.  Shame on Amazon for lying to its customers that its customer service help are 'real people'.",0
"Amazon start sending items in the right size boxes, Penny pinching & making gifts look like they have been kept in the garage for 10 years, waited for a delivery for 8 days & I agreed to return, waited another week for replacement & it’s exactly the same, shopping online conveniences should have to include printing return labels & wasted petrol because you are penny pinching on boxes & postage 🤬",0
They don’t allow true reviews to be posted. If you had a bad experience they shut down your review. It’s pathetic that such a large corporation refuses to allow honest reviews.,0
"My wife ordered an item on from Amazon on 21 September.  On 23 September she received an email update that item was shipped.  On 26 September, online tracking said ""package expected today"" (26 Sept.).  Did not happen.  On 27 September onsite tracking says ""item may be lost"" and gave me a link to request a refund but also states item might may still be delivered but no estimate.  Very confusing.  I waited wait until end of day no delivery  so requested a refund. I clicked the refund icon. A refund did not process.  Instead, a message came up that if item is  not delivered by Tuesday (29 Sept.), I can request a refund or replacement. Still waiting-seem to be getting the runaround.  The item in question is needed to complete some Fall landscaping chores - cannot wait for ever.",0
I'm trying really hard to be fare but the more mess ups the harder it gets. Delivery of items have become hit or miss. The quality has been fairly acceptable when I do get them. My main issue is the refund process for items that I dont get delivered. It is time consuming and they are extremely picky on the way you reply. I should not have to jump through loops to get my money back. I really wish they would make it mandatory for drivers to take a pic of every shipment left. There needs to be a better way for drivers to confirm shipment address or they need to stop being lazy and actually pay attention to what address they are at.,1
Worst delivery service ever! I can order from Amazon.de and have it delivered faster than Amazon.nl and I live in NL! There is no excuse when what I order is through Amazon fulfillment center. Amazon.nl prices are also higher for the same item! Never again will I order from Amazon.nl!,0
I ordered an action camera from Amazon on Wednesday. It said One day delivery. I needed in one day or at worst two days as I purchased it to take on my honeymoon to Hawaii. It made it from TN to my state of NC overnight and showed out for delivery the next morning. I then get a message that my delivery is delayed and it will be Friday or Saturday before my package arrives. I leave Saturday morning at 7am for my honeymoon. As it stands it’s Friday night and it hasn’t showed up. I am now forced to cancel my order. I called customer support and filed a complaint. I cancelled my Prime membership (as it is obviously useless) and I will be closing my Amazon Prime Visa. For a company as big as Amazon this is unacceptable.,0
This is the best platform for me because which i order from this olatform was acceptable goods and satisfied.I realy like this platform,1
"Amazon used to be a great company but not anymore. I subscribed to several products only to be it's out of stock but there are other options which is the same product only it's literally triple the price. I canceled one of subscriptions and they not only shipped it they double shipped it and charged me for both orders. In that instance I was able to ""prove"" that I canceled well in advance of the deadline and I was refunded however the refund process is now 30 days. I shouldn't have to wait 30 days for their error. What out for the sneaky shipping fees from these Chinese companies that you may not even notice because it's in the fine print selling an item for $2 but the shipping fee is $9.99. Amazon is becoming more like Temu everyday. Sad when a company is making billions in profits but feels the need to steal from their long time customers. ",0

"I know a lot of people complain about Amazon shutting down the high street, but the high street stores have the same opportunity. If they can’t create decent websites that compete on the internet then that’s their fault, not Amazon’s.I find myself using Amazon more and more. I knocked off a star because they kind of tricked me into signing up for Prime with a misleading thing at the checkout, but I actually quite like having Prime now.",2
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day shipment and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a support provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after prices were raised and prices are higher than in stores already. Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1

"ATM Im dealing with A-Z guarantee dispute. The amazon been misleading and being dishonest with me. I have spoken to them when my phone broke and received an email confirming the A-Z guarantee has been filed. I  had to wait 2 weeks. Then after that nothing happened so I had to contact them again. I been told the A-Z guarantee was filed for different order, which I immediately disputed as I have an email with the correct order number filed. Then they changed the story telling me that they MISLEADED me. And that no A-Z guarantee claim has been filed!?So I was told they will raise it up and the new A-Z guarantee claim is filed and I had to wait 1 week. I did wait and they just send me a message that they denied the claim and that I had to go to bank sort it out myself.I disagreed and appealed the claim. Been told 24 hour to wait and that they will call me.Nobody did. I had to call today to find out that they don't know why nobody contacted me and now they filled another claim which takes 24hrs.So now its almost 4 week without my phone I paid £200 pounds.If they will not sort me out I will take it to trading standards and will file official complaint. The new papers will also hear of this.Pretty disgusting from Amazon as Im customer for over 10 years and spend a lots of money.The fact they been lying to me is hard to accept and the £200 pounds is another issue.If amazon is becoming this sort of business then Im done. Ebay and other sites have better prices as I find out today.I will seek legal advice to seek the compensation.",0
"****Latest entry*****So as my previous review went I have been happily shopping with Amazon since 2005 and the customer support has been exemplary.So what the hell happened, back to back to back issues, generic responses, can only us their crap chat or 'call you' which never calls me!Shambolic, gradually weaning myself off Amazon and shopping elsewhere.What went wrong!?!*****Original post*****It is quite hard to review a certain aspect of Amazon as they provide so many supports, of which I subscribe to being a Prime customer, premium Amazon music and own numerous echo and fire devices. And failure in one part of their support will result in ordinary feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past interactions with Amazon and it's customer supports which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can interaction with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a decent job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime order is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a decent word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a ordinary review than a decent one, as we expect the support to be decent from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the ordinary reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!",1
I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a item. Dont appreciate the attitude.,1
"Every time the Amazon delivery drivers drop off packages at my apartment building, they buzz every apartment. It has become increasingly bothersome to several other tenants, so I tried to contact amazon about it. They told me unless I had the persons name and order number, there is no way they can fix the issue, which I don’t have. Needless to say, most of us have stopped ordering on amazon, as they will do nothing to fix this issue.",0

"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping assistance. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few average and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman assistance suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1
Great prices and service. Shipping time and cost not ideal to Australia though,2

"Had a mixed bag of experiences until this year and now nothing goes right. An item you select for that day or next day delivery doesn't turn up or does but it's damaged or missing a whole load of stuff. Amazon, a company that is supposed to make your life that bit easier, has caused me nothing but stress and amped up my anxiety on the past 3 deliveries especially, even missing most of the first day of my first holiday in 8 years. The mental health and mobility awareness is nonexistent. Never using again.",0
I absolutely love Amazon prime the addition of movies  and next day delivery on thousands of products is incredible sometimes I would sooner wait for the delivery man to arrive the next morning or afternoon than queue in a store. its the future of shopping,2
Have been a loyal customer for years … the drivers lately are rubbish… items say they were delivered and not … I live in a flat today the driver rang the bell I opened the ground floor door and he throws in the parcel… I have 2 kids and could t get down straight away… now the parcel is gone …. If you can’t deliver to the door then don’t be a delivery driver …,0

Amazon is just as worthless as eBay. And what's worse is just like eBay they are cowards and hide behind the fact that they make it very difficult to try to contact them. They say they have easy email but I had to search the web to try to find it and still couldn't find it. Goodbye Amazon not going to waste any more of my money at your store.,0

"Where to begin.... shall we start with trespassing, going straight to the back door through a double latched gate without even attempting a front door delivery is unacceptable, oh and what about failed deliveries on time, I was paying for a service and next day was apart of it (yes there are some exceptions) within a 2 week period I have had 3 deliveries failed, 1 was 2 days late, another was ""accidentally sent to wrong distribution centre"" and then disappeared resulting in having to claim a refund 2 days later, latest is an item ordered and at checkout the usual order within next (xx time) for garenteed delivery xx date (next day) only to not even out for delivery let alone dispatched the next day, contacted (the joke they call customer service) to be told item is out of stock so I request cancellation,  two hours later checking order details notice cancellation request not actioned so do it myself only to receive email to say cancellation cannot be actioned as order is in processing.

"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was decent timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer assistance, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your assistance is no longer acceptable.",1
Prime is not what it used to be! Tell you one date and it’s out for delivery then they reschedule for 5 days later. poor service. You speak to a bot it says it won’t be delivered till January and then gives you two options refund or you’re ok with it. Great!,0

Terrible customer service! Ordered some supplements and selected overnight delivery 4am to 8am. Well 8am comes and no package so I use their chat to find out where it is. The agent (sohail) was very rude and told me he would use “simple words” to explain that it may take 2-3 days even though item showed available and would be delivered overnight. As you can imagine my response was slightly colorful at which point he disconnected the chat. Well I had to call and they refunded my money but I’m still SOL on my supplements! Great way to treat your prime customers Amazon!,0
"I haven't been very happy with the Amazon Prime Service for a while now.   I mainly use prime for shipping.  Not for free movies and books.  When I contacted them about assistance I got a small credit and a story about warehouses in strategic locations for expedited shipping.  Really don't care about how many warehouses they have or if they have to swap stock items between warehouses.  I order something, then I expect it delivered in 2 or 3 days because I paid for prime shipping.  End of story to me.  Not Amazon's story.  I have repeatedly had to navigate their site to send a message regarding shipment.  Normally their shipping and shipment estimates are off I am waiting and waiting for my item to be processed then shipped.  The waiting 3 5 or 6 days on them to ship something and then see it expedited doesn't make me happy..  Well, what bothers me is that because their swapping between warehouses isn't my fault, but the checkout button says I can pay more to have stuff shipped when it becomes available.  I already paid for prime.  So when I order 4 things in 1 cart order - my entire orders sits.  I started making separate orders for a while and then often I needed something that is a +$25 add on item.  Just tired over amazon's game.",1

"I won't go into all the awful details, because it's frankly not worth more of my time. The broad strokes are someone hacked our account we've had for nearly 20 years, changed the email & phone # associated with the account, turned on 2 factor authentication, & ordered 4 (yes, FOUR) robotic vacuum cleaners totaling $1700. My husband spent over 20 hours in one week on the phone with Amazon trying to get them to let us back into our account, give us our money back, cancel the order, etc. Supposedly they were having their IT dept go thru code line-by-line because they were baffled as to how someone was able to hack our account. Never got any answers on that account. The phone number & email address associated with our account had only been changed once in nearly 20 years (by us) - that didn't raise any red flags?? We've never bought one let alone FOUR robotic vacuums... THAT didn't raise any red flags?? They eventually gave us our money back, but our account remained locked, even to us. We routinely spent over $10,000 per year with them, more when COVID hit. They could not have cared less about retaining us as customers. No compensation for massive amounts of our time wasted due to their lousy security. No explanation. No follow-thru. I'd give them zero stars if I could. Now we only buy thru them when we absolutely have to have something & we absolutely cannot find it anywhere else, which amounts to next to nothing. Forget this place. They are the absolute worst.",0
"I was happy until they switched over to this Amazon Logistics bull crap with 3rd party carries instead of using USPS. Gifts I ordered for order to family in a different state was left on side apartment door vs. in the lobby. Did not ring my mother's apartment to let her know they were there other times. Yesterday I was expecting a package, it shows delivered and I was fed some excuse by the customer support rep that some ""new drivers"" may be scanning packages of delivered before they are. While this may be a chance due to the holiday season, I am giving them today for the package to show. If it does not, I will be asking for a refund or for the goods to be re-sent.",1

"Every time I have to contact customer service whether an item has become faulty in the warranty period, my little one ordered movies on my account or when I broke my kids tablet by accident they have been brilliant either full refund or sent a new item. Times when my item has not been delivered I get an email to say attempted I ask customer service to try again as was in and they make sure the driver trays again. The delivery service is brilliant, only downside to having prime is not a great selection of films or tv on the prime, but that's not what I got it for.",2
"I only ever had one issue with Amazon, I bought something which was not as described, returned it and then Amazon never gave me the money back - It was all of £20 or so.Other than that, I've always had excellent experience with Amazon.",2
"I have been with amazon since 2009 and have been buying a whole lot stuffs from it and mostly satisfied with. It is not anymore. I recently ordered a lot of things from this platform too. However, many of my ordered have been canceled with the same reason which says “cannot delivered/have problem with order”. All the canceled orders sold by amazon and a US based company. Not any orders sold by China based has been canceled. What happened to Amazon? Is it a China Company now? I am so disappointed and frustrated.",1
"Repeatedly value and service, one of first places to look online.",2
Normally I’m happy with Amazon. They deliver fast and have a wide variety of choice. Prices are not always very competitive though. What really sucks is the customer supports. Everything is standardized. No room for a personal touch. Today I received a toaster but It’s been used but the only thing I can do is send it back.  I would never buy something electronically. I guess you can’t trust their suppliers,1
"Amazon online shopping app is absolutely hopeless. Just because I had the audacity to change my payment details, this ridiculous website, refused to recognise my old details,  my new details, my old password, all new passwords,  and my email addresses !Awful Amazon's woeful website, is a bunch of bilge.",0
"Just got off the phone with Amazon. If you ever follow their instructions to cancel a shipment that has been shipped via Amazon Logistics, don't. If they always ship to you via their Amazon Logistics, think about it seriously. If the courier marks the package as ""refused"" and doesn't return it to an Amazon facility, Amazon will try to refuse the refund if one of their ""top notch"" couriers decides you don't need the item but they do. According to Amazon Customer Service, I am responsible for THEIR courier. I don't remember that job interview..",0
"Anytime I ordered something I recieved it, packaging unharmed and intact. Their customer support assistance is extraordinarily horrible though",1
Amazon is going downhil. I have ordered from them for as long as I remember. I have prime membership but still packages are delayed and broken and then have to go to shop to return it and if you live in a village it is a big hassle specially when you don't have car and have to wait for buses.,0
"For the last six months we have had over 10 orders not show up or show up very late. Almost everything I order now is “delayed” and just never comes. Now Amazon is trying to re-charge us for items they refunded for us because they came super late (1 month+) without our concent.Furthermore, Amazon customer service has taken a huge nose dive. They do not take care of their customers any more. They refuse to let you report a package until after 5 days past expected delivery, they won’t work with people, they do not let you speak with a manager or honor Amazon prime promises  like 2 day shipping. I have had multiple customer service reps just disappear from our chats etc. It’s a shame. I’ve been a loyal Amazon customer for over 13 years…they used to care and go above and beyond. Now you just get penalized and never even receive your products.",0
"Late delivery. Reached out to customer service and that's where the sister began. After telling him specifically not to cancel my order he cancelled the order. It was literally a few miles away. Did Amazon do anything to help me , absolutely not. Left me fuming",0
Review sites should start giving us the opportunity to leave negative star reviews. I bought a set of frangrances from one of their sellers. They turned out to be fake. They must have bought the real versions split them and mixed them with water. The company changed it’s name the minute I placed the order. Insane!! Amazon says I can’t leave a review exposing them. WHATEVER!! Then I’ll leave one exposing them! On numerous review sites!!,0
"Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their item line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s fine name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the items they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!",1

"I have done business with Amazon for years and have had several instances where things did not go as planned.  Items arrived damaged, items were not delivered or where delayed.

"Update, after a day of back and forth plus a trustpilot review I finally got a comprehensive answer and I am now have all the info and reasons why I cannot post my item review.

I was sent an email to say it was rejected. Fair enough. Why it was rejected is not noted so I looked at the guidelines and popped back on to right a review within these guidelines. Not allowed. Barred for writing a review because I really like something? Emailed the address given by Amazon for any questions regarding this. Reply states they cant find the review. Yes that would be correct Amazon- as you rejected it, the review wont be there. I replied and got another email stating I had emailed the wrong place and was given guidelines on how to report dodgy reviews. I have emailed again asking for someone to actually read my first email and let me review the item I purchased.

"I was awarded digital credits due to delayed shipping.  When I tried to use the credits they were not honored. Spoke with customer service and they were not very helpful.  Polite but uninformed. After sometime I was given codes so I could use my rewards, but the codes failed.  My 17.00 dollar digital credit was lowered 12.00 shopping credit by email. Tried to use 12.00 on several items, no luck.  Appears to be another bad credit.  Spoke with customer service again, unresolved.  Wasted time and became very frustrated trying to work with Amazon.  I hope to never pay this company another dime.  I plan to shop everywhere else not to support this behavior.",0
Great company but very confusing.  When is an item from Amazon and when is it not.  When can you get support and when are you stuck with no returns policy?That and they are killing mom and pop local stores.,1
Using AmazonExcellent service and delivery of all goods on time. So far my expectations re quality and standards have been fulfilled. Well done.,2
My packages have been late at least 6 times this month and another 4 the month before. I think it’s excessive to be late. It’s guaranteed to get there on that date as instructed by them. They make up they needed to check another fulfillment center which is ridiculous then don’t put that it’s available. I have several fulfillment centers and they don’t deliver on time.,0

"Amazon's onboarding process as a potential seller is horrible! For a couple months I have been trying to list items. Amazon has sent me emails numerous times that my account is verified and I am ready to list.However, when I try to list (via adding a product not sold on Amazon) I get this, ""Problem with your Seller AccountYou’re currently unable to add or edit listings because either the credit card on file is invalid or the credit card is in the process of validating, which could take up to 24 hours. Please ensure that you have a valid credit card uploaded in Account Settings.""I have quadruple checked my credit card info matches my legal identity. That everything matches up 100%. Not only that I use this card on a daily basis. I also use it with my Amazon prime account (under the same account) often! But, am considering dropping my prime account based on this experience.I keep getting canned responses that don't help and have requested phone calls more than once and not received one.Absolutely horrible!",0

I also had received a item nothing like what it was suppose to be, I had to get a return on that, I had to talk to 3 different people to get that processed, which a return takes up to 5 business days, they can take our money out in a day but then the return process is such crap!

Meanwhile I'm still waiting for mine to be send, left alone getting a shipment date. Obviously they arent totally terrible as they do send the packages and have acceptable prices. I just don't like their choice of shipment support and my usages so far haven't been that acceptable.",1
"At one time, Amazon was an efficient, reliable and customer-focused organization. That being said, over the past 24 months, they have become one of the most unreliable and inefficient logistical/retail services I have ever dealt with. Products take longer to arrive when compared to other retailers who don't charge an annual fee and delivery windows are often missed. Customer service agents are based outside of North American and for the most part, are difficult to deal with and generally require further explanation and reiteration to resolve the most basic issues. We have also noticed a steep decline in Amazon's streaming services including the quality and reliability of the content. Lastly, we have found Amazon's customer experience extremely poor. Streaming subscriptions that provided specific movies, that we have maintained for several years are no longer available and can only be ""purchased or rented"". This is extremely poor practice and given that it appears to be (primarily) the movies we have watched, I am inclined to believe that this is an intentional act to force us to buy these movies despite already paying for the subscription. We will be canceling our Prime membership, along with all subscriptions in November when they raise the price.",0
"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2
"I ordered a mobile phone to replace one that had broken. Therefore it needed to arrive promptly. Naively as an Amazon Prime customer I thought I could rely on Amazon. Instead Amazon repeatedly lied to me and caused me a great deal of inconvenience, aggravation, frustration and added expense.LIE 1 : Day 01 - ‘The Item is in Stock’. Clearly it wasn’t  / couldn’t be dispatched.LIE 2 : Day 11 - ‘Your item has been dispatched’.  Untrue. No tracking information was forthcoming. The courier states Amazon did nothing other than ‘Prepare a label’.LIE 3 : Day 23 - ‘Your item will arrive by day 24’.  With great difficulty I got the attention a ‘customer service’ representative. I was told by this individual that the item would definitely arrive on day 24.  'I could trust him on that'. LIE 4 : Day 24 - ‘Sorry we a re running late. Your item will arrive by day 27’. Final lie. Day 27 the item never arrived.Exacerbating the WOEFUL service is the fact that when there is a problem there is no meaningful or practical mechanism to remedy the situation. When the system works it works. When it doesn’t there is no plan ‘B’. Amazon provides no access to anyone who is empowered to either investigate or remediate. Further they filter out and censor all criticism.",0

"XPO Logistics is the worst company ever. I ordered a play house for my granddaughters on Amazon . XPO Logistics was supposed to deliver it last Saturday. The drivers lied saying they knocked on the door. I waited all day thinking they were still coming. I received an email at 4 pm that night saying they tried to deliver but no one was home. I have two dogs that would have alerted me if someone was at the door.Then when I called to complain that they never tried to deliver the package the people on the phone where rude. Additionally, I found out they had my phone number wrong. I asked them to change it but I was told they couldn't change the number, I had to contact Amazon to have the number changed. The supervisor even refused to change the number or help me plus she was rude. ""You didn't see a big truck pull up in front of your house "". My bedroom are in the front of the house not my living area so how would I see them pull up to the house.I called Amazon and changed my number plus let them know I was unhappy with the shipment provider. Amazon changed my number in the system. By Wednesday I still had not received a call to deliver the playhouse. So I called to find out why. The lady on the phone was actually helpful. She explained they where calling the wrong number despite the notes in the system giving the correct phone number. She actually changed my number so the organization could contact me when they were delivering.Today I was given another 4 hour window. I called to try and find a smaller window explaining I have things I need to get done (the stuff I couldn't get done last weekend because I waited all day). Again the lady on the line was rude and unhelpful.If you order something and find that this company will be delivering it. I suggest you find the goods somewhere else.

"Shipping is falling short. It is difficult to find where your stuff is and the ""get it by"" dates are not accurate.

A ordinary situation, frustrated by a ordinary selling/buying platform. I'll stick with eBay even though they've gotten worse over time. @least you can communicate with the sellers.",1

"I’m truly shocked by this cumulative rating! How have people had this many bad experiences with Amazon?I purchased regularly from Amazon and I’m a prime member. I’ve never had issues with returns that couldn’t be resolved with a phone call. I have received hundreds of excellent products through their site.I’m not thrilled that they have a monopoly in this industry, but their innovation has made our lives easier. It’s amazing they can deliver products on the same day you order. And with no fee! I’ve been able to order items that I’d never find in a local store.I don’t love that. The majority of their products are made in China. But that’s true for every brick and mortar store as well. It isn’t Amazon‘s fault that factories have been outsourced to another country.I love that anyone who wants to order from Whole Foods can do so through Amazon. I’ve done this once and it was helpful.The return process couldn’t be easier. The length of time allowed for returns around the Christmas holiday is wonderful. I do wish they’d allow a longer window for returns during the rest of the year. With such high sales volume it would likely create chaos though.I’m a fan even if I don’t agree with all of their practices. Thank you for making my daily life more manageable.",2

I was told by 2 different Amazon agents that I will be reimbursed for the shipping fees. Yet, now when asking for the refund, I was told It will not happen as the agents made a mistake.This is not my fault that your agent made a mistake in the answer they gave me, I’m expecting Amazon to take responsibility for its agent mistakes.

"In relation to Order # 205-8187368-2071530:On 18th December I placed an order with Amazon for around £250 worth of items using their Prime 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery service. The order consisted 11 different items (a range of toys and other gifts bought for Christmas to give to family and friends). Amazon in the past have been a very reliable and reputable company with exemplary customer service so I felt that this was a convenient and safe option to make sure I had everything arrive in time for Christmas. This, however, was the start of my Christmas nightmare.The following day, nothing arrived. This was not an issue however, as my family were not coming to visit until the following Saturday so there was still another 4 days left before it would present any sort of problem for me. On the Wednesday, 3 of the 11 items turned up. On Thursday, nothing. On Friday morning, I finally receive a phone call from my sister (whose address the parcels were due to arrive at) telling me she was starting to get worried as most of the items had still not arrived and they had to be ready and wrapped for the following day to give to my visiting family members who live in a different part of the country. Given the urgency of the situation, I decided to take a break from work and give Amazon's customer service department a call.I initially spoke to a member of their team who looked into the situation and found that the items had indeed not been delivered, but that it should be fine and they would most likely arrive later that day. I explained my situation to them and told them that essentially if the items did not turn up I would be stuck with nothing to give to my family to open on Christmas day. I asked this member of staff to look into the situation again so that they could absolutely guarantee this, at which point the line goes quiet and a few seconds later the call terminates. Not being satisfied with the outcome, I decide to call back again at which point I get through to another customer service agent who again appears to hang up the call. By this point I was getting very frustrated but given that I had no choice I decided to call them again.By this time, it was 3:00pm and I had already wasted around half an hour of my working day trying to sort the situation out. I then get through to customer service agent number 3, who I explain to that I haven't received my items - to which he replies that they will definitely arrive by 9pm that night. I then explain to the agent that I need this absolutely guaranteed as if they do not deliver the items by 9pm I would then not have an opportunity to go out Christmas shopping that day in order to replace the items they had not delivered. After some deliberation he agrees to go and double check for me, and, surprise surprise, he tells me that the parcels won't be arriving after all.By this point, I was absolutely fuming. I could not believe that after 5 days of waiting on their 'Guaranteed Next Day' delivery and an hour on the phone speaking to 3 different people they were actually telling me they were not able to deliver my parcels. All of this given that they DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY to contact me and let me know what was going on. Had my sister not bothered to contact me, I wouldn't have even known until the following day (by which point it would be too late).Anyway, I continued my conversation with agent number 3 and explained that I was absolutely disgusted by their level of service and that my only option was to finish work early (costing me around £50 in lost pay), travel to the town centre and spend the rest of my afternoon/evening shopping for presents that I didn't have the money for (since I had already spent it with Amazon). The initial response to this was to offer me a £5 Amazon gift card and 1 month free Amazon Prime (frankly an insult given the situation). They then offer me a refund to which I tell the agent it does not compensate me for the situation they have caused and I would be making a complaint and closing down my account (which I have had for over 10 years and spent many thousands of pounds with them on). He then decides to go and speak to his manager, and agrees that they will still fulfill the order and I will receive the items in due course, and they will issue me a full refund (which would instantly arrive in my account) for the items not yet received. Although I was not happy about having to leave work and roam around the town centre buying presents, I felt this was fair compensation and the best they could do given the situation. We then end the call and I head out of work.I arrive in a very busy town centre and attempt to look for anything which may be suitable given the money I had on my card. I enter Toys R Us and grab some toys for my niece and nephew, head to the counter and get my card out to pay. I enter my PIN and find that my card has been declined. I then try again, but it appears as though there is no money in my account. I then leave Toys R Us (the time is now about 5:00pm) and head to the Cashpoint machine to find that my refund has not yet arrived. I go on Amazon's live chat and the person I speak to tells me that the refund will arrive in 5-7 working days. Desperate, I call one of my friends who agrees to lend me £50 (not exactly enough for 8 gifts but better than nothing). I then spend my evening around town buying anything I can so at least there is something for my family to open for Christmas (aware that the items should arrive later on and I could always try and post them later).Christmas then comes and goes without too much bother. It comes to my attention in the first week of January however that the items had still not been delivered, so I decide its time to give Amazon another call. I get through to a customer service agent, and after saying a few words the call hangs up, so I call back again. I then get through to another agent who explains to me that my refund has been issued. I tell him that I have received the refund but I was still waiting for the items, for which he says the items had been returned and would not be sent out again. I then explain to them that I was still supposed to receive the items as per the agreement I made with them on the 22nd of December, to which he replies (surprise) that there are no notes on the system to this effect. He agrees to raise the issue with a manager for it to be investigated and I would definitely receive an email back about this in 5-7 days.2 weeks later, I still have no email or items, so I call Amazon again. After calling them three times and being hung up on and spending around 45 minutes on the phone I am finally put through to a supervisor. They tell me again that there is no notes on the system and there has been no investigation into my case. This time, I am promised a call back the following day at 5:00pm once the investigation has been done. I sit next to my phone at 5:00pm the following day but do not receive a call. I then check my Amazon account to find a message sent saying that they 'weren't able to reach me' and they were sorry that I was 'misinformed' that I would still receive the items. They tell me I should call back again for more information about it.I can tell you I have now given up trying to deal with their shambolic customer service team. The entire experience has been absolutely disgraceful and they should be ashamed of the way they have treated me as a longstanding and loyal customer of 10 years. I am now going to be closing my account with them and I will be posting my experience on every major review site online as well as telling all my friends and family. Amazon has embarrassed me at a supposed happy time of year and they don't seem to give a monkeys about their customers anymore. I will now be reporting them to the Advertising Standards Agency regarding their false advertising claims and I will be speaking to BBC's Watchdog about my case.I HAVE FULL EVIDENCE FOR ALL OF THIS BUT IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AS WE CAN POTENTIALLY WORK TOGETHER IN HOLDING AMAZON TO ACCOUNT ON THEIR FALSE CLAIMS AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.",0

"Amazon will make right by their customers. Of course everyone makes mistakes from time to time. But they stand by their return policy, bulky items often not even need to be returned to get refund in case there is a problem. Often, items will arrive earlier than promised, and you can even order to a nearby store or pickup location if you are more comfortable doing that.Amazon is famous for its costumer friendly policies and putting the costumer first.",2
"amazon customer service is so rude, I tried explaining to two different people on how I didn't receive my packages, they don't even listen or communicate and straight up end the call saying there is nothing else that can be done. I wasted 200 dollars just to not receive my packages TWICE and now I can't even get my money back?? Make this maks sense how is it my fault that my packages weren't delivered. I'm just trying to get my money back.",0

"Important update on Amazon help desk. Amazon Support 1-858 (666)-(0943),Phone number for Accounts and Billings office is open Mon-Fri at Salinas CA.I have been with Amazon for approximately 4 years. I purchased goodss as I usually do and all of a sudden my account were on a ""security hold."" This had not happened since I set up the account, which makes sense. Unfortunately for me, customer support would not explain why there was a ""security hold"" on my account when nothing had changed. They just told me I had to wait 8 days to recover my account. Excellent customer support and accountability for what they do with your account.",1

cheap and fast; they sure are. however they cant help me in the sales process; just undercut everyone else who can,1
"Overall 5 Stars for Amazon…I love the convenience! But this packaging, I give three stars bc I question the waste from the shipping dept. And it’s happened before. Why do they package 2 very small items in a huge box with 4 ft of air pockets?  What a waste!",1
Excellent customer services who listen and have a good speed to answer.  Great prices and quick delivery along with a massive collection of products and sellers.  Good reviews of each item and a well structured/searchable site.  The list goes on!  Get involved if you havent already!,2

"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music support, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new support at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new support at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1

Would have selected no stars but it wouldn’t let me. Terrible terrible service. I’m a prime customer and frequent buyer. Usually have deliveries to my home but needed something urgently for my dog and wanted to make sure I didn’t miss the delivery. Selected the closest Amazon locker to my home address. Received notifications it was delivered while I was out and felt thankful as would have missed it. Drove to locker location as soon as I could but there was no lockers. Just a big space and marks on the floor/wall as evidence that lockers were there once but not anymore. Security staff at the location confirmed that it didn’t exist anymore.  Trouble is tracking said it was delivered and I had been sent a barcode and draw number for it!!! Customer services couldn’t have been worse. Arguing with me that the item was there for collection and that I needed to collect it. I was passed through 6 agents. All bots I’m assuming as not answering my questions and repeating. Worst experience ever. Eventually spoke to a human who confirmed the lockers didn’t exist as were permanently closed but couldn’t explain why it was and still is an option for delivery on their site. The human told me I would have to wait a further 4 days for a refund and that was it. Cold hearted response. Could not give a toss that I needed the item today and I was so disappointed or that I had been around the houses trying to get one of the bots to help. Horrendous,0
Why has Amazon suddenly got so ridiculously more expensive than the shop. For example by Vileda active mop head £6.99 in Sainsbury's and everywhere else but £11.99 and more tab Amazon!  Shame on you cheat on people,1
"I think Amazon is guaranteed to be the only company still in business. I,ve ordered lots during lockdown. Always received goods promptly and delivery guy always pleasant. Ordered something 8pm last night being delivered today what service!",2
"Love Amazon, but the shipping companies they use always leave packages on front doorstep and then snap a picture.  As if that would prevent someone from stealing them.  Then when you complain, it becomes your problem!",1
"I find it very hard to understand in relation to an organisation. As large as Amazon cannot deliver one basic item. This item has cost me over £1500 and like for the fact that they couldn’t deliver on two separate occasions and Me persistently doing chase calls to get it. Redelivered is absolutely outrageous if Amazon wish to advertise and put items on their webpage to do it, they intend to sell, and if they know that that item is going to be of some conceptive heavy and they need to facilitate that it shouldn’t be down to the customer to get through to the point whether they’re gonna get cancelled and then get a refund absolutely disgusting. I think Amazon need a seriously look at the logistic all operation because it doesn’t function doesn’t work on top of which I don’t think really at the end of the day that are doing the deliveries need to pay attention to the information that’s been sent. I sent information directly onto the Amazon website given specific instructions and they were not followed very basic. We had to do was open the back garden door. The garden door was left open and then leave it there  Quite simple, but clearly not simple enough very poor service. ",0
"Great customer service, quick delivery, cheap prices",2
Amazon does not ship items when they say they will be delivered. They were great  but now less than good. If you mention them in a negative review it’s deleted. They now are as bad as physically shopping in side at Walmart.,0
Ok but a lot of fake items and account needs to be careful,1
"Amazon Delivery is terrible.  Even though drivers for every other services easily access our gated community, Amazon Delivery drivers often have problems.  If they make it through the gate, they then seem to have trouble finding my front door.  I've had packages left in the alley behind my garage door and at my neighbor's addresses and others just never show up..  Last night was just another example of bad service.  Even though Amazon's GPS tracking indicated their driver was just a few houses away and my delivery was next, my delivery never arrived.  Amazon's GPS tracking showed the driver instead drove to a location about 1/2 mile away and just stayed there before shutting off his signal about 45 minutes later.  My delivery of bedsheets needed for guest  last night never arrived",0

"I am getting frustrated , I make purchases through Amazon for convenience and based on shipment times & dates and I do not think that Amazon sellers nor Amazon as a retail venue should advertise they can deliver ""same day"" , ""next day"" or even ""Prime shipment"" when they CANNOT fulfill the transaction according to the terms when the item(s) were ordered . This happens more times than not , it's aggravating and that is the point of this review !",1
"Awfull. Yesterday was ordering 2 cables and Headset for pc. Total should be 52 pounds.  Knowing i have mothly prime subscription i pressed deliver with Prime. They i open my  bank acc and im charged 95 pounds for prime, and items havent been ordered because it not enough of money.  Wth? I never asked them to charge me for year subscription. Then the support is missleading aswell. They say - you can cancel or change your services. Dont do it! It may seem that it will cancel subscribtion or change to monthly and just give the difference back. It will charge you again! Dont do it! And instead of ordering me my items , it just decidet f items , take prime for year you want ot or not. Now im left without items and need to wait for refund 5-7 working days.  How come you can take my money any second , but returning process is takes a week.On other hand it was easy to get refund, suspiciously easy. Like they get theese calls everyday. No chance i will order anything from there anymore",0
"There's been a lot of wrong items sent to me lately. I've shopped at Amazon for years and recently there's more errors with the orders. I notice this is more common with high priced items being 'mistaken' for much cheaper ones. My last order was supposedly delivered to me, which was supposed to be a $60 drink mix pack, and instead I had received someone's clearly worn and returned sports bra. What's so hard about installing a camera system to have full view of all employees as they work?! I had to spend 2 hours of my Sunday trying to print a return label and drive around to the nearest actual UPS drop off location for their mistake. Now I have to wait even longer and hope they can get it right this time. Makes me feel as though I now have to video-record picking up my package at the locker in its entirety, which is ridiculous. I was reading somewhere that Amazon is instilling a lot of fear in employees and publicly shaming those who are caught stealing but I feel that simply installing more cameras and looking into discrepancies as they happen would prove more effective in getting rid of dishonest workers.",0
Admin thanks ,2
Can't fault Amazon! Products are of good quality and speedy delivery. Always reliable as well and customer service is amazing. Would recommend to anyone!,2
"They should verify what sellers are selling... a solar panel of 10 by 20 cm can never be 50wp as an example.Solarchargers of type mppt that are not that type at all, ordinary performances. Not every buyer is an expert.And all these rubbish sellers are ordinary for Amazon, despite Amazons acceptable order procedures",1
"I have 2 issues with Amazon. I have an issue with having to send things back via UPS, we don't have a UPS store here. You can, however, print out a label they will send you, and you can put it in the UPS Dropbox, however we don't have those and I don't have a printer! So if I get things that don't fit or I just don't like them I cannot send them back and I'm stuck with them. It gets old. The second issue I have is their packaging. Most of the time you get 1 or 2 small items in a large box, what a waste. sometimes they come in plastic envelopes and are smashed because there's no protection.I'd rather have small boxes because then they fit in the parcel lockers at the Post Office and I don't have to take off of work early to go pick up my packages because they don't fit. I can recycle the cardboard, I just think it's stupid to put a calendar in a box that you could fit 10 pairs of shoes in it. I've contacted them several times about these issues and have yet to see a response. And I use amazon ALOT!",1
"1) Amazon had a listing of what seemed like a counterfeit product (<$500 price tag for what should have been a $2k item.)2) Amazon representative told me that they personally vetted the product and that it's authenticated. I have screenshots of this conversation.3) I ended up buying the product. When I received it, it was obviously fake. Still, I paid a professional authenticator and they confirmed that it's counterfeit.4) I reported this to Amazon, they apologized, but they did not allow me to post my review on the seller's product page!In short, Amazon sold me counterfeit AND is covering up for a seller who should not only be banned, but reported to authorities.Forgot to mention, I'm a ""prime"" customer, who had easily spent multiple 5 digits with this garbage business, not out of love, but out of necessity. This is what you get when you allow psychopaths to have monopoly over the market, and then you push small businesses to shut down during a pandemic.EDIT:Remember the fake bag I bought, which the seller only had ONE of? Well, the merchant, now has a mysterious 5 star review that says ""Love it!""Except this review was posted while I was in possession of the one bag. Sooo either they're lying about stock levels to create false scarcity, or they're creating fake reviews. Take your pick.",0
"Gave Amazon Japan another go for a neck care device . Here's the quick take : On the plus side, the shipment was quick and they also allow you to deliver to a local score which is very convenient. On the downside the device was quite porly packaged and I'd have returned it if it wasn't for the pain with getting in touch with customer support . However I have to say the device works well and for less than ¥3,000 I am pretty satisfied ",1

"I'm quite picky when it comes to companies I deal with, and tend to leave reviews usually based on bad service. But this time I've something positive to raise. I was considering cancelling my prime membership and decided to do just that, but then forgot it for a week. Today the payment got taken (year subscription) and though well, that's 80 quid gone, but thought also that I'd log in and check if it's possible to cancel after a payment has been taken. Turns out it is and they'll pay you back for unused time, no fuss, no having to call them. Simple.",2
"Amazon is a really great company however, Amazon Prime can be annoying, when it says next day delivery, this sometimes means you will get it in a couple of days.  Amazon do have a 2 hour delivery spot which is amazing for a £20 purchase. Apart from that, it is very good for bargains and has a massive range of products anything you can imagine.  I spend most of my time on Amazon don't really bother with other sites.  If I have ever had any problems they seem to resolve it very quickly.  I would of gave them a 5 star review but unfortunately sometimes I've been waiting days for my parcels.",2

I did say, its only price matching with yourself.I needed the item urgently for work so couldn't return and reorder, which is weirdly what they said that I could do???? Just refund the difference.

Any order I have had issues with has been quickly and easily resolved. The Subscribe and Save is fantastic.  Monthly deliveries of items I use at a minimum of 5% discount.The Prime Video is great and I use it often.  You can add other offerings like BritBox and more.

All she kept saying was ""let me process it"" and she would put me on hold again. She told me it was an old kindle from 2012. I have not had or used that kindle in years and years. Also how did this link to a credit card that did not exist back then This is a new credit card of less than 6 months. I assured her my children do not have or use kindle. She grilled me non stop and kept putting me on hold. I spend hundreds of dollars on Amazon. One look at my account and they could have seen how good a customer I am. Now 45 mins later I'm on hold waiting for a supervisor. REALLY!!",0

"Amazon is Ok, but it has some problems, and there are things that I don't like about this company. One time, I ordered something on Amazon, but my account got locked up for some reason because Amazon thought something suspsious is going on. I was able to unlock it, but it was a big hassle to unlock. I also had to call Amazon Customer Service. I also don't like how you can't order with paypal. I read that Amazon workers are working very hard and get paid very little, which is why one of the reasons I try to ignore Amazon. It's a very big company though, so it should be expected. I also one day ordered an item, but it did not arrive, but Amazon helped me. Overall, Amazon is ok, but try to avoid it if you can.",1

"This company does not offer you prices that are better.  The quality of merchandise is very bad.  I had purchased for 150.00 a cage and it came broken, purchase 5 pairs of pants said to be made in the USA but were actually from China, lets just say the sides were all ripped within a few minutes of wear.. their ebooks (which they guarantee 7 day return) can actually be taken from you for no reason and they do not give you the money you purchased.  Their reason is that you are not actually the owner but just renting them.. You can not read them on any item other than something they sell so if you cancel your amazon then you loose everything you have purchased (e-books).  There are better places to make purchases that don't fatten their pocket book and cost you money, items that will be better.. I spent over 35000.00 on this company over the years and am now finding this out as well.  Every item I purchased were not American made (or even better quality) but were made from China.  Every single E-book I have had to fight to get back and the kindle fire that I purchased worked only for 7 months.. I had to download the application to read them on the computer which is a pain. This company does not look out for their customers just their pocket books.  Once again do not use this company, there are way better ones that make and sell better quality items.",0
"I ordered a cricut joy from Amazon and I picked the time they offered for delivery. When it didn’t show up at the time they promised, I discovered it was in Texas still. I live in Florida. I then found out it was being sold for $20. Cheaper. Because it was so late they gave me a discount and promised they would get it to me the next day. I saw it eventually made it to the Lakeland Amazon distribution center in Fl. 2am. In the morning. When I woke up, it was still there, but my other package that was there shipped and was out for delivery. At 3pm I called them and before they picked up my phone call a notice came across my phone saying it was being delayed. Ok, still waiting for them to pick up my call. Some guy finally answered, and said it got damaged and my only option was put my money back on Amazon credit or back to my account. After waiting three days extra and they did nothing to fulfill my order. I tried to write my review, but they wouldn’t publish my review because it wasn’t about the product. I could not find a place on Amazon to complain about there shipping, and there should be a place. I got my cricut joy and also bought a hammock elsewhere. They lost about $400. From me over shipping. I wish I could just not buy from them anymore, but from now on they are my last choice to do my business with.  Also the money they promised to give me on my account for the late shipment disappeared, so they just took back the machine and canceled my reimbursement. Shame on you Amazon.",0
Amazon has the WORST customer service. These people truly make it known they don’t give a *%#^ about you or the issue that you are experiencing. Also many of these people are so incompetent that I would rather be dealing with a primate.,0

Quick support... very nice,1
"Its better to buy things in other specific online shops. After being a loyal customer of Amazon and after having bought so many products with them, their customer service and customer protection has become very bad. They accept SCAM companies to sell on their website and they do nothing to help you. I never received the package of my last order, no response from the seller and NO HELP from Amazon. Me, my family and some friends will cancel their Amazon Prime Memberships and we will not buy there again until they focus again on giving a proper customer service.",0
"Amazon in Spain uses the worst delivery services in Spain: SEUR. They don't even bother to show up at your door and then pretend that you were absent. Recently, they even pretended that one of my package had been delivered despite having received nothing. A scam.",0
"I bought some vinyl records from amazon recently, but when they arrived I found they had warped from heat and were damaged beyond repair. I contacted customer service and they immediately offered to send me replacements, without even requesting that I send back the defective items first. This is top class customer service!",2
Amazon Europe is slow with incredibly long waiting times.,1
orders can end up anywhere but usually quick,1
"WHATEVER you do, DON'T accept an invitation to upgrade your personal Amazon account to business!  It's a scam so that you lose your video library and can never use it again!!!  No entertainment and they don't tell you when they make the offer!  I have spent 3 days on customer service calls and the answer is ""You can't fall back, you can't have your library, you are screwed.""  BEWARE!  Great for personal accounts, don't EVER think of becoming business attached.",0

"During this period of pandemic so many companies use covid-19 as an excuse to be very slow. NOT Amazon. Everything my wife and I have ordered has been delivered within twenty four hours, sometimes the next day. Well done.",2
Some of their market companies are not reliable and apperintly Amazon takes little to no responsibility.  Been waiting on an order forever.   Wish the company would at least contact me.,1
I would not recommend amazon to anyone. I have noticed multiple times they have charged me more than what my order says I will be charged and every time I bring it up they either tell me they didn't make any charges or check with my bank. This time she tried to tell me they didn't take any money so I asked if I could send screenshots because she said the transaction IDs were incorrect I emailed the screenshots to her. Then she came back with that money is just on hold not taken out to call my bank. When your sneaking money from people your scamming them period! Even if it's a dollar here or there.,0
"Amazon gets worse by the second. The majority of their outsourced representatives are rude, inexperienced people, who have not only lied to me but refuse to transfer me to US representatives or supervisors, two literally hung up on me today. I received a damaged item was given wrong information to throw it away, so I did and now other representatives are denying me a refund which is all of 12.00. Nothing to Besos, hard worked money to me, which these foreign workers do not care nor understand. Keep it up, greed reunions a lot with time.   Look where these things are being made, most in China.   I’m canceling their card and ending this foreign relationship.",0
"Lately Amazon have got absurdly high prices on items and shipping, eg. Small animal treat 50gram pack $AU65. 00 plus $AU100. 00 Shipping cost, how can you justify that, plus if you want to buy multiple items it won't allow you.",1
"I love Amazon! Great products, quick delivery, excellent customer service, but... Double check prices with other sellers, Amazon isn't always cheap. Often it's not even Amazon, but a 3rd party seller on the Amazon platform. Track your delivery with shop.com to make sure you really get it. With doorstep thieves running around, have them drop off the package at a pick-up location if nobody is home, or it may be gone before you get to it. Great return policy, no questions asked.",2
"I purchased a pair of heels and what I received was nothing like I ordered. When I tried to return them, the seller said ""I hope that I like my order and to write a review."" I sent them a picture of what I was shipped and what I ordered so they could see the egregious mistake. They said they do not offer returns. I made a complaint to Amazon and they said I had to pay for shipping. The shipping cost more than the shoes did and while I received the shoes from Bakersfield, CA I had to ship them back to China to some random warehouse. NEVER AGAIN!",0

"I have been a prime member for several years now.  I live in Key West, FL and needless to say not much variety in shopping unless you drive 3+ hours to Miami.  Christmas, Birthdays, or simple needs I can one click and have my item here in two days (sometimes three.)  I don't really use all of the prime features, usually just the free 2 day shipping.  My kids use the free video service and they love it!  Good job Amazon, keep up the good work!",2
Overall amazon have been pretty fine but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as average as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,1
I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day order and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1
"Would give 0 if I could. You don't censor me.  Cancelled prime, and will never again order anything thru amazon.  You are communist pigs",0
Good for customers but a nightmare for sellers! Their customer-centric policies make it difficult for sellers to make a profit as the company would accept a return from customers even if the customer has damaged the item beyond repairs!,1
"Numerous damaged packages received lately.Also, charged for Amazon Prime when it indicated it was suppose to be a free trial.",0
"Yes, the prices on Amazon are great and the selection is awesome, but their constant pushiness to sign up to prime is annoying. I know that it's how you guys make your money, but start off by adding free shipping globally, and then, maybe, it will be justified...",1
Very well written the format was great the footnotes were helpful fine reading material I felt the sadness and joy,1
As the title says. They delivered my twitch streaming compuer very fast! Would use again,2
"Fails to get 5 stars because of confusion from multiple sellers, and mailing cost differences",2
"I have shopped Amazon for years and have never been disappointed.  Most times, I can buy what I want with just one click and I have the product the next day.",2
"I have been an Amazon customer since the mid 90's. I don't expect any company to be 100%. Amazon is so big now they just aren't trying. Kindle software stinks the past year, customer assistance is unavailable, and no one in charge cares further than the stock price. I was a huge fan. Now I am looking for the competition.",1
"Total RIP OFF Don't trust them at all i tried purchasing 10 of each 3 items on prime day and twice my order was cancelled without any reason, rang customer service they as well don't know what is happening. No point in wasting your money for Prime membership when amazon can't offer you anything.",0
"We were given a voucher for over £200. We have tried ordering 2 tvs and a desk all at seperate times using our voucher. When complaining about it they first said the item was still coming and then weeks later said the item couldn’t be delivered. We asked for the money so we could spend it elsewhere and they said no, with no compensation. Essentially we have lost that money. If I had enough money or spare time I’d take legal proceedings.",0
I had a very great and amazing business experience with this platform.But work more on your products.Kudos to you guys,2
"Amazon is normally good for shopping.slow for delivery. There is no place on site to complain about delivery. My package was left outside by sidewalk in the rain,i have a covered porch where it could have been placed and my email stated it was left with resident which was a lie!",2
The perfect company for just about all things.,2
"Awwww, so average usage with them. Paid online and got nothing!!!!",1
"Awfull. Yesterday was ordering 2 cables and Headset for pc. Total should be 52 pounds.  Knowing i have mothly prime subscription i pressed deliver with Prime. They i open my  bank acc and im charged 95 pounds for prime, and items havent been ordered because it not enough of money.  Wth? I never asked them to charge me for year subscription. Then the support is missleading aswell. They say - you can cancel or change your services. Dont do it! It may seem that it will cancel subscribtion or change to monthly and just give the difference back. It will charge you again! Dont do it! And instead of ordering me my items , it just decidet f items , take prime for year you want ot or not. Now im left without items and need to wait for refund 5-7 working days.  How come you can take my money any second , but returning process is takes a week.On other hand it was easy to get refund, suspiciously easy. Like they get theese calls everyday. No chance i will order anything from there anymore",0
"Amazon as a company has decided to limit free speech and free enterprise by limiting conservative apps from operating.  They have created a monopoly among the other tech giants and I am done giving them any more money.  I will take my business elsewhere.  Not to mention over half of what you buy on there site is junk.  They have been peddling made in china garbage far too long.  Quit selling out the American people and their businesses.  I have been a Prime member since 2006, and will no longer give Amazon a penny!  Have a great 2021 Amazon.",0
"The quality is extremely poor. We used Amazon for a while but more often we found we were retiring items, chasing refunds etc. Amazon clearly allow anyone to sell , a lot of items are coming from China. Very time consuming to sort out the issues. The days of Amazon are in the wind.",0
Got my kitty litter delivered but it was clumping kitty litter and we have had ice and snow which is now melting and amazon leaves the kitty litter in the water from melting snow and ice. Why can't the amazon driver knock on the door . I was home but didn't know he showed up so now my kitty litter is useless because it has clumped up . What  is wrong with amazon !,0

"Ordered a Fire Stick on Black Friday. They charge me $119 a year for next day or 2nd day shipping, When I ordered it, they told me a week? I wasn't too happy but wanted the product. The day it was supposed to arrive they sent me an email pushing it back again. I called customer service and they told me it is their busy season and that's the issue. No solution other than an offer of a $10 credit on my next purchase. Of course the day it was supposed to arrive after being pushed back, another email extending delivery another week. What am I paying $119 a year for? I can get terrible service for free! Don't use Amazon!",0
"Amazon is not perfect but a company that never wrong a customer at its own expense deserve great respect. Bravo Amazon, well on your way to become the most valued brand in the entire world.",2
"I have always rated Amazon highly, but my recent experience has been awful. I was sent a replacement product and was advised there was no need to send the faulty product back. But after the return window was over, Amazon charged my credit card. I tried to explain to many people why the item was not sent and the date discussion happened, but no one would listen or check the previous correspondence; they simply terminated the chat. This is how customers are treated at Amazon. Such a nice company, but earning a bad reputation due to a few bad people who don't deserve to be in customer service.",0
"The first week of March, 2019...I left Gillette a negative review based upon their Anti-Male commercial.  My review ranking, at that time, was around 9,000.  Within one week the review was removed and my review ranking shot to 61,542,907.  I called their Customer Service Team and their Dispute Resolutions Team and they both sent questions and forms to the only people that could help me...the Communities Team.  After hearing NOTHING from them I called both the Customer Service Team and the Dispute Resolutions Team and both said they felt like they were being ignored by the Communities Team.  Four weeks passed and I FINALLY got in touch with the Communities Team and all they have done is copy and paste things to me that relate to none of my concerns or questions, demand info from me that relates to nothing that is happening and threaten to shut down this investigation if their demands are not met.  Here is one demand.  What is the URL of the page you are having problems with.  I've mentioned over and over and over that the URL is my profile page.  I've given them my profile name and everything and yet they demand from me something I've already told them...and threaten to shut everything down if I don't tell them.  Ugh...  Did I also mention that in week 3 I found, on Amazon, a forum that the Communities Team runs. I tried to ask them a question on there but when I pushed the ""create thread"" button my question was immediately marked as spam.  So, anyway, this is week 5 of everything.  In retaliation for me complaining and with more helpful votes, my review ranking was dropped 400,000 to 61,973,473.Moral of the story here...  Amazon censors and punishes anyone who doesn't tow the Far-Left line.  They are a petty and vindictive company.",0
Amazon.com usually has great prices and of course unbeatable selection.,2
"What an absolute sham of a company when it comes to customer service! I added a new card to my account then bought a gift card to send to a friend, said order successful and I received the confirmation email. Immediately got locked out of my account due to suspicious activity on my account. There is absolutely no way to contact customer service, it just redirects you to the login page over and over. No options whatsoever of any phone numbers to call customer service. I even tried downloading the app, tried signing in but couldn't, was asked by the app to call customer service  number which was an invalid number. Going round and round in circles and getting nowhere. How is this even legal? They let you add your credit/debit card which you then confirm your card with your bank and then amazon block your account once you try to use your own already verified card? W.T.F! And seriously, trustpilot? How the hell is W.T.F without the dots inappropriate language?",0
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"Three times my items have not been delivered/ the service I have paid for has not been fulfilled and each time the customer service team are just equipped to antagonise and argue with me. Fobbing me off with bold face lies. Each time saying they will assure it won’t happen again… this is three times in a month?! The managers are worse than the agents. Antagonistic and rude. An absolute disgrace and so disgusting how they treat their loyal customers, causing harm to their mental health. Disgraceful.",0
"Amazon was always my go to, mainly because of the 2 day shipping. The order times have been very inconsistent for the past few months and a few items were canceled even though notifications were sent that the merchandise was out for order. Seriously considering not renewing my prime membership...",1
"What a complete shower. A useless company.Ordered goods, got emailed they had been delivered, but hey, they were not there. Tried to contact Amazon to resolve the issue. The phone lines were not working and online chat required the app which, for some reason, did not recognise the password I use to sign in.So now I am left with no goods and no means to rectify the issue.Mr Bezos, stop taking Star Trek actors Into sub orbit space flight and instead spend the money on your company infrastructure. This evening I have no goods, no means to contact anyone and your company have wasted hours of my time. My time and money may not be significant to you , but it is to me. This is the last time I use Amazon.",0

"It seems, when I have asked Alexa to play a track, I was automatically subscribed to Amazon Music- despite me answering NO, when she said this is part of Amazon Music do you wish to subscribe, and, I did not even listen to the track I'd requested. Shocking!When I talked to an operative this evening, it turns out that you have to Turn Off, Voice Purchase, found in Settings on your Alexa App.I pointed out that this should be made clear to people using the Alexa service. At the point when you say NO, you do not want to subscribe, that should be your word, NO! Just because they have your bank details, does not give them any more rights to take your money, to which they are not entitled. This is an unlawful practice, one which would not stand up in court. Assumed Consent???? I'm sorry Amazon, now I distrust you. This is very poor business practice. My trust in Amazon has plummeted.",0

Service has been the best for more than 10 years but customer service is the worst.,2
I have been purchasing regularly from Amazon since last two years and found only tolerable petty mistakes untill today when I came to know about the blunders Amazon do. I had ordered a carpet through Amazon making advance payment and the order was successfully placed and the advance money was debited from my account but to my surprise after two hours the order got cancelled by itself and the money was refunded. When asked to Amazon customer service they said the order was cancelled by the seller saying that the price quoted was wrong. I didn't know that Amazon only supports the sellers and not the buyers. How could someone quote less on an online portal and Amazon supports them blindly not holding them responsible for their mistakes. This is very sad and made me unhappy.Chennai- India,0
"SHAME on you Amazon!!  I have a defective item that is outside the return window.  I asked for a FAIR credit on my account and your management, LEXI, refused AND she also wouldn't give me her boss's name (she said it was against policy).  I spend A LOT of money through AMAZON, including being a Prime member for a very long time..that spending will NOW STOP....I will be using a company that appreciates my business from now on!!",0
"Just got off of an online talk with Amazon. It appears you can set up a ‘subscribe & save’ for an item but they will not send you the goods at a discounted price each month. It says (on my subscribe & save page) that the item i am waiting for is out of stock but when I click on the item it takes me to the page that clearly say item is in stock. Customer service says I can only have the item if I pay full price ? So what is subscribe & Save all about. Very poor, money grabbing Amazon.",0

"The WORST Customer Service EVER!! I can't login to my KDP Amazon account due to the 2 Step Verification as my old phone number has expired, so I request for help but the support I got was to make a phone call to their offices which cost me about $10+ for International Call then,they asked me to make a phone call to Amazon Customer Service near my country, I asked them the phone number but they asked me to search it on the website instead!!!It's been 2 weeks and I haven't got back to my old account because the 2 Step Verification is still ENABLED!!I have experienced this before in Instagram, their help service was fantastic compared to Amazon, I got my old Instagram account back in less than a day with no cost at all while in Amazon, I have to wait for 2 weeks, make an International Phone Call which cost me $10+ and still haven't got my account back!! WORST!!",0
"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 goodss that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 goods that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of goodss, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1
"I placed an order with Amazon on 3/20/20.  At the time I placed my order they credited my Gift Card Account, yet in an email they sent me states they do not charge until item is shipped.  That is a lie. Since May 20, 2020 I have been receiving emails from Amazon telling me they are sorry and I will receive and email when item is shipped.  I received an email on June 16 stating that my item would be shipped on July 25.  If they are not lying to me this time as they have been doing in the past, it will only have taken them 127 days or about 4 1/2 month to ship my item I ordered on March 20. I have ordered several items since 3/20/20 but not from Amazon.  I am through with ordering from Amazon.  I called them and I might as well been talking the phone to the wall.  He was no help and several times I had to ask if he was still there.  I started wondering if I was talking to a human or a computer.  I gave them one star and that was way too much.",0

"An Honest Review of Amazon I have been an Amazon customer for several years now, and I believe it's time to share an honest review of my experiences with the e-commerce giant. While Amazon offers numerous advantages and convenience, it also has its fair share of drawbacks that need to be acknowledged. Here's my breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:1. Vast Product Selection: One of Amazon's biggest strengths is its unparalleled product range. From electronics to clothing, home goods to books, you can find almost anything you need on their platform.2. Competitive Prices: Amazon's marketplace fosters competition among sellers, often resulting in competitive prices. You can often find great deals and discounts on various products.3. Convenience and Speed: Amazon's Prime membership offers fast and free shipping on eligible items, making it incredibly convenient for time-sensitive purchases. Additionally, their user-friendly interface and seamless checkout process enhance the overall shopping experience.4. Customer Reviews: The abundance of customer reviews provides valuable insights and helps make informed purchasing decisions. It's beneficial to hear others' experiences before making a purchase.Cons:1. Counterfeit Products: Due to the sheer number of sellers on Amazon, there is a risk of encountering counterfeit or low-quality items. While Amazon takes measures to combat this issue, it remains a concern for some buyers.2. Third-Party Seller Discrepancies: As Amazon allows third-party sellers, inconsistencies in product quality, customer service, and shipping practices can occur. It's essential to research sellers and read reviews before making a purchase.3. Environmental Impact: The rapid growth of Amazon's operations has raised concerns about its environmental impact, such as packaging waste and carbon emissions from delivery vehicles. They have made some efforts to address these concerns, but there is still room for improvement.4. Worker Conditions: Over the years, there have been reports and controversies regarding the working conditions at Amazon's fulfillment centers. These issues highlight the need for better worker treatment and labor practices.Overall, Amazon remains a convenient and popular platform for online shopping, but it's important to approach it with awareness of its limitations. Being an informed shopper and understanding the potential drawbacks can help mitigate any negative experiences. Amazon's continuous improvements and addressing of these concerns would undoubtedly contribute to a better customer experience and make it an even more reliable platform in the future.",2

Both me and my wife order regularly yet the drivers insist on walking across our decking and leaving parcels in front of the living room.

"As a prime member, I have been using Amazon services in India and overseas for a long time. But the recent incident made me rethink regarding availing the services again. Recently, during my vacation in Noida India, I requested a refund for my order. Consequently, there was a pick up of the delivered product, but the pick man was very rude and acted like a local goon. He came 2 times for pickup. On the first visit, he misguided me and told me that the product he had come to pick up was of a different color by showing one of the different color product pictures. The second time, when I asked him why he misguided me, he became quite rude and started abusing me in front of my house and was not ready to leave the property despite repeated instructions by me to leave the property. I have CCTV footage regarding the incident. I hope Amazon will take steps accordingly as the only automated reply I got from their customer service and the head team is that 'you are our precious customer and they will take strong action against the pickup agent', but until now there has been no action and when I asked them about the status they told me that it is an internal matter which shows how serious they are regarding the incident and don't care about the customer. I am planning to go legal and also posting the CCTV footage on the internet to aware the other customers regarding this rowdy pick up agent.",0
"As A prime member I supposed to have a two days delivery for an item to be delivered.  It took five days to arrive.

After many calls, finally my package arrived.I will never ever buy anymore from Amazon.  They don’t have any respect for their client.",0
"Amazon’s Pathetic Delivery Service. On average I usually have decent support with Amazon. However, today I am extremely dissatisfied.

Now, I have to wait an additional two days. Pathetic shipment support.",1
Amazon always has my back. I’ve never had a bad experience with them and I order thousands of times with them. Always fast and accurate shipping and will correct any problems with a generous return policy.,2

"Amazon prime continues to disappoint. 2 day order no longer exists and movies suck big time. Haven't ran across a movie I want to watch that's  ""free"" in ages. The decent titles have to be rented again on top of the price already paid for Amazon prime. Amazon prime itself is just a gimmick to make sure people use a prime seller to get free not so free order. We are stupid.",1
"fed up with amazon late shipments. this time around packages are just sitting in warehouse, but indicate as lost. 1 of 17 arrived 2 weeks later. all others are still 'lost' the issue is they do not re route packages when road closures or other hazards exist, they just keep them in warehouse, and dont report updates on them. some manager is covering there ass, and would rather tell you the package is lost. i've been waiting 2 weeks for 2 day ship packages to arrive. i'm tired of paying for amazon prime, when i do not get what i was promised and every other carrier, usps, ups, fedex, even walmart and ebay are delivering in 2-3 days if requested. all my ebay packages have come in the mail over the last 2 weeks. i'm still waiting for amazon. we should all quit amazon prime to teach these leaches that they work for us. we can all be understanding of delays. we do not expect them to be over two weeks, and to have no communications. they need managers that handle things the correct way.",0

"The point of buying necessities before a hurricane is to receive them before hurricane arrives. I ordered Friday, and it doesn't even tell me where the package is, just that it will arrive tomorrow. But I wonder how because Tuesday hurricane will be here. Honestly as a Prime Member extremely disappointed.",0
Great concept with the Prime! subscription. 1-2 days delivery almost everytime.,2
I like the convenience of it but my deliveries are constantly being delayed.,1
You pay for 2 day shipping and it gets delayed everytime. We had two different prime accts. One would show a  item for me as prime but on my husbands not prime. How is that even a thing? Worst experiences. Cancelled our prime accts.,0
Good for the most part but customer assistance can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon item or 3rd party seller,1

never a problem. and i have ordered at least 200 times with amazon. compared to ebay i really feel safe and the dealers are less dodgy. good business with you!,2

Don't get me Wrong Amazon is great for buying stuff BUT there one Flaw is Not Sponsoring NFL Games i tried to watch the Ravens and Chiefs Game with my dad today but we couldn't its not on Prime its being sponsored somewhere else i think amazon should Fix that because im not gonna pay for these other apps when i could just Watch it on Prime!!!,1
"This is absolutely ridiculous, they lose your stuff and don’t even care. I’m paying prime for what? To be messed over and roll the dice they don’t lose my package? Get real…",0
They were quick with my delivery.My second order was missed due to me not being home I was able to call and they said they always do a re-delivery up to 3 attempts.It was great I got my order on schedule.,2
"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2
Slow order! Good item!,1
"Great place to buy items if dealing directly with amazon, but had a few problems with traders!",1
Recently I ordered items based on the promise to deliver in two days being a Prime Member. However it has taken three days for the last three items to be delivered. One was promised next day order. It took two days.,1

Amazon has its decent points, but overall it really lost its ""Touch""....don't get me started with Amazon Prime Shopping assistance....it started out strong....but now....it is just plain crap!!!! Expired, rotten, thawed, broken, and open items...are just the norm now....sad! I do not see a benefit Paying for Prime anymore....",1
"Only thing so far that I don't  like about Amazon is that they usually do not deliver packages to my home. I have to go to the Post Office, which is about 15, 20, minutes from my house. ",1
"I am a Prime member and until my last 3 orders I was very satisfied. Granted it was the holidays but they are the ones that said my items would be here in 2 days, I have still only received one package and I Amazon still listed them as shipped and arriving On the 2 day mark although one wasn’t even shipped until the day I was supposed to receive it. I called them 7 times in a week and a half! They did give me some credits but mostly only on items sold and shipped by Amazon. It seemed although they were still messing up I reached a “cap” in what they would do to make it up and I had no gift for my 2 year old niece on Christmas. I will think long and hard before I renew Prime especially since the price is going up $50 a year and Walmart now ships free with no membership fees.",1
I have been shopping at Amazon for a while now and they're so great they have good prices I have never had no problem I have never had nothing back and I will shop there in the future thank you and have a great day,2
"Amazon puts a delivery date on the order, but never delivers on that date. Drivers can't read, or don't read delivery notes. They should put a realistic date for delivery and stick to it, like UPS or FEDEX.",0
"Amazon generally is good and I have been a customer for a number of years. My only gripes have been down to the size of packaging used compared to the size of the item (and the environmental impact this has) and the laziness of their drivers/couriers who often do not ring the bell when I am at home, don’t always put the package through letterbox when it would fit and instead just leave on the doorstep.",2
Zero accountability  they block you. I've been a client for almost eleven years  but I think I'm gonna leaving them. Unskilled customer service operators; their answers are useless and they are also rufe and unpolite,0

"Once upon a time Amazon was a great company.  Those days are long gone.  Greed has transformed this company and not for the better.  If you have any sort of issue with an order, you will get someone in a third world country with a script and a lack of basic comprehension skills.  That's their idea of ""support"". I tried to return something and only had the option of having UPS pick it up.  Waited all day for UPS and they never came.  I contacted Amazon yet again.... explained that UPS never showed up and my preference was to drop it off at UPS store.  I was told by the customer service idiot that I could simply drop it off to the UPS store.  WRONG.  I drove to the UPS store and was told that they could not accept my package because I had the wrong barcode and the one I gave them was for UPS pickup.   I stepped outside, contacted Amazon, got another moron w/ a script in a third world call center who couldn't help me.  I was told that they could not provide a QR code and I needed to find a printer.   So I had to drive home from the UPS store to print the barcode.  Now I get to find the time to drive yet again to the UPS store to drop the return off.How is this convenient and why should I keep paying for Prime?  Seems like Prime keeps going up and service keeps getting worse.Done with Amazon.",0
"I paid for delivery at my address and now i have to pick-up the package at the post location. I try to contact Amazom customer service, but it is impossible. I found no options to reach them. I cant recommend to buy with amazon.com. ",0
LOVE AMAZON!  Top notch company providing excellent customer service!,2
"I find amazon to be outstanding. Prime delivery is great. Customer service is great. Absolutely no messing about with refunds, straight into your account. Keep it up Jeff",2
"Literally the worst shopping experience I've had online. Account was closed for suspicious activity. Customer service is a joke, you'll get 15 different answers no one knows what's going on. You need to talk to an unreachable account specialist to get your account reinstated. Do not shop here. I lost two weeks of my life I'll never get back. Nevermind the $50 balance on my account that I'll apparently forfeit. I genuinely hope you all die a slow and painful death",0
"Prices are very high, buyers are hardly ever protected, especially international customers using freight company address for shipping-just like me. Amazon allows drop shipper sellers who are not aware what they are dispatching. If your item is not as described you are experiencing monetary loss. Regarding customer assistance: it used to be very decent back in the years but now most of them are sleepy and I even have a feeling that they did not understand English and they are using some online dictionary to see what you wrote, frequently they provide with irrelevant answers. Not all of them but most do. Amazon VS eBay-better buy on eBay, eBay has unbeatable prices at least.",1

Getting Amazon Prime was a horrible decision! I have had so many shipping problems I can't even count them. I recently ordered some tattoo supplies. I am flying to NY tomorrow. I ordered the stuff on Tues and picked free 2 day shipping. As of Thursday my stuff has still not shipped. I now have to order from another company and pay a huge overnight fee. Definitely not woth the $100+ a year. It seems the bigger they get the less they care. Everything that made them a great company is slipping away,0

Cheap price. So far not average.,1
"After complaining to customer service, I was reassured this would not happen again. ...excellent work",2
"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative usage with Amazon customer assistance over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a order date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer assistance to get a more specific order date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in order. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended usage with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
I sold on Amazon for over 10 years and their fees kept going up and up to nearly 50%. Terrible return policies that still costs the seller money when it should be on the buyer. They allow anything and everything fake be sold that could ultimately be unsafe products. Amazon takes zero moral accountability and milks it's seller fees as much as possible.,0
"Amazon is a company that just doesn’t care about its customers.As a Prime customer, I ordered a new toilet flush for next day delivery. Admittedly, it’s an odd product, but after mine broke and Amazon had it for next day delivery, I placed an order.Very late in the day on what should have been delivery day, I received a string of emails telling me delivery has been delayed by 2 days. There was no explanation or option to cancel or amend the order. It was assumed I was happy with their sloppy service.This wasn’t a junk purchase from the Prime sale, rather something essential, and an item that I desperately needed.The tracking tool on the Amazon app continued to show delivery by 10pm and the phone system by 8pm but emails still insisted there was a delay of two days.Confused, I tried the text chat service. I got nowhere. Clearly, English wasn’t the first language of the representative, and responses were the usual scripted sort. The same was the case on the phone. Offshore call centres where staff without much of a grasp of the English language tried to assist. It was a waste of time, achieving nothing.Amazon is a greedy company, focused only on making sales, and with zero regard for their customers - and especially not the obvious fools paying a £7.99 monthly premium for a Prime service.Prime membership now cancelled.",0
Bought an item off amazon that was defective. Went online and got a swap of product and I clicked the dhl pick up return. The airwave bill did not exist. Called amazon they could not help only sent me an email that directed me to another number. Called that number they said it’s the wrong amazon number and could not help. Then got sent an email to rate there service. Pressed no it said sorry your account dose not exist. First and last perchase from amazon.,0
Legit scam. Took $79 out of my bank at random without any email or pre-warning stay away from these guys!,0
Been their Prime customer since 2015. No problem at all. Always quick shipping. If it's delayed one day I usually complain and they offer refund or other credit which works for me. CS is pretty good.,2
"After contacting support with a concern, swiftly they took care of the problem! My items always are on time! Mistakes happen, and Amazon has been amazing through it all!",2
"Every time I shop here, I know for a fact I'm getting what I order within an exact period of time, if not earlier. I love reading reviews on their website, so I always leave mine too.

I ordered my wife a mother's Day present on a Wednesday it was guaranteed delivery Saturday which was before mother's Day I'll let them know Friday it was not shipped out and again they guaranteed me and said don't worry it'll be here Saturday Saturday morning I let them know it has not been shipped it's not out for delivery same as Saturday evening and Saturday night and they told me don't worry it's guaranteed it will be here today Sunday morning came which was mother's Day still has not been shipped out they want me to wait another 48 hours to file a claim they won't even let me cancel my order because they said it's getting prepared to shipped well now it's Sunday night it shipped I still can't get my refund or cancel my order my wife still has no mother's Day present thanks again Amazon this is not the first time this has happened I run an ATV business and I'm constantly getting customers complaints about me having their ATVs finished late because the parts that I ordered cannot be delivered on time even though those are guaranteed too LOL I want to try Walmart Plus it seems to be a lot better,0
Love Amazon but they really need to do something about the excessive packing which is a strain on the environment. Although the cost is great and the variety and the trustworthiness of the items and order is excellent. But all that is marred when the item is tiny and it is packed in a huge box with a lot of packing plastic/cardboard materials.,1
This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0
"The Amazon shipping practice is ridiculus.  If you purchase enough to receive free shipping without a Prime membership, they wait a week or more to actually ship the items.  This has been the consistent experience.  It is very frustrating.  I try to find a marketplace seller or check Walmart for free 2 day shipping.  Not at all satisfied with my experiences.",0
"My wife and I are dedicated Kindle fans and Amazon customers. They released the new line of Kindle's this week which made us both happy (it's the best e-reader out there and improving it even more is terrific) and a little frustrated. You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old. I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India. The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board. While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty.",2
"I spend a lot of money with Amazon but I'm getting very frustrated with the order assistance. The next day order is not helpful for me as you can't make use of the decents as they normally arrive late at night. Sometimes the order is left in full view of any passing  person who had a mind to steal the parcel. Having a large notice saying to Ring the doorbell, they often can't be bothered so you know notice of the order.For me the cost of the prime is not worth the money as I don't want music or any of the other so called perksI would take up prime at a cheaper change for order only.",1
I have bought a fair number of different items from Amazon from a television for the living room to much smaller items. Amazon sell just about everything you could want for the house or everyday use at a range of qualities and prices. The prices are normally very good prices,2
"I give Amazon a 3 out of 5 rating due to their affordable item range, which is a definite plus. However, they need to address the issues of incorrect deliveries and improve their reshipping process to provide a smoother customer interaction.",1
"Amazon has been GREAT, exceeding other retail avenues on price, shipment and customer support.  That seems to be changing.  It's getting nearly impossible to contact an actual person if you have a problem.  Over the years we get about 1 in 20 mis-deliveries. In the past you could contact them, talk to a person and either get a replacement or sometimes they could contact the carrier to find and fix a mis-shipment.   Not possible anymore as far as I can tell,  I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to break through the Barrier - getting nowhere.  I am advised by robo-support that even though they've said it's delivered... it may take up to 36 hours for it to actually be delivered.  If this support continues it will be the revival of brick and mortar shopping",1

"I used to love Amazon but ever since they started using 3rd party sellers in China we don’t get packages timely and there is no way to know where your goods is coming from. Shame on you Amazon, I am so disappointed!",1
"They were good but nowadays they are joking. There are many options for us to shop, we just need to spend some time to find the right store or site. As customers our laziness made Amazon as a big company, it is not about their product or services. The painful experience you will get from Amazon is when your item is not shipped on time or received damaged items. As they already moved to technologies business like AWS, Alexa, they don’t care about their e-commerce business. This company will go down if they operate their e-commerce business like this & that will also happen only because of customers like us.",0

Just bad.And if you’re not happy with the product or the service, you can’t leave reviews like before! You can’t say it’s late! Or didn’t arrive !

"I live on the 2nd floor of a 3 floor block . . . big problem for Amazon, the drivers are too lazy to deliver to my actual address, so just dump my parcels in reception, I'm disabled and can't get down to reception . . . and items left lying around there as stolen on a daily basis . . . . so on Amazon I clearly mark my Additional Delivery Instructions as 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' . . I then use the Security Code field to add . . 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' . . and in the 'Call Box' field I add the helpful suggestion 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' . . . and when I get an email from DPD/Amazon saying your parcel is on the way I add in the options 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION', they then send a reply email confirming my choice, with a great big 'DO NOT LEAVE IN RECEPTION' in bold letters.So then the parcel actually arrives, the driver doesn't ring the bell or knock on my door, he just dumps the parcel in reception and leaves.This would be frustrating if it happened once, but it happens all the time, the only thing I can do is to pay a local cab company to come to my flats, I let them in via the intercom and they look for the parcel, and if they find it before the local kids nick it, he brings it up to my flat . . .Anyhow, cancelling Prime today as it - quite literally - is pointless, and then closing down my Amazon account, back to eBay for me, eBay deliveries are not perfect, but orders of magnitude better than Amazon's indifferent, lazy, disinterested approach.",0

"I started receiving packages from Amazon that I did not order.  I contacted Amazon with all the information and was told several things but never received a fix.  I was told they would conduct an investigation and contact me, the first several times within 7-10 days then 24-48 hours about the fourth time.  Never received a response, was even told by customer service to view it as a golden opportunity as I was receiving things I didn't order.  I received a CC bill from my CC company that is not associated with Amazon nor on my account with several charges I did not authorized.  Obviously someone got access to my CC information and was using it but Amazon did nothing to stop this.  AT&T Universal who has my CC was outstanding, reversing all the charges and issuing me a new card.  Called Amazon again to let them know about the problem and that a fraud was taking place and they could not be less interested.  If you are receiving 9 of the same paintings, 40 steak knives, 20 bottles of soap and many other items in the same amounts someone in the Amazon fraud department should take notice.  They didn't care than and don't care now even when the CSR admits the items and amounts are obviously an attempt at fraud.  I'm good and my CC company will get their money back from Amazon and Amazon just really doesn't seem to care either way so guess they make so much money that issues like this just are not a concern.

Worst delivery service ever! I can order from Amazon.de and have it delivered faster than Amazon.nl and I live in NL! There is no excuse when what I order is through Amazon fulfillment center. Amazon.nl prices are also higher for the same item! Never again will I order from Amazon.nl!,0
"Amazon used to have international free shipping at the bottom to norway, is there any even tax on books in norway i can't remember",1
This has been a very stressful experience for my wife and her father.We ordered an adjustable bed for my father in law who was being discharged from hospital he is 73 and in ill health so he has come to live with us he can’t get in and out of a normal bed so we ordered this one from Amazon as it would be delivered earlier than others we looked at with other companies as until than his sleeping on a sofa so we really need one asap.First the bed was to be delivered between the 18th-19th Nov than it was confirmed it would be delivered on 19th that was fine I took a day off work and lost a days pay but it had to be done the bed never arrived and no word to say what was happening than that night it was updated to say it’l now be delivered between 20th-25th so I messaged customer service who apologised and said they would refund me £7.99! Personally I find that an insult after waiting in all day and as I say losing a days pay.I was very surprised by Amazon as I’ve usually found the customer service is very helpful and knowledgeable.I asked to cancel the order but apparently that’s not possible and informed I would now have to refuse delivery at the door.I couldn’t get anywhere with customer service at all so I’m now closing my Amazon account and all connected accounts and will never use them again I just feel like they couldn’t be bothered to find a solution so I will never spend my money with them again.I now need to start looking elsewhere for a bed.My father in laws physio only agreed to discharging him when she knew the adjustable bed would be here asap if she had known it wasn’t being delivered his discharge from hospital would of been delayed until it did arrive.,0

I have been an Amazon customer for years. Never an issue. In the last month about 5 of my packages have been delivered to a different apartment in my complex. Nowhere near my apt number or building. I called to complain and they changed something on the map in their system to notify the driver of where to go. I got a few packages correctly after that. But then I ordered decorations and balloons for my daughters 16th birthday. They were delivered again to the wrong address. I called to get a credit and was told I had to call back tomorrow. When I asked for the rep to follow up on it because this is inconvenient she said she couldn’t. When I asked for her to ask her boss to do it she said they can’t because they are busy with administrative work.,0
"My first buy was in 1997 on amazon.com. Amazon.it is very good as well, I just thonk some product descriptions must be improved, they should be more accurate.",2
"I love amazon for their books, their prime, customer support, and their amazing deals. 5 stars pretty much all around. Howver, regarding boots, shoes, and some other decents:While shopping for boots have you ever noticed the same model of the same brand is said to run big on one site, small on another, get 5 stars here, or three stars there? People from one site swear by this brand or this style, others have nothing but complaints? I have been in the re-sale business of shoes for several years now and have noticed several interesting quirks when researching and reselling shoes. The era of 6pm and Amazon have (unfortunately) created loopholes for customers who think they can count on a brand name (even Frye, Keen, Sorel, etc) for quality. 6pm and Amazon frequently (if not always) sell cheaper low quality versions. For example: The boots you buy from the company are all leather with a leather sole and welted construction (sole sewn to the boot) for example, but Amazon's are glued together with rubber soles. Full grain leathers are used on the company's boots, split leathers are used on the others. I don't know why the brand's allow for this blatant misuse of their names and logos (except that it must be profitable), but be aware that what you are buying through these companies will not last and is not the quality you may be expecting.",1
"Start your free trial, they say.  Then you click the button and you immediately pay $7.49/month.  So misleading.  Such a disaster of a company; for employees, for the earth, for small honest reasonable businesses.",0

"I ordered an electric rototiller on a Sunday, it shipped and said I would receive it Friday, (so I could use it for the weekend)  Amazon said it shipped out, then the next day I got an email from Amazon saying the package is being returned because it's undeliverable.  What the heck?  Then I went to check the item and the price doubled.  I've been a customer for a long time, never an issue until this, what are they trying to pull here?  Now on top of the ordered being canceled I have to wait for a refund, and I won't be able to get a tiller befor the weekend, thanks a lot Amazon!!!!",0
"I placed an order to amazon, I received us an expected very satisfied more power!",2
"Had a baby registry with Amazon, and had an item we didn't receive (even though it showed delivered in the system, not sure if it was stolen or what). Reached out to customer service, and they said they would resend the item. Never got it, nor any communication. Then reached out again over a week later and was told they had refunded the gifter and there was nothing they could do about it to make it right for me/doing anything for me. Thanks for not solving a simple customer problem over some diapers Amazon....really means a lot after being a dedicated Prime member for decades.",0
"I am really disappointed with Amazon.  I have been a loyal customer for the last 6 years.  Have made several orders.  Once I ordered a laptop and the screen was broken.  I had no way of getting a refund.  They over charged me for orders for Sales tax and delivery during the pandemic, and now I'm locked out of my account. I tried calling customer service but they couldn't solve me issue. They never appreciated me as a loyal customer after all these years.  I think I'm done with them.  I have never felt so disappointed and abandoned.",0
I ordered an action camera from Amazon on Wednesday. It said One day delivery. I needed in one day or at worst two days as I purchased it to take on my honeymoon to Hawaii. It made it from TN to my state of NC overnight and showed out for delivery the next morning. I then get a message that my delivery is delayed and it will be Friday or Saturday before my package arrives. I leave Saturday morning at 7am for my honeymoon. As it stands it’s Friday night and it hasn’t showed up. I am now forced to cancel my order. I called customer support and filed a complaint. I cancelled my Prime membership (as it is obviously useless) and I will be closing my Amazon Prime Visa. For a company as big as Amazon this is unacceptable.,0
I ordered a item I paid premium delivery to receive the parcel by 10.pm the same day I got a email  from amazon in the evening to say the parcel was delivered and handed to resident  this did not happen it was left in the rain outside the passage door i didn't come across it not until the next day,0
Ordered a hand held laser for pain relief represented as a new instead got a previously purchased open box product. Amazon is getting worse with terrible quality control. This is the third time something such as this  has occurred in the previous four months across twenty purchases.,0
"Only thing so far that I don't  like about Amazon is that they usually do not deliver packages to my home. I have to go to the Post Office, which is about 15, 20, minutes from my house. ",1
"I never received my order, Amazon's incompetent courier driver had delivered it to another address on the apartment complex I live in. I was emailed to say the item had been delivered through my letter box but it hadn't, so can only assume it went elsewhere?? I contacted Amazon and spoke to what I thought was a compassionate advisor (Sashaneal.S.) she promised to call me on the 17th Jan as she advised she wasn't able to offer an immediate refund but would be able to do so within 48 hours (on this date) I never received the call and cannot be bothered to go through the whole ordeal again, so now I have been left out of pocket due to two incompetent Amazon staff! Great service Amazon! I've been a prime member for a while now and I'm seriously considering cancelling my subscription with them. The calibre of staff is decreasing, I had an Amazon delivery posted through my letter box the week before, which was intended for the floor above me. I would rather buy from the stores and pay a little more than buy from Amazon and end up without my order and out of pocket!",0
Service is excellent and all merchandise lives up to its description.,2
Amazon is quick and easy shopping with a lot of items for sale except liquor and smokes.,2
Ordered the VCR /DVD combo for a great price. Was told shipping would be three days and it end up being five. Overall acceptable usage.,1
"My go to place. I’m handicapped, getting out to shop is very difficult and aggravating. Amazon allows me to shop for myself, feel independent and have fun all in the comfort of my chair. Then it’s quickly delivered to my door. Amazon let’s me be somewhat independent in not having to rely on my sons to gather items for me. Amazon let’s me feel like less of a burden.",2
"I like the availability of many reviews for products -- this helps my purchasing decision. i also like the variety of products available, especially the affordable options + used marketplace.Purchasing process is also relatively straightforward (although I could always do with fewer forms to fill/pages to click through!).I just wish international shipping was much more reasonable. the Amazon Singapore product selection is way too limited to be attractive.",2
Yesterday I bought kids rubberband for 280 rs.The way the item is showed in the image was satisfactory for me.But today when I got delivered it was too small.Not happy with the item.Shining Diva fashion is the item name ,1
"I will not buy from Amazon again..Missing items in package, then they ask for proof of missing item (how the hell do you do that 🙄)  refund process is far too long, (doesn't take long for them to collect the payment though) and very tiresome.. never again ",0
"Clearly, Amazon plays a role in our online shopping experience and drives competition. However, Amazon/Prime, their customer service and the management of their vendors has failed dramatically.They are no longer reputable, they fire employees for speaking up and standing up, and they do not live up to the promised core values.Prime is not a deal at all when you are promised nest day and get items 2 weeks later.",0
"My account has been hacked!I am a long time user of Amazon. Today someone changed my email address.  I did receive an email about the change from Amazon, 6:18am this morning.  I replied stating I did not authorize any changes.  It is now 3:37pm and I am still awaiting a response.(I also tried to call but the wait is over 1 hour!)  I also sent a message through the website, but also no response.I had to cancel my credit card along with having to update automatic payments. What a mess!",0
"Normally I don’t have problems with Amazon! But these last 3 times have been utterly freaking ridiculous. I asked to have my package thrown over my fence. Twice now my package has been left on my doorstep. I even put a note on my door and nope! So today, I got an alert my package was dropped off. I go to my backyard. No package. I go to my front yard nothing. I even see the Amazon driver on my security camera and nothing. Checked outside the gate nothing. So I reached out to Amazon. Guess what, I have to wait 24hrs to report my package missing because sometime the drives mark packages are dropped off even though they are not. Utter bs! Go back to shopping in stores people!",0
"I use to swear by Amazon, but now I have zero respect for there business. The countless times my package instructions were ignored and left out in the open for all to see and steal. The countless times I reported fraud / scammers using their site for profit and not giving refunds or stealing peoples identities. They use foreigners from another Country who sometimes can't even speak clear English or won't escalate your call to a Manager or give a number to an American speaking person. They don't even have a Corporate number to contact or an email to file a complaint, but sure they love immediately taking your money out, but refuse to fix the problems plagued with their customer service and package delivery methods!",0
I had to call customer service to get a location on my package. They were holding it at a carrier location to be picked up. They gave me the wrong address twice before I asked the name of the place they are held at only for it to be a different address then what they gave to me.,0
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, goodss are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with goodss directly from Amazon, I find their supports lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1
"Purchased a Honor Magic6 Lite mobile phone which was advertised with a FREE Honor Pad8.  Phone arrived but NO PAD. Contacted Amazon who stated there was a mistake in the listing and that the offer had expired.  FALSE ADVERTISING WHICH THEY REFUSE TO CORREC. Offer on listing states: ""Buy the new Magic6 Lite and get the PadFrom 17 Jan. 2024 to 26 Mar. 2024""",0
the buy and shipment is decent. but lately i reviewed some goodss that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing decent to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
"I have spent most of my money on Amazon- purchasing necessities for home and work. My account had fraud on it several times PRIOR to COVID-19 regulations or anyone identified with Corona Virus in the US. I did what Amazon told me to do- implement a two-step authorization when I log in. I was told someone from Amazon Fraud Dept would contact me. I removed all of my payment methods with the exception of my Amazon store card. I cancelled my debit card. When yet another fraud happened, I cancelled my Amazon Store Card. Fraud continued to happen. I am locked out of my own account and receiving multiple emails from Amazon demanding payment for fraudulent purchases on an inactive card. Are you kidding me? I wholeheartedly believe this is an inside job- and I have proof that will come out in court. In the world we live in right now, I don’t want this headache in my life. This long term member is navigating an Amazonless life just fine. I had however, better be granted access to my history, I will not pay for fraudulent charges and this needs to be done in a timely manner. SHAME on AMAZON. Liars, cheats and thieves that wouldn’t recognize true customer service if it stared them in the face. GROSS.",0
I am usually a huge amazon fan!  reason for only 4 stars is that sometimes their returns process is frustrating!  I am sure dealing with all the returns they must receive on a daily basis must be frustrating for this company as well tho!,2
On top of terrible automated service you treat your employees terribly. You are abelist and cancel insurance for your disabled employees while refusing employees the ability to be on LTD. You have an employee dying of cancer because you won't approve her LTD despite her recent cancer diagnosis. You are disgusting and benefit off of slavery. Your operation should be shut down. ,0
"Don’t ever use Amazon.es! Faulty items that Amazon does not want to take responsibility for even though it was Amazon that sold and delivered it. I bought some baby items well in time for the baby’s arrival. I had a quick look to see if everything was there and it looked fine but obviously didn’t put it up including a travel cot/changer as I wasn’t due any time at that point, I got it early just in case as you never know when the baby decides to come. When I did get to put it all up, there was a clip missing to hold the changer up safely onto the cot, this is something I would t know was missing without the whole thing up and reading instructions etc. I contacted Amazon and they shrugged it off saying the policy is complain within 30 days. This isn’t realistic for this sinario but they didn’t want to know. I only wanted the missing item! I didn’t want a refund or a return, I just wanted the clip which I am unable to buy separately. They didn’t care and didn’t want to know!! It’s so black and white with Amazon and will use anything to avoid responsibility and to compensate a faulty item! I might as well paid a lot less for the same item as I am unable to use the other aspects. It’s now just a travel cot. I paid €110 for a travel cot!!! Don’t bother! Go to a shop or use a different online sight!",0
"My moan is about the shipment assistance provided by their Enfield (North London) Delivery Depot.Amazon Tracking states that packages leave their depot around NOON, yes noon.Most of my orders are delivered to my local 'locker' which happens to be within a Post Office which, on a Saturday, closes at 3 pm!!!!! Should I have a shipment to home the drivers have a tendency to tap on the glass in and surrounding the front door (which rarely I can hear), why I have no idea because there are TWO working doorbells which would be impossible to miss.",1
"Amazon is a fine platform i buy so many things like charger, shirts, shoes but sometimes my interaction is ordinary sometimes my interaction is to fine ",1
"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music support, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new support at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new support at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
great items at great prices with fast delivery,2

"Honestly, I had purchased on Amazon before and I never had problems with any of my orders. But recently, I decided to purchase shoes on Amazon and I had the most stressful experience. When I ordered my shoes, I kept tracking it and everything was going well and I liked how Amazon always tells you when your shipment will arrive. On the day my shipment was suppose to arrive, i checked my tracking information and it said it was being sent back to seller with no explanation. When I reached out to the seller he explained to me he didn't know why either and that id receive a refud. I was very annoyed and confused but I gave amazon another chance because like I said before, I have had good experiences with Amazon. So I decided to just purchase the same shoes from another seller on Amazon and when I did everything was going well until on the day the shipment was suppose to arrive AGAIN. On this day, I logged on to check my tracking info and it said UPS was unable to deliver my package. I contacted an Amazon Agent and they told me that my address was incomplete and I needed to contact UPS to complete it. Mind you my product was delivered and at a UPS near me. When I contacted UPS to complete my address they told me that it was a huge change of address if I completed it,So UPS told me to contact Amazon to complete the address. when I spoke to another Amazon Agent they said they couldn't complete my address either because the carrier had the product. At this point I'm calling UPS and Amazon back and forth to complete my address and no one can do it. Finally UPS told me I could pick it up at the UPS ware house but I needed an ID. And I couldn't pick it up because I always use a Nickname online shopping. If Amazon could have told me my address was incomplete as soon as I purchased my product, I would not have gone through all of this. That was the most stressful online experience I've ever had at that point I just canceled my order.",0
"In general i think their deliveries are a little slow and although they are cheap , they're not the cheapest. But for reliablity and overall quality of service you can beat them.",2
"Do not, I repeat do not order here.This company is one of the if not the worst.I've been a customer for 10 years. Never had any issue.Until I had an issue. Just before Christmas. Amazon's solution to ANY problem? We ""will,"" (they wont) call you back tomorrow. This can go on for weeks depending if you get someone on the phone who cares about their 10 cent a hour job ( outsourced callcenter)  Then if you finally get your order , IT WONT EVEN BE YOUR ORDER, And guess what return process takes atleast 2 weeks.And I am not even speaking of the endless documentation requested to prove account ownership when you buy something expensive. As of this day amazon is still holding over a 1000 euro hostage in refund and will call me any day now ( yeah no) Tldr (to long didn't read)You are safer replying to Nigerian scam mails than by shopping with Amazon.",0
One stop shop where I can get anything I need with a tap of a mouse. And if I'm having trouble making a decision on purchase the reviews are always spot on.,2
Bye Amazon. Didnt use a lot 5-8 times a year. I dont deal with unethical companies such as yours.,0
Got electric scooter don't work the morons at Amazon said send it back by royal mail don't take stuff with batteries so they better pick it up I want my 290Quid back don't want that doesn't work,0
"The return process is a rip-off! I bought something and it was much larger than expected.  I wanted to return it.  During the process, I had a couple of options, first print my own return label in which the charge was over 13 Dollars!  Expletive (I can't use bad language)! 13 Dollars to print your own return label!!! The second was just to drop it off for free at the UPS store.  I had used the latter method before and it took well over two months to get a partial refund.  I never got a full refund.  Calling the service center took such a long time on the phone with someone who barely spoke English. On my current return, they said it would take over a month to ""process"" the return!  Expelitive! In years past, I would get a refund once the item was scanned in at the UPS center.  Why are they holding my money for so long?!  I have been an Amazon shopper for years.  I think that in the future I  will be looking to other online retailers.",0
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the shipment. Then they give you an approximate shipment date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1
"I have been Waiting for an IPad with Cover for 4 days, it was suppose to be a Same day delivery!! The driver said at 5 am the next day, that he was at my door and could not deliver my order becuz I didn’t answer and said it was a business and he couldn’t get in!! I told a live customer service agent that was BS becuz if he had been at my door knocking I would have heard it as my screen door is metal!! 2 days later still No IPad!! I finally Cancelled my order and waiting for my Refund. This was a delivery from the Burlington NJ Warehouse!!",0

"If I could give amazon zero stars I would. This company was once good. Its now terrible.  Ordered a motorcycle jacket nowhere near the correct size. Sent the jacket straight back 2 weeks later still no refund , customer services are as much good as a chocolate fire guard.

"Generally okay in my interaction. My only real issue is the stupid ""Try now pay later"" Wardrobe system. They took money out of my account instantly and i was told it would be refunded within 5-10 days. What is the point in the system if i'm just going to be charged straight away? I'm not gonna use the system if i had the money to pay for it there and then, am i? If i wasn't to be refunded until the 10th day then i'm effectively paying for the item twice until the refund is issued. The scheme, to me, just sounds like I'm giving Amazon a small loan. Bloody stupid.",1
"Amazon is a total joke. They delete my orders, I can't find them anymore and I can not make any returns either. I call customer service and the lady sounded like she had an Asian accent. I couldn't understand a single word she was saying and she seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. The other thing is that they happen to steal $100 from my account for Amazon Prime and temporarily disable my account. They wouldn't even let me cancel it.",0

Its hit and miss with Amazon. I've had acceptable and ordinary interactions,1
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a shipment, they take away the packaging from their last shipment and use it again.",1
"Goods always delivered quickly and as described. Comminication is excellent. On the one problem I had with a faulty camera when it was still in warranty, they replaced it immediately.",2

"Amazon was at one time a brilliant service, now im afraid its gone downhill and getting worse.1 Poor delivery service2 Constant failed deliveries3 Customer services that lie to you4 Constantly having to chase up deliveriesI ordered 4 items recently, due to past delivery issues I opted for locker delivery and that also turned out to be a mistake.One of the items was missing and the traking showed as attempted delivery failed and would be delivered that day.Sadly Item never got redelivered, contacted Amazon who assured me the iten would be deliverd in the next 24 hrs.They offered me a refund on the item and as a gesture of goodwill said when the item arrives the next day I could keep it and have it for free.Cant say I was suprised when the item never turned up anyway.This has happened frequently and the need to chase orders is more common.To be fair the prime subscription is a waste of money as they very rarely deliver as promised and quite often the next day delivery turns ito 2 days or not at all.Overall useless drivers and customer service that tell you lies.",0

"Amazon can't give me access to my account. I have got a new phone number and I cannot access the account to change my phone number, as the two-factor security requires me to type in a code which Amazon sends to my old phone number.

However, Amazon requires me to log in to my account to accept that the account is closed :-(",0

"What a garbage company, glacially slow order processing and shipping even before the corona virus. Orders being marked as shipped even though they haven't. Zero customer support and it's a 1000% worse if you are a seller.

the worst streaming service eversupport is useless and don’t even try to help,0
"I have been a Prime member of Amazon.com for probably well over ten years. Unfortunately, I have seen a significant decline in customer service and not meeting delivery dates in the past year. I find it very insulting when Amazon promises a delivery date, they can't deliver until three days later. When I communicate with them on the chat facility and asked them to cancel the order. The response is for me to call UPS and tell them not to deliver. Seems strange that I am the person inconvenienced by their inability to deliver on time and now they expect me to be further inconvenienced by having to call UPS. Last week I had another late delivery with their own delivery company and was told it would take around two weeks for them to get the package back and refund the payment. What I don't understand is the package was in their control the entire time. Why the delay. I've recently started to use Walmart for delivery and not only are the prices a little less than Amazon, but every delivery has also been on time.",0

"Like many people I have used Amazon quite often over the years and although the assistance is generally quite fine, shipment does tend to let them down during both peak and off peak periods.  I cannot fault however the downloads, especially the ebooks. Fast, efficient, simple!",1
I like this platform . It’s easy to use and it keeps you updated . The problem sometimes comes from shipment . Some shipment persons don’t follow instructions and leave packages unintended on the floor were all passbyers can take package and steal it . It started to happen more often .,1
Great both as a seller and a buyer,2
"What is happening at Amazon? I have used them for YEARS and generally speaking they have been very good.However, I recently placed an order on an item that said  it would arrive in 2 days. When it didn't and I contacted customer services they said it would not be the Friday I was expecting it, but the following Friday, a week late.The member of staff I was in contact with, you know, the soulless call centre type, just kept repeating they knew how I felt and the item is on its way. I asked to cancel order, but they said I could not do that.Total RUBBISH!",0
"Pricing may not always be the best, but it's competitive. Goods selection is stellar. Deliveries are on time 99% of the time. Customer service is outstanding.  They always resolve in my favor and are willing to spend as much time as it takes. They definitely go the extra mile.",2
"Amazon puts a delivery date on the order, but never delivers on that date. Drivers can't read, or don't read delivery notes. They should put a realistic date for delivery and stick to it, like UPS or FEDEX.",0
"Poor service will be closing my account when I get my refund, ordered laptop which didn’t arrive amozan have taken the money for it. When I rang customer services they advised it will take 2 more days. After asking for refund they said it will take up to 7 working days. Poor service from manager I spoke to, taken day of work to stay home for my laptop as it was a gift. No good will gesture. Indian customer service representative clueless.",0
"It's OK, but you're just giving Bezos more money.",1
Eveything that I have ordered from Amazon has been great.  The company makes returns easy and will continue to shop with them.,2
"I sent an item that was under warranty back to Amazon for a refund six weeks ago...After six weeks I had to contact them looking for my refund.. I spoke with a rep that assured me that my money was on its way back to me immediately and all was good..... Not so... Further week later still no refund and now still waiting... A disaster   ... I wouldn't recommend Amazon because their refund policies are crap, and they lie about making such refunds in a timely manner..",0
"If I could have gave no starts, I would have. I’m only writing a bad review because of Amazon’s customer service. I’ve never spoken with so many rude people in my life. They honestly don’t care about their customer’s needs as long as they’re making money. I was using Amazon on a regular basis. I’m a prime member. Now I will be looking for alternative vendors. I’m so disappointed.",0
"I recently reviewed my bank statement and noticed chsrges for Amazon subscriptions that I did Not authorize. After further review o noticed that they had been charging my account for many months in 1 case 1 subscriptions was more that 8 months. After asking to have this unauthorized subscriptions canceled and to be reimbursed i was told that they would only reimburse me for 3 months🤦‍♀️ They've been taking money from me for over 10 months on 2 accounts and you're only gonna reimburse me for 3 months...they are ""stealing"" money from me. This is Not the 1st time that ive had a problem with Amazon and unauthorized subscriptions. After the 1st time i started checking my Amazon account on a more frequent basis to ensure thst i didn't have this problem again...i know that i didn't do it monthly but goodness this is crazy. Also I'm a Prime member and 1 of the charges was for Prime music...a ""benefit"" to being a Prime member is Prime Music but they tried to say maybe i ""searched"" for music that wasn't included with Prime. I Don't use Prime for any type of mysic because i have Sirius XM. Im frustrated, disappointed and upset. Im doing this review so that other Prime members can be alerted to Amazon Shenanigans and how they are ""Stealing""",0
"Amazon was always my go to, mainly because of the 2 day shipping. The order times have been very inconsistent for the past few months and a few items were canceled even though notifications were sent that the merchandise was out for order. Seriously considering not renewing my prime membership...",1
This is honestly one of the most gross things that have happened to me while ordering Amazon fresh I ordered mayo 20 FL OZ and it came it I have started opening my package and the state of the mayo was just oil with chunks of white s hit that looked like semen I shook the bottle to see a big blob the bottle was unopened still having it's seal didn't expire until September 17 2022 idk what temperature they keep there food in but it's obviously the wrong fuc king temperature to be sending out s hit like that that get the order two hours before delivery time and can't even realize they grabbed and bagged a disgusting looking mayo to be sent out,0
"The store needs a total overhaul, function is LOST in search and sort. The site CHANGES DEPARTMENTS when advancing to the next page of results, which also changes your results. There must be no management whatsoever on navigation and how the store functions. It is not worth the prime membership anymore. The people in charge at amazon clearly do not care.",0
I think that Amazon has excellent customer service!  ty!!,2

The generate billions of UK revenue but pay very little tax due to their offshore structure.  I shop at other places where I can now.,0
"Secure reliable company to deal with,only slight downside is the high delivery charges and non specific delivery dates.",2
"I am getting frustrated , I make purchases through Amazon for convenience and based on shipment times & dates and I do not think that Amazon sellers nor Amazon as a retail venue should advertise they can deliver ""same day"" , ""next day"" or even ""Prime shipment"" when they CANNOT fulfill the transaction according to the terms when the item(s) were ordered . This happens more times than not , it's aggravating and that is the point of this review !",1
"Would you please fix your search engine?  Perhaps Google could help.

I have 2 battery orders sitting here that are useless to me because they popped up in a search where they shouldn't have.  Some of these button batteries have several names.

Hello my name is mike green I am contacting you because I have been dealing with multiple issues at my amazon facility in am currently a level 1 employee at las 1 henderson nv.I am a very motivated associate who is eager to learn and grow in this company.I have spoken to many floor managers that I would like to be enrolled into any and all trainings/classes that would help me advance my career. My managers tell me they submit my tickets I check in with learning and nothing ever seems to exsist on my behalf. I am one of the most efficent and hard working employees in las 1 dock receive. I always take the initiative to do what needs to be done without being told I drop whatever im doing  instantly when a manager needs me to do something. And yet employees that do not work near as hard as I do get enrolled in classes and receive promotions to pg or pa. I was told hard workers in this company have many chances and ways to advance but I have not been given any opportunity.I have discussed all of this with multiple ops managers floor managers pg's and pa's yet nothing is ever done.I have worked so well in one days I recieved a total of 13 raffles for my work performance and yet I still do not get recognized for any of my additional trainings I have even helped a training ambassadors train a class and employees but cant get my self trained or certified i would really love to be trained and certified in every department here at las 1 if possible.Patrice was one of my trainers and senior managers that motivated me with her story of her story and  advancements in the company when I heard her speak in knew I wanted to follow in her footsteps but my management team is not helping with these cituations at all some of these managers tell me thank you mike your making our job easier or they say mike can you slow down your making some of us look ordinary or work a little harder.Just recently I helped my team hit record on out shift that we have never ever hit before. So please if there is anything you could do it would be highly appreciated.,1
I'm always really happy when I purchase goods from Amazon..they are packaged well..delivered quickly..updated on deliveries and the drivers are polite.,2
"Get so fed up with Amazon.  I pay annually for the 'privilege' of free next day delivery etc. Nine times out of 10 I get to checkout and find that the goods offered as next day delivery could actually be any number of days, even weeks away.  Today I've been waiting for a small package which should be delivered by 10pm, it's now 9.20pm and tracking shows it's not even despatched!  Amazon customer dis-service robot says it will  be delivered today although they only have the same information that I  have. Tomorrow I  shall receive the usual ""it's been delayed"" email from Amazon and I  will refuse to take delivery when it eventually arrives. There's no compensation for lost or delayed items, we pay for a poor, unwieldy service.   Not good enough Amazon!",0
Awful customer service. We ordered 2 smart watches costing £480 and received disney against humanity card game costing £17 in their place. We were asked to return the card game which we did expecting a refund for the items we did not receive. We have now been told we will not receive a refund until January 2024. These items were supposed be christmas presents. Very disappointed 😞,0
this item makes my day easy as these are very helpful,2
Always get my order fast and with zero problems. Thankful for Amazon!,2

I have ordered with Amazon around 40 times always a good experience!!,2
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, items are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with items directly from Amazon, I find their assistances lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1
Excellent service totally reliable in contrast to Boots. See review of online service there!!,2
Will not order from them again and I will and have started a civil suit against them for Failure To Deliver as promised as expected reasonably upon purchasing. I find them a disgusting disgraceful company that should be out of business for bad business practices. ,0
"UPS ,in error, returned my generator to Amazon. I received notice of delivery from UPS had received shipment. Amazon won't return my generator. Amazon agrees they accepted delivery. For a month I have spoken with numerous supervisors and when I push them for a determination as to the generators location, they place me on hold until the phone goes dead. Clearly, this is an internal policy to avoid responsibility. I am a 78 year old widower, with cancer. I live alone and need the generator to insure that my home medical services work. These are the most callus, uncaring group of customer service representatives I've ever met.",0
The only shopping service i use... always the best option,2
"Absolutely no service after the sale!!!  They continue to take your annual prime membership dues of $125. But have used Covid as an excuse to delay their promised 2 day delivery times. Well over a year and still delayed delivery times! Now it’s even worse. Weeks on products that used to be delivered in 2 days. How about we all cancel our annual membership to show mr trillionaire Bezos he cant continue to charge for a promised service that he clearly is not delivering. Our annual membership cost shouldn’t be cut in half since most of us signed up for Prime membership to get stuff in 2 days as promised! Bottom line, Bezos getting even richer bc our annual prime membership cost have stayed the same, but our product gets delivered when amazon sees fit. So he’s saving a ton of money on expedited shipping, but our cost haven’t changed!",0
great service and great store i like their sales where you can find anything.,2

"I would never expect such a global company to have such a cheap and absolutely disappointing customer service representative's communication. The waiting time was over whole ONE HOUR, I could not believe it. And The customer representative had a very poor English which took me hours to understand what she was trying to explain me, furthermore, she did not know what she was doing, kept putting me on hold to reply to every single question I asked. I hope I will never have to deal with amazon customer service again. Horrible! SHAME! SHAME! SHAME AMAZON!",0
"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day order was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the goods.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day order is bs.  I’ve had several two-day order packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the order would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day order mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the goodss sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1
"I simply love Amazon, I have been a customer now for 3 years, I have bought a mixture of things, never had a problem and have been satisfied with their service, the prime is the best, get my goods next day, plus with my subscription I get prime video, music and free reads on books. I have found nearly everything I want on their site. From door locks, lighting, wallpaper, grass seed, bedding, towels to fashion and make up. Its just so super easy, everything is well packaged and I have never returned anything. I must have ordered more than 200 items so far, happy with them all. So keep up the good work x",2
"I love Amazon, for the assistances they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the goodss or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' interactions. Typical corporate America. No matter how many acceptable things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
"I was waiting for 3 small craft items to arrive to do a project none of which have arrived....Amazon's reasoning "" A POSTAL STRIKE"" I did make enquiries just in case there is NO postal strikes and haven't been since July....now trying to get a refund from Amazon usually do not have many issues but lately its been one thing after another , items left on doorstep and getting nicked, items not turning up, wrong item sent and items broken due to the carelessness of the couriers. I have now cancelled my Prime membership and I shall elsewhere just a little fed up now with it all.",0
Some of the best customer service of any company I’ve ever purchased from.,2
"Amazon cancelled all my recent orders due to a ""security concern"" that they thought someone else had accessed my account - they did not, and these were orders I personally placed on Amazon, but their security system is too stupid to know the difference. Now I am struggling going back and forth between the BBB and the Amazon Executive Account Team.Get rid of your damn ""security"" system if it is stopping people from doing legitimate business on your website!Edit for Update: Amazon restored my order that was canceled. Rating increased because my order was restored to my account, but customer assistance was very unhelpful. 3 stars at most only because of the headache it caused me trying to get it fixed.",1
"I ordered a mobile phone for my father (I have prime membership so get deliveries faster).The next day I get a message saying that the driver attempted delivery and would have to redeliver, which was odd as due to the lock down both of my parents are isolating and were therefore at home.  Not a big deal only one more day to wait.The package was delivered the next day.  After two more days (my parents put all their deliveries into a two day quarantine atm) my father opened the package and inside was a packet of ground coffee and no phone... luckily due to problems in the past he photos every package before he opens them (I think I will start doing the same after this), and upon further inspection the seal had clearly been tampered with.I used the live chat service to contact Amazon, and was expecting a difficult time, but the opposite was true.  The customer service rep (Joy) was really helpful, and after answering all her questions and emailing her the photos she quickly spoke to her manager, and arranged for a replacement to be delivered the next day!I think its only fair to give Amazon credit where it is due, (I have reviewed them low for a bad experience prior to this) most people are quick to give a low review but not so when things go well.If anyone from Amazon reads this - thank you for your help today.",2
"I've been a Prime member for many years. It's not perfect but I find Customer assistance is quick to resolve missed deadlines and defective decents. My only complaint is a lot of sellers are selling expired decents. So my advice is to check the dates on everything and contact customer assistance if you've received old goodss. It's true some reps are difficult to deal with but just keep escalating until you get results.Prime Video is another issue altogether. I refuse to pay extra fees for ""no commercials""This is a ridiculous money grab since a lot of content you can get for free on other non subscription channels.The above reasons are why I'm giving Amazon a 3 star rating. IMO they can do better!",1
I think Amazon could take a leaf out of Ebays ebook when it comes to navigation/listing/cataloging etc. It's irritating to browse.,1

"No proper complaints procedure. The customer is not valued, and customer service is non-existent. Items go missing, returns are problematic, refunds are promised, but never delivered. The couriers damage the parcels without care. The products are often cheaper elsewhere. I don't know what I was thinking of when signing up to their free trial because the missing items were far from free. It was a learning experience and the lesson learned was don't use Amazon.",0
"After complaining to customer assistance, I was reassured this would not happen ... Amazon customer care number.....",1
"There is a lot of variety of things, and the search is very convenient, I have a long time want to buy things here I found, this is my second purchase this week",2
I used to be a prime number half of the stuff never was within two or three days it was the same difference as not being a prime member. Recently I purchased a couple of doorbell hardwired kids only one was delivered and I tried to get customer service to expedite shipping on the other one and they couldn’t do anything they said. My experience with customer service has been so poor enough times that I’m actually considering giving up Amazon altogether.,0
"I ordered an Xbox one S controller and they sent me an Xbox series S controller. I tried to contact customer support but it was hard to understand them due to a language barrier. They asked me to write a review and I did exactly that. They read it and refused to post it because I got scammed by one of their top sellers. Now I know to never purchase a controller from them ever again. They will not send you want you paid for, but instead you'll get what they want you to have.",2
"They are about the worst thimf ever most corrupt idiotic people I’ve ever come in contact with. Jeff Bezos is a narcissist and let all the money he made go to his head. The site is inoperable for the most part and when it is operable and you can actually place an order don’t expect to get what you ordered or get it when you expected it. You will get the wronf items with no customer care to back it up . The customer care chat is only available in the app and it malfunctions. Though it malfunctions, the people who respond also have noAccess to actually assist with anything . They just want to call you and waste moreTime. Who would do this except a narcissist ? Who would have rules like this ? Also in spite of all the times their company is messed up in other accords, the weird thing was my account was blocked because of me using it. So I used to a few other times before and got poor service so I quit using it but someone wanted a gift card so I sent them one and the account was LOCKED because they thought it was fraud even tho it came fromMy IP address. So I do I like chat like I say they people there are of no use they just want me to call. This was for a friends birthday . Time is sensitive in this regard . Wake up",0
Four orders total. One was wrong. one was half wrong.. Ask tons of questions before placing an order..,1
Once again overnight shipping is going to take up to 4 days. Birthday present that I will not have in time! Can’t cancel till 4 days are up! Typical Amazon lies!,0
Be carful on Amazon drivers . They are opening in them self your back yard and come in to garden with out your permission. Next driver has stated has delivered  parcel to customer into hands when customer was not at home ! Over phone costumer service are not knowledgeable and you as a customer is not able speak with management to solve an issue.,0

"Amazon has stolen so much of my time, money, and energy from me and if I can do business with anyone else, I will. First, my account was deleted with no notice, along with all my wish lists that I spent hours organizing and adding to, all my account credits, all my order history, and all my gift cards, all my kindle books, and my 5 months of kindle unlimited free Bc I had just bought a kindle and signed up for unlimited. All gone. $500 and countless hours, all gone. I’ve spent HOURS on the phone with “customer service” and they simply can’t do sh** except offer me $5 which they still haven’t done. They can’t even do that! Ha! What a joke of a business. I had an account in Spain when I lived there and that’s the account I wanted to cancel. Not my US one. And the only reason I went to cancel it was Bc I got an email from Amazon music saying I had 3 months free based off a recent order I placed in AMERICA and when I went to use it, it said I couldn’t Bc There’s no amazon music in SPAIN. So obviously things were getting tangled and I wanted to get rid of Spain account so I could use amazon music on American account. I called amazon “customer service” before doing so trying to find out why that happened and if I cancelled nothing would happen to American account. They assured me accounts were not linked at all. So I cancelled. And 2 weeks later I get an email saying EVERYTHING is gone. And now it’s all apparently in cyber space and they can’t get it back. No emails, nothing in those 2 weeks verifying if I want to cancel my account. NOTHING. It’s just gone one day. Oh well. Nothing they can do. Amazon I hope you get lost in cyber space you piece of sh**. And then when I go to create a new account, it’s recommending me products based off recently sold items from my old account!! So how is it that they can’t recover my account but Amazon knows what I last bought in my old account?? WT*?! AND SO NOW, today, 3 months after this sh** went down, I received an Amazon gift card and went to add it to my account and get back on my kindle that I haven’t been able to read on much yet Bc amazon is a piece of sh**, and I immediately get locked out of my account. And to get back in, I need to send in a copy of my gift card reciept. I don’t have my gift card receipt Bc I didn’t buy my gift card bc it was a gift!!!!! AHHHHHH! And so I called “customer service” and they said it could be up to Tuesday until my account isn’t on hold anymore. Today is Friday. All I wanted to do was read a f****** book. F you amazon. F you. You owe me. I hope you get a million competitors and go out of biz. You don’t deserve to be in biz you piece of sh**.",0
"Amazon themselves are not average, but the order drivers they hire all seem to be incompetent, I am constantly having packages delivered to wrong addresses, left in unsecure places despite giving explicit instructions on where to leave them, resulting in stolen packages, prime deliveries not arriving next or same day as promised, trying to deliver to a business address that has clearly marked opening hours late evening when it's closed and failing to attempt re-order at all iver the following days, I've lost count if how many packages I've had to ckaim a refund on because they simply never arrive, a company is only as strong as its weakest link, and deliveries are a very weak link",1
"I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!",2
AMAZON I DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR GAY PRIDE CELEBRATION SO DO NOT SEND ME ONE MORE GAY PRIDE NOTICE!!! ONE MORE AND IM DONE WITH YOU.,0
"Again, one more time and maybe the million, Amazon confused the delivery status and mark the order as delivered while it's not!! This time is delivery to Amazon lockers under Amazon prime. The tracking page shows it's delivered while the order page shows undelivered. Moreover I didn't receive the locker code. Confusion and frustration. not the first time, not the second  not even the tenth!! To put facts together, the order number is 113-8438196-4651453Do you want more order numbers? Personally the delivery failure and confusion is up 20% with me.",0
"Order today get it tomorrow is woderful.  Sometimes I think  I may never have to leave the house again.  I have never been disappointed , Amazon does exactly what it promises every time.",2
"I called customer service because I was having a payment method issue. After explaining my issue, the person says well there's nothing we can do you need to do it. I am like wait I am adding a new payment method, I did that online and it won't let me utilize the payment method. I was again told I need to do it, after 3 back and Forths, I asked for a manager, the manager gets on the phone and verifies my info but called me by my name initially. I explained the problem again. She said we cannot help you. I asked why she said we don't know how we have never been trained. I said you have not been trained on how to set up a new default payment method. She said no Amazon has a history of failing in the training. I said who can i speak to, I do not know was her reply. So we have a either she was straight up lying to a customer or Amazon fails in training either way to say things like this to a customer whose company spent 236k in the last 3 years with them is extremely poor customer service. I will take my business elsewhere.",0
Well I'm not happy with Amazon and I won't be robbed by them again goodbye Amazon account,0
Jersa mae Thanks for your support. Amazon is a best website to use it and get the items very fast.Good customer service amazing staff. Mr Jersa mae wonderful person handling customer solutions and very polite. Am soo thankful amazon for delivering the product fast and wonderful staff handling the customer kind. Once again thanks Mr jersa mae,2
"Have ordered from Amazon UK no less than 5 times in the past 6 months and have received my products each time in good condition, with regular updates and fairly speedy delivery (even in Covid19 times). Prices could be better but I guess you pay a little more for convenience.",2
Nice easy refund and quick delivery To,2
"Great selection, fast shipping. BUT, Amazon did not get big by being nice or fair. My seller account was suspended for no given reason. It took a year and letters to Bezos to get it back.  By the way, when you post content, Amazon owns it forever. Then they locked my consumer buyer account - again for reasons unknown. Amazon insisted that my account was new (WRONG - had it for years) and finally suggested that I just open a new account (what, and lose years of purchase history?). This is the short version of things. I will NEVER use Amazon again.",0
I cannot understand the negative reviews because I have ordered lots of items with free delivery and collect from a pick up point . Always delivered before the date stated . Never had a problem ,2
"Got to say i love Amazon. No more going to town, paying for parking, speaking to useless staff in shop. Waiting weeks for delivery.£80 a year for next day delivery to my desk along with a TV subscription is great value.Never disappointed with Amazon, high street let me down time and again.",2
"Normally, I have no issues with my returns. I learned something new that may help for future purchase for consumers. If any item is on DISCOUNT for what ever reason that means the item is not RETURNABLE even if it states it is returnable. Shein does not make this clear. What is clear is if the item is underwear, make up, Jewlery, pet food or flash sales ect these are non returnable.",1
Crooks & thieves. I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.,0

"I have ordered two goodss in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.  Now I am wondering if I can trust them to get a package delivered for Christmas, even with “guaranteed “ order dates.",1
Service is fine. easy to order.,1
"Amazon alwqays has fast delivery times, and their customer service is excellent .",2
To start off could not understand any of the reps(Indian) second was passed around to 4 different people. Third somehow I spent close to 2k on Amazon because I use to get 5% back  and somehow they reset my account to 0%. If I would of known I would of bought my stuff from a local business and get back 3% on my CC. Either way will no longer use Amazon because of the horrible customer service and lack of knowledge to their own product. P.S maybe you should screen you employees to speak actually English.,0
Very happy with the recent DVD promotions.  The live chat feature helped me know what I could order and the delivered products exceeded my expecatations.  Thank you!,2
Amazon makes shopping so convenient and affordable. They have a huge selection and their prices are almost always the lowest anywhere. Free two-day shipping is an incredible deal and I highly recommend you join Amazon Prime.,2
"I'm sorry. Welcome to tech.....get your people set up at home... I just tried to call customer service and they had a recorded line saying pretty much ""we cant help you"" useless.",0
"I have been a loyal Prime Member for 4 years now, and was an avid customer for many years before that. I have enjoyed my time as a customer with Amazon, and will continue on for many years to come.",2
"Mostly decent - many counterfeit items are being found more recently though, which is a shame. Other than that, it's alright.",1
Amazon is awesome and has great customer service. The end.,2
"I never thought I will be writing a negative review for Amazon 0.o but here goes. Things have clearly changed with Amazon deliveries. I’ve got another (second already) order stuck on “there was a problem with delivery” status. You can’t reschedule, you can’t cancel, you’re advised to contact Amazon but I’ve spent 20 min looking around for a way to contact them and no luck. It’s truly ridiculous and Amazon just went from providing one of the best e-commerce experiences around to a shockingly bad one! I mean what the actual ... ! Can’t even get a bloody refund!",0
Bloody love amazon! Especially prime 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼,2
"Amazon customer service doesnt even deserve 1 star. My fiance and I ordered decorations for our wedding next month, and they delivered it to the wrong address. They offered to refund to a gift card to re order. Well we did and that didnt make it either. Now we are to the point thst we will never use amazon again, and they wont refund my money back to my original account, they want to instead send another gift card. My fiance has been on the phone for the past 2 days trying to resolve this and get our money back and they refuse to refund my money back to my bank. Poor service lost this customer and family for life.  F#&* you Amazon.",0
Amazon are excellent on prices and goods. Quick delivery and I was kept up to date with details of delivery by e-mail.,2
"I use Amazon a lot. Their customer assistance is great, but increasingly I’m finding it time-consuming and frustrating to sift through all the “sponsored” and cheaply made Chinese items. Even if I search for Made in USA, the Chinese stuff shows up first. ",1
"+can buy items you can't buy locally+if you have a prime membership prime video is ok'ish and sometimes acceptable.-prices usually 2x to 10x, and sometimes even 100x the going retail value-Defective goodss other people have returned are resold as new while still defective-Products that are only supposed to only be sold sealed and sterile are resold open and unsterile after people have returned them.-Amazon sometimes prevents critical reviews such as when I bought a Amazon's Choice dash cam and wished to make a mixed review (it was super inexpensive but also had flaws like the image being flipped so it looked like you were driving in England instead of america.) but when trying to review i get the message:""Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this goods. Due to this activity, we have limited this goods to verified purchase reviews.""despite it being a verified purchase of mine",1
"Hello, My 13 yo daughter purchased a ipad pencil  via amazon and she is very pleased with the product. She is a able to do real fun stuff with it as she is an artist apprentice!",2
Deliveries are amazingly extremely slow. I live 5 minutes from there location in my town and yet I have to wait all day long for a package and most of the time it’s delivered to the wrong address. So I decided to have package delivered at a hub station close to my house keep them from delivering it at the wrong house as always and still got to wait all day long WOW Unbelievable,0
"Amazon has gone downhill fast.  We have prime and pay a lot for it.  When we ordered we will have a delivery date, but you can’t go with that. All we can do is sit and wait to see if it shows up on time.   We are currently waiting on a item we purchased for my parents which was supposed to have been delivered on October 7th.  We checked to see the status to see if was delayed, it could be delivered either the 8th or 9th is October.  So we checked again today and it showed they tried to deliver it at 3:17 a m this morning (oct 8th).  Yes, it shows 3:17 am, they said they attempted to deliver and will have try again.  At this point I’m upset with amazon (this is not the only time this as happened).  I called today to get told “ sorry all we can at is they can’t find a driver to deliver it and it will be delivered as soon as they can). I lost it at his point and told them this is not acceptable.    I finally got to a supervisor who said she was sending a message to find out what was going on. She said we would hear something within 2 hours.  Well it’s been 5 hours and again nothing from amazon. No phone call, no message or package.    Buyer beware just because you have prime and pay a lot for it don’t mean you will receive your packages as they state when you purchase it.",0
"There’s a reason Bezos is loaded.So convenient. Amazon Prime Now is actually scary for my bank balance.Wish they’d provide a more intuitive and dependable refund assistance, though. Have been ripped off twice by independent stores.",1
"WHY YOU DON'T FIRED THIS GUYS WORKING FOR AMAZON !!!!????   I enjoyed buying things from Amazon, but now , no more. I'm even afraid to make more orders , because they still the packages after they take de picture and lately they delivered my orders to the other neighbors door. After that you have to spend time making phone calls  to complain about it. I'm tired and afraid to make more orders. THANK YOU ,",1
"Amazon is big for a reason. You can pretty much find anything you need here, and get a killer deal. With the Markeplace guarantee, you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter. Comforting when ordering from around the world. I rely on Amazon for household goods, electronics, camera equipment, shoes and clothing, books, and entertainment, everything but husband.",2
"The shipping times are so bad now, thinking of canceling prime. Ordered a video game that shipped last Saturday with 2 day shipping and it's still not here. Not lost, just moving extremely slow. It's been in my state since yesterday, in a city 30 minutes away and it's still moving slow.",0
"I like thousands of others started using an app advertised by Amazon Alexa called Anylist, this app was the best thing I have ever used to such an extent that I actually paid for the full version, something I never do. The Amazon in their wisdom decided that they were removing the Alexa link to Anylist this has totally ruined the Anylist experience, I like the others wish to complain to Amazon about their total disregard to their customers. I have now cancelled my Amazon account and my Amazon books in protest. O know this will make absolutley no difference but after paying for an app then the link being disgarded only 6 weeks later I am disgusted shame on you Amazon, oh and then they are promoting another app called Bring which compared to Anylist is rubbish",0
"Have ordered many things from Amazon and must say that they  are on the ball. Latest item was  from CurrentBody and what a superb product.   Great service all round.Thank you,",2
Amazon collects my prime membership monthly. This is the 7th month I have been unable to access my account. No amount of robots or letters or consumer complaints have penetrated the layers of their indifference. They simply refuse to help.,0
"Rubbish pathetic wrapping material.I bought a Paper Mache bird with hearts attached and Amazon decided to post it to me in a Cardboard Stiff Envelope?No wrapping around the object to cushion it, nothing.",1
Amazon knows what you like and have great services very impressed,2
"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!",1
Never had any problem with anything bought from Amazon.Dont even bother with the express delivery as most items delivered within a couple of days.,2
"They are about the worst thimf ever most corrupt idiotic people I’ve ever come in contact with. Jeff Bezos is a narcissist and let all the money he made go to his head. The site is inoperable for the most part and when it is operable and you can actually place an order don’t expect to get what you ordered or get it when you expected it. You will get the wronf items with no customer care to back it up . The customer care chat is only available in the app and it malfunctions. Though it malfunctions, the people who respond also have noAccess to actually assist with anything . They just want to call you and waste moreTime. Who would do this except a narcissist ? Who would have rules like this ? Also in spite of all the times their company is messed up in other accords, the weird thing was my account was blocked because of me using it. So I used to a few other times before and got poor service so I quit using it but someone wanted a gift card so I sent them one and the account was LOCKED because they thought it was fraud even tho it came fromMy IP address. So I do I like chat like I say they people there are of no use they just want me to call. This was for a friends birthday . Time is sensitive in this regard . Wake up",0
"I like it, that amazon has many goodss for low prices even i buy on other portals too!!!",1
well they make it difficult to get any advice on customer assistance. I bought an orbitrek and the remote does not work onj this machine but it puts my tv on mute.  I would like them to give me an answer to this.,1
I have been using Amazon for a while and really like their customer support. I wish they audit sellers on the platform properly because many ship from china and return policy is not clear on those. ,1
Its amazon it ticks the box and its grand,1
Thanks  for getting my order delivered succesfully,2
"I recently bought a school text book, art equipment and a reading book. I pay for amazon prime and as always my package arrived the very next day, which was very useful because I needed the art supplies and textbook for school the next day. it was delivered early in the day so I did not have to wait inside for the whole day. my items were all in the same cardboard package which is good because it is saving paper so good for then environment. overall I was very pleased with this delivery and I will be spreading the word of my positive experience.",2

"Absolutely useless customer service agents.  If you have a question don't expect a solution,  just expect to be given 3 different numbers leading to people who don't know anything",0
I would not even give them even one star. Since the virus thing they are only doing chats . These pples are not taking their job seriously more like a play ground full of kids not doing jobs correctly. They pass u from or person to next in space of 20 mins I chatted to 6 pples . None of then had a clue and could not be asked to read perious notes. Forever repeating uelf and they tire blind eye to their online delivery rime star stating what ties which I missed my delivery. I he been buying from these company fr time and once I get my orders I will be deltin my account and shopping else where like eBay or etc. Ths company don't have respect fr customers and too greedy fr money to the point they turn bind to their own B's. Iill b contacting watch dog and local omboman,0
"I have been an amazon customer for many years and a prime subscriber for nearly as long. Recently, i have notices a sharp decline in the service provided by Amazon, most notably, their inability to deliver items on time or even on the same day. I order a pair of headphones for next day delivery which were dispatched that day, then shipped in the early hours, the item was sent out for delivery and a slot for delivery was sent. This time came and went and a corporate apology e mail sent. Having waiting in all day, I had to go out and at 9pm, I received a call, stating a delivery was attempted but i was not in. Driver said he would deliver following day. Today, i have been informed that the item has been sent back to the local sorting office and a delay has been experienced in delivery and no one knows (or cares, as they have my money) why or when i will receive the item and this is on the Prime service.This is FAR FROM A PRIME SERVICE and is happening more often than not now. Not only to you pay your annual subscription, you also pay a PREMIUM PRICE for PREMIUM DELIVERY which doesn’t occur. I have attempted to speak with customer service who just read out and repeat the scant information from the tracking info. In reality, the delivery companies take on work beyond their abilities in their greedy pursuit of wealth and when things go wrong, they just brush the problem aside and carry on as if nothing has happened, they have no real strategy for dealing with balls ups. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and I shan’t be using Amazon anymore, there are better and more reliable options out there. This seems to be my only option now and i advise others to do the same and save their money! NOT RECOMMENDED!",0
"Worst customer care service.I bought woodland shoes from Amazon on 12th Nov 22 ( order no.402-0594892-5378726).and replaced it due to uncomfortable after wearing it.It is picked up from me but, did not given me the replacement shoe. I asked about this but courier person told me that I’ll get it from another courier representative.At evening second courier person came to give me my shoe but he denied to give it without replacement shoe, which I was already given to another Amazon courier person at afternoon.From 21st Nov., I had called 11 times to Amazon customer care about my issue and asked about my replacement product but, not got any answer from Amazon customer service.I have provided pick up tracking also but it is not working. They said they are investigating this but they do nothing.Be careful when buy from Amazon. No one respond if you will face any problem in the product.",0
I don't know how I would of coped without Amozon over this last year...with everything that has happened...it's times like this we have to appreciate them and all there delivery drivers for all they do...Thanks guys so much,2
items get returned to sender instead of delivered. not worth buying from,1
"Minus 5 🌟 to the guy who was pretending to be a delivery person Just had a parcel delivered from AMAZON. Had a text reminder saying it’s been delivered, yes it was but not in the safe place, I always get it delivered to which is in the porch at the bottom of the garden. Where was it delivered to? In the grass just inside the gate.I went up and caught the guy before he got in his van and I asked him why he didn’t knock on the door his ignorant answer was I didn’t want to disturb you. I asked if he thought that was funny he said whatever, I told the ignorant guy I’m reporting him he said whatever feel free. So is this the type of person AMAZON employ? No wonder they have a bad name. But do they care? Not while they are making billions in profits ",0
"All okay, how can it be 1.7 rating? I can’t understand",2
"So orribile my experience with Amazon registration seller. I register myself like individual sellers, not professional and still my account is on hold I can't sell nothing, Amazon stole my money from bank account 47.99$, and I found out that they registered my account like a professional seller, and next month I should pay again the same amount for don't be able even to sell nothing. I'm living in UK and the country where I can sell in North America. This is crazy, you try to call the customer service and the call don't go on. Live chat same problem, isn't available. I really regret my idea to sell in Amazon. SHAME!",0
"“BLUE LIVES MURDER” seriously?!? YOU KNOW THOSE BLUE LIVES ARE BLACK AS WELL?!? Their lives don’t matter because of a few bad people, which are found in every industry- just look in the mirror?! Are you going to tell us you can’t block this merchandise automatically? Why can we only report each other’s comments but not YOUR content?! YOU ARE SO TRANSPARENT AMAZON LIKE YOU ARENT PROMOTING THIS GARBAGE JUST TO PROTECT YOUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FROM GETTING TORCHED! Don’t call those blue lives when the protestors catch on to your scam! I’ll shop elsewhere FOREVER!

Hope it was worth the few dollars of blood money!",0
"I have been a customer of Amazon less then 2 years.  My concern is they do not deliver your packages to your unit door if you live in a condo.  They just throw them on the floor in your mailroom, if you have one.  They have no respect for the items they are delivering. They act like all they want to do is just get in and out of the building as quick as possible.  They can't compare with FedEx, UPS or even USPS delivery service.",0
I love Amazon you get great everyday deals on all  sorts of things I buy alot of different products from Amazon and had no bother always been a it's a pleasure to shop with them,2
"The return process is a rip-off! I bought something and it was much larger than expected.  I wanted to return it.  During the process, I had a couple of options, first print my own return label in which the charge was over 13 Dollars!  Expletive (I can't use bad language)! 13 Dollars to print your own return label!!! The second was just to drop it off for free at the UPS store.  I had used the latter method before and it took well over two months to get a partial refund.  I never got a full refund.  Calling the service center took such a long time on the phone with someone who barely spoke English. On my current return, they said it would take over a month to ""process"" the return!  Expelitive! In years past, I would get a refund once the item was scanned in at the UPS center.  Why are they holding my money for so long?!  I have been an Amazon shopper for years.  I think that in the future I  will be looking to other online retailers.",0
Amazon is pretty decent.It's useful for cheeper price and decent quality items.,1

"I like shopping through Amazon but this last interaction might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the shipment really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for shipment people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, shipment person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1
"I have almost alvays positive expierience.Contrary to Royal Mail they can handle to actualy deliver parcels, can you please give RM a training?Very good custmer service, I wish more companies deliver similar expierience.",2
I have done many wonderful transactions on Amazon with never even a tiny glitch. Good shipping and fast service.,2
"So far a good experience as a customer. No delay in delivery, no problem with the customer service.",2
Overall amazon have been pretty decent but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as average as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,1
"I give Amazon a 3 out of 5 rating due to their affordable item range, which is a definite plus. However, they need to address the issues of incorrect deliveries and improve their reshipping process to provide a smoother customer usage.",1
"I should have read the reviews here before issuing an order. They are the worst ever. I issued an order, and they charged me but did not send all the books. Then, after more than two hours of customer service chat somebody found the error yet did not solve it. I contacted again and more than an hour of chat afterward did not provide any result. I believe is an organised scam where they aim for you to give up and steal your money.",0
"Fast delivery, amazing service, wanted to return a hand trolley, processed by amazon within 3 days. Easy returns. Will buy again from them.",2
"I use Amazon a lot. And for the most part it's fine. However just recently it's been a bit of a joke. A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the goods itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items. Then I also pay for Amazon Prime, the idea being next day shipment. Ordered an item and didn't receive it next day. Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the shipment date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days. So I pay a premium for you to make me wait longer than expected and then not send the item and make me wait for a refund. No explanation either. It's really annoying. Makes me think twice about using them again and makes me wonder about Prime membership.",1
Terrible customer service run by human robots. You can't really discuss any issue.They treat their customers with outmost disrespect.I predit that amazon will not be what it is now in a few years.,0
"Have been a Amazon Prime member for 2 years. It started GREAT would have given a 5 star, however, in the last 6 months it's going down hill fast. I'm suppose to get Free 2 day shipping. No, it's maybe 3 day at best mostly because they use USPS which could care less when you get your mail & in what condition. What ever happened to the promise of DRONES! AND since packages come through USPS they look as if they've been run over by the order trucks/carts. THEN, you have to deal with Amazon Customer Service to get goodss replaced or returned & that is a chore. It's like dealing with foreign high school students. I still love Amazon Products but don't know if they are worth the shipping hassle. Questioning Prime Membership. (Netflix for Movies  is better)",1
"I recently received a package of 4 items in one Amazon box. One of the items was just a box with no product inside. The Amazon representative stated that since the weight of the box was correct when shipped, the problem is with the shipper or receiver.  I explained that when I picked up the Amazon package the box was intact and the Amazon seal unbroken.I find it frustrating that Amazon cannot accept that their scaling system may have made an error. The only other possibility is that I am lying in an attempt to receive free product, which is extremely insulting. I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years.Paul",0
"ok support, pretty fine prices for most of the things you can find.Sometimes order is super fast and sometimes it is delayed, you never know what's coming.But in most cases, the top wait is a week.",1
Great website with good offers especially during prime days. More reliable and trustworthy than the likes of eBay.,2
amazon is a decent platform for B2b bussines.,1
"I've been a prime member like forever. This past year, numerous orders have taken a week or longer, when said to be delivered within 2-3 days. Some I was able to cancel, others could not be cancelled. Also, more and more packages are damaged or torn open. I even received one order (vitamins) where the envelope was EMPTY and looked like it was never sealed. It's been pretty aggravating...",1
"Awful ""customer service"" program. Everything is this self-service garbage. When you need more detail or an explanation that you cannot get with self-service answers, you are left in the dark. To actually speak to a real person, it is so hidden to get to it's beyond frustrating. Finally getting to an area that had a chance to message with a representative, there was ""technical difficulties"" and could not communicate. No simple email or anything. They should not even have a so-called ""customer service"" section, since it isn't. Terrible.",0

Horrible delivery service they were good for awhile now its gotten worse even when it says out for delivery they don't even show up wasteing my whole day I think Jeff Bezos would be unhappy if he found out how these lazy people have turned his business into the worst ever,0
"Awful company. Refuse to refund payments for wrong deliveries, missing deliveries stated as being 'stolen' by customer service but nothing done about it, customer service always saying I'd be contacted within 24 hours by email or phone, but that never happens. The place is full of a bunch of liars who don't understand how to do their jobs and don't give a damn about their customers.No way am I spending a penny with these crooks ever again.",0
It has become my go to place for all my shopping. I really am un-happy about the new tracking/targeting system. I feel that they are now charging me more for idem's that I may want. So I am now more careful about what I buy there and shop around more. I use to be a faithful Amazon shopper. Just a ordinary management decision. Amazon has lost 40% of my business because of this. But they have lots of money... :),1

"Sadly, Amazon Prime is no longer Prime! My last 4 orders have not been delivered on time. It seems the Phonex facility doesn't care about On Time Deliveries. Plus they have a ordinary habit of losing packages. I know that Phonex is only 1.5 hours from Tucson and I know they make several stops along the way, but, if it takes a driver over 12 hours to make his trip, you need new drivers!",1
"Amazon is #1 in my book. I highly recommend using Amazon for your online shopping needs. I order through them on a continuous basis from as small as a pencil sharpener, clothes, home theatre system, up to car parts and all. I have not once since shopping and ordering through this site ever had any problems or had any issues with any of my orders. They have EVERYTHING and the prices are way cheaper then in the stores and best of all it's shipped right to you. Amazon is my favorite place to shop and I don't have to go to a ton of different stores it's all in one spot at my fingertips then delivered to my door within 3-5 days max. I love Amazon and I guarantee you will too. Best site ever!!",2

"There's been a lot of wrong items sent to me lately. I've shopped at Amazon for years and recently there's more errors with the orders. I notice this is more common with high priced items being 'mistaken' for much cheaper ones. My last order was supposedly delivered to me, which was supposed to be a $60 drink mix pack, and instead I had received someone's clearly worn and returned sports bra. What's so hard about installing a camera system to have full view of all employees as they work?! I had to spend 2 hours of my Sunday trying to print a return label and drive around to the nearest actual UPS drop off location for their mistake. Now I have to wait even longer and hope they can get it right this time. Makes me feel as though I now have to video-record picking up my package at the locker in its entirety, which is ridiculous. I was reading somewhere that Amazon is instilling a lot of fear in employees and publicly shaming those who are caught stealing but I feel that simply installing more cameras and looking into discrepancies as they happen would prove more effective in getting rid of dishonest workers.",0
All Christmas shopping purchased online. Absolutely everything arrived when they said it would and in great condition. I allowed a bit of extra time for delays as I assumed it would be a bit hit and miss at this busy time of year but it wasn't needed! Great communication about it all too. Very happy shopper :),2
"Literally the biggest shambles of lies and rubbish, waited a full month for a refund, now fighting over a refund for postage even though the item sent was wrong, been promised a refund twice this week and now being told I have to contact the seller who’s ignored me for a full month. Advisors lie and fob you off, none of them have a clue. I’m sure Amazon won’t miss my business and likewise I won’t miss their incompetence, lies and total grief that this shower manage to give out. Good riddence!",0
"Every time I use these guys they delight, whether it's on my kindle or ordering a new BBQ.",2
"I use my EBT card to purchase seeds and other EBT eligible items as listed as such on their website. I have tried to order some tomato seeds and micro greens that are listed on their website as EBT eligible and they aren't working. I called customer service to try and get help, was transferred several times, the first 4 people were very nice and tried to be helpful but the last person I was transferred to was not helpful at all, told me the items are not EBT eligible when it shows up eligible on my end. I asked to speak with whoever was in charge and she first told me they were just going to tell me the same thing she was and then I persisted to speak to whoever was in charge on this shift and she was very hateful, told me they aren't taking phone calls. I said that's fine transfer me to their voicemail and I'll leave them a message. She then hangs up on me. Freaking joke. I don't have time to keep calling back only to get hung up on as I have small children.",0
"Amazon Prime is worth the money. Fast delivery, they even deliver on Sunday with standard Prime delivery.",2
Always uses USPS even after reporting that we were having issues with them. Packages always lost cos they leave them a block away from our house.,1
I received an item which was a pack of 4 smart plugs. Only three worked. I logged into Amazon and contacted customer service through web chat. The refunded me my money and told me to keep the three that works. Excellent customer service!,2
"I love Amazon, they are by far the best online retailer. over the years I have not had even one problem and if i did, it was always resolved satisfactory. Thank you Amazon",2
Amazon has robbed me of products and are now trying to steal my money claiming they didnt receive items back when I clearly did and offer proof. Their customer service reps are terrible mostly from overseas. Phillipines and India,0
Ordered 4 prime items. Needed today. 2 delivered but in my safe space although I was home!!! 2 apparently unsuccessful delivery as I wasn’t in. Oh yes I was. Idiot forgot them and most probably couldn’t be bothered to come back. I’m fuming as they were birthday presents. Disgusted with Amazon. Really gone downhill!!!,0
"I’m writing this review to tell the truth about amazon.com. I have been a member for several years and even though I have bought many items of good quality, some of the items sold were in poor state. I am warning customers to do your homework and research the individual sellers. Some of them are not honest and some either were damaged, defective or otherwise false goods. Furthermore, Amazon disallows bad reviews regarding late or in accurate deliveries that failed to arrive on time. This is a concern to me because it appears Amazon is only interested in profits and not customer satisfaction. They need to do better with the respective delivery companies charged with making sure things are delivered on time and to the correct address. It’s inconceivable and inexcusable for Amazon not to properly vet their sellers and deliver to the correct address on time.",0
"I cannot get enough: subscribe and save, next day service, and lots of add ons.",2
Amazon is amazing! I find great deals on there. Subscribe and save is such a great tool. Amazon Prime is one of the most valuable things I've spent money on.,2
Amazon are a great site and can always find what I need and generally are cheaper than their nearest rival,2
Pretty reliable but prefer boutique shopping.,1
Absolutely  disgusting! Ordered twice and order gets cancelled and no show of it on track and manage orders to ask for a refund! NO ITS NOT STRANGE ITS INTENTIONALLY DONE! You need to go back and study business and customer service!I EXPECT A REFUND TO BE AUTOMATICALLY  CREDITED! I have the email confirmation.Sack these people!NOT BUYING FROM THEM!-6!,0
"Many things. The album I ordered was supposed to be new. Instead it was used with scratch marks and the cover was bent and coffee stained. It took many months of back and forth before I was refunded. Then to top it off, I order another album and all of sudden they were billing me for Amazon Prime which my wife's pays for on her account. I tried to get reimbursed for this charge and it was once again a miserable experience. I cancelled the prime membership and Amazon account and the Amazon MasterCard through MBNA. Worst experience ever.",0
This is my 'go to' website- first stop Amazon!,2
I think amazon are an awful company but due to online shopping being a must for some items you are left with little choice but to use them occasionally.The only acceptable thing with amazon is it is easy to get a refund.,1
ordered twirling barons and they were delivered on time and wasnt a big delivery fee,2
"When you think, oh it's FROM AMAZON, I'LL BE SAFE BUYING FROM THEM,, NERRRRP! Think again. I cannot tell you how many people I know of, myself included, have gotten ripped off from this major company!! Especially with beauty products, name brand products, even CLOTHING!! I mean, Amazon's ""3rd party merchants"" are just a friggen way for Amazon to get around getting sued for selling faulty crap! It's a cop out so they don't have to claim responsibility when their customers get ripped off!! It's so they can say, ""oh it wasn't us, how would we have known that vendor was sending you a fake product that burned your skin,,!!"" They KNOW alot of their ""3rd party jerk so-called sellers"" are ripping their millions of customers off BUT THEY DON'T GIVE A CRAP AND AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE IT UNLESS THEY STOP MAKING MONEY FROM US,  THE CONSUMER!! THEY NEED TO START SELLING THEIR OWN **AUTHENTIC** INVENTORY THAT THEY CAN PERFORM QUALITY CONTROL ON!!! I just can't believe how many people have gotten ripped off, yet mad amounts of hard working Americans are still throwing their money away to them! I mean shoot, if you wanna go to wish and compare some of their products to Amazon's, you might be surprised to see IT'S ALOT OF THE SAME CRAP!! Unbelievable they're still a top merchant. Makes me CRAZY!!",0
"Your shipment staff are rubbish, they just throw packages into porch and walk off leaving porch door open.This is a repeat complaint and you do nothing about training. They are all THICK AND USELESS",1
Virtos UK (Digital Red Square) awful fraudulent company with Amazon not much better.sold me a refurbished Samsung Note 20 ultra with a defective screen with a 1yr refurbished warranty offered by Amazon.sent phone back for a full refund and only part refunded.contacted Amazon customer services 4 times but as we know another money launderering company takes your money and offers nothing in return for customer support.my advice...stay well clear of Amazon and Virtos UK (Digital Red Square).,0
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1
I use amazon like most however don't display same day shipment if order by such a time if when ordered in that time you have no intention too than add 2 or 3 days for shipment.  Boxes still take the Michael waste of space half the time small items in huge boxes.,1
Review text not found,1
So I changed my phone number and also got a new phone and couldn’t get into my Amazon. I had things in my cart but nothing I needed went thru all the security questions with no problem and was still told Thst my account is locked because the agent tried to many times and it locked so I needed to call back in 4 hours and go thru being on hold and answering all the questions again. Due to that I cancelled my prime account and that’s that. The customer service was terrible from the two agents I got before the supervisor who was actually nice.,0
"I have been a customer for many years and only returned 3 products. First exchange was handled great. Second was wrong color twice but still taking care of. Third not so much, amazon made be go through seller which I contacted twice with no respond. Talked to amazon again told me it's to late for refund. All I wanted was the missing parts to my order. Will never shop again with Amazon spend thousands of $$$ with them and they don't care if the sellers fill their orders or not.",0
You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,1
"Amazon engages in wholesale fraud and the FTC and courts need to act.  Amazon profits from fraudulent sales when customers fail to jump through the hoops to obtain a refund and Amazon is a party to this rampant fraud by falsely asserting to customers that items never sent have instead been ""Shipped"" and that they are ""On their way, but running late"".  Amazon told me that and when I clicked ""Track Package"", Amazon suggested that I call the USPS and provided its phone number -- with no tracking information whatsoever!  Ever wonder why it's impossible to get through to the USPS on the phone?",0
"I'm happy dealing with Amazon as a customer, but not as someone who's applied to work for amazon. Watching videos on YouTube I heard nothing but bad things working with Amazon. Despite those negative reviews I just looked at it as a opportunity. Anyway make long story short my drug test was screwed up I made arrangements to take another one, gave up six hours of my day, and since I just been getting the run around. Well todays the deadline. I don't even work for them and I'm having problems, I can only imagine the problems I would have if I do work for them. But I'm done with trying to get a job with them, things work out for the better and this is a sign that this probably isn't the job for me. Anyway it's time to let go and move on.",0
Amazon make it VERY difficult to get free shipment when you spend over £20. It used to be automatically applied. Now you have to get past the constant flogging of Amazon prime go through the shipment option and select free shipment. Not only must you spend a whopping 20 quid you have to avoid getting mugged at the check out for free shipment. How many BILLIONS do this lot need.,1
"GPU scalpers have made it impossible to use their service, cancelling Amazon Prime and moving on. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ALLOW BUSINESSES TO SCREW PEOPLE ONE YOUR WEBSITE.",0
"As with most Amazon customers I use them a lot because they carry such a wide variety of items and frequently I can find items on Amazon that could take me hours or days of shopping in stores.  But there are these aggravating issues: (1) Their auto packing tosses items into one huge box, frequently with insufficient packing materials, and I have had so many broken items I no longer order items such as prime pantry (2) Because they do put as much as possible in one box it is frequently too heavy for me to handle and is frequently put in front of my door so I cannot open the door and have to walk around the house to move it to the other side, which any sensible shipment person would realize (3) Amazon's newer shipment assistance that I guess is avoid using the post office involves a number of different carriers, some of which are so poor that I have to call customer assistance...once because an item was just tossed into a snow bank on my driveway, another when it was tossed onto a dark driveway where it was smashed, or I suddenly got a notice that no one was there to accept the package and I NEVER changed from unattended package instructions (4) sometimes the shipment person leaves the package at my back door, where it does not occur to me to search for packages, so sometimes it is there for a few days before I realize it was delivered (5)when you are expected to say why you are returning an item you get a list of options that for me have seldom included any item connected with why I am returning it so I just mark off any one of them and hope for the best (5) if you ever get an email address or phone no. for Amazon customer assistance cling onto it because if you try to get that by an inquiry on the Amazon search you will never find it there.  All of these negatives have led to my checking with EBay now and ordering there when they have the same items, which increasingly they do.",1
Generally I love Amazon and order from them frequently.  I ordered a couch on Dec 20 and delivery keeps getting pushed back.  They shipped it USPS!!!! WHY would a piece of furniture be shipped this way?  I am livid.  10 days later and still no answer.,0
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"Amazon will make right by their customers. Of course everyone makes mistakes from time to time. But they stand by their return policy, bulky items often not even need to be returned to get refund in case there is a problem. Often, items will arrive earlier than promised, and you can even order to a nearby store or pickup location if you are more comfortable doing that.Amazon is famous for its costumer friendly policies and putting the costumer first.",2
"As an Amazon Prime user who frequents both the Instant Video function and the main wesbite I can say - to a tee, this is one of the best services i've ever dealt with.Customer Support - 10/10      Customer Support Staff seem to always go out of their way to try and help you with an issue, and the majority of the time will compensate you for your troubles. I was given 1 month free of Prime for my RX480 GFX Card being 2 days later than it was supposed too.I was given 2 months free of Prime and a full refund for a product being over a week late.Instant Video - 10/10     No issues with load times and/or buffering. Streaming Service works well which is better than some others.ConsAmazon sellers and Amazon themselves have to pay people to deliver your product, these people tend to be the only issue in a well oiled machine and are an issue with any online retailer.",2
Amazon employ thiefs to deliver their items! I have no choice but to stop using their services now as most of the parcels these days never arrive! They dont care if you are in or not and have come home several times to find my purchases left in front of the unsecured see through glass doors that allow literally anyone into our block of flats! Dispicable! Reported several times to them but nothing ever changes.,0
"I've used Amazon as a consumer for years, always found them to have a good range of products and reasonable pricing.  I've also found they will stand behind their products if there's an issue - for example, I just recently completed getting a refund on an order that had been pending delivery for so long the online system no longer had a way to cancel it.  However, chat support took care of it in less than 5 minutes.  I'm happy, and will continue to be a regular customer.",2
"I ordered an electric gate kit through Amazon at £ 299 including a £ 30 discount which got lost in their delivery process so I was told to re order which I did.  It didn't include the £ 30 discount this time so I contacted Amazon via Live Chat who confirmed in writing ( a copy I have ) they would honour the £ 30 discount and to contact them once the gates arrived for them to initiate the refund.  I did this and was told on 5 different occasions they now wouldn't honour their promise and there was nothing they could do.  It is now available again with the £ 30 discount which I'm not eligible for as I now have the goods !!  Absolutely shocking service !!!  To add to this, the gates that were delivered had to be signed for.  I was out, they left them at my back door which is visible from the street !!  Their records said it had been signed for by me.  I had left instructions for it to be left in my garage !!!  ",0
amazon is great but what get me mad is that IF YOU AIN'T IN THERE PROGRAM . you can't write no reviews or they band you from writing reviews. I am honest person and I show video/pictures of the goodss and still got band.,1
hmmm....................................................amazon had the stuff the my family had needed. but it seems its just a whole scam. took her money and her happiness away in just a few hours. BAD REVIEW!!! #AMAZONTHESCAMMERS #NOMONEYGIVERS #NOREFUNDS. just great we have no more money for quismois.,0
"I have brought lots of things from Amazon and I do love the company, however I ordered something so exciting in about March time and it never ever turned up, I got an email saying they had received the order but it never turned up, need my money back 😩",1
Love the support. Shipping can be improved.,1
"Amazon is truly amazing. I am a long time customer and recently I ordered a down alternative comforter and it was delivered, However I made a mistake or someone in the house did and I could not locate the package.  I called Amazon and I told them that I did not receive my package. They issued a refund . I subsequently found my package and I called Amazon back and asked them to cancel the refund . They told me they had no way of canceling the refund, and I did not have to return the item, and I could keep my comforter as a happy holiday gift from Amazon. Now, that's what I call EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! TY AMAZON!",2
Customer Service total waste of time. Chat line asked for someone to call (a number which rings you then plays music - 10 times!) & spent 30 minutes on hold on & off with the agent (whom I could hardly understand) with a nonsense response. Expected much better customer service from Amazon so clearly they have a lot of improvements to do.,0
"Fantastic service. I regularly purchase from Amazon. Delivery, customer service and returns are so convenient. Recently called to get some help with returns. As always the customer support lady was very helpful. keep it up.",2
"Amazon no longer allows bad review of rogue sellers even though they deliberately try to scam buyers! The details are a bit mundane but here they are for completeness:The photo and description of an item listed on Amazon was the legal ""UK"" labelled sticker for a UK car numberplate. Instead, this retailer deliberately shipped the no-longer-legal ""GB"" labelled sticker. Presumably the seller had a lot of old useless illegal ""GB"" labelled sticker stock to be disposed of! The seller is counting on the majority of buyers not bothering to return the stickers they did not order because of their relatively low value. When a review describing the above was left on Amazon, Amazon refused to post it, stating that their policies did not allow criticism of sellers even if they are scammers as in this case. Clearly Amazon is not prepared to let honesty and protection of their buyers from rogue sellers get in the way of their obscene levels of profits. Shame on you Amazon!",0
Ordered the VCR /DVD combo for a great price. Was told shipping would be three days and it end up being five. Overall decent usage.,1
Amazon is very easy to use and great discounts daily. Super fast delivery also.,2
"Eventually I got my order however they delivered to the wrong address, I had to go knocking on doors looking for my order which I needed on a urgent basis and this was not the first time thi has happened, such a well funded company, they must get things right, why does this have to happen, this cased me great stress and fraustration...",1
Great Service.I usually used this to order online. They deliver on time and without any issue,2
Sometimes you really have to check price comparisons etc but after Ebay Amazon is the next best thing I’ve found....,1
I really disappointed with Amazon customer service regarding my refund . They credit my refund back to Amazon gift card not refund back to my original account without my consent.   Amazon company is the largest online company but the service is horrible and not even compare to Walmart customer service.  Walmart customer service is outstanding they solved all the customers concerns .  Whoever in charge the Amazon customer service department please train your employees don’t waste your customers time if you can’t solve any issues…Horrible service that I have to  experience! Especially customer service is oversea.  Your customer service is the worst.  “. Let me ask my manager and at the end you waste my time for an hour doing nothing.”,0
Very bad service I ordered a mobile 21 may and the delivery time show me 23 may at 8:00 clock night time so I will wait all day but didn't receive anything and when I see on Amazon order status it's show me my package is damaged and return back so you can wait until the next update so I wait 2 days and then the status updates your package not delivered so we send you back you refund but still today I didn't receive refund I call customer service and they said please wait.next time I will never buy anything from Amazon...very bad bad bad and worse service.,0

"I have been an Amazon Prime member for many years. They were great, fast, efficient, and good customer service. However, several months ago I placed an order for an item that was on backorder for three weeks. No big deal. But when the three weeks past, I got an email saying the item would not be available for unknown amount of time. Just for kicks, I looked my item up on Amazon. It should to be in-stock but the process had tripled. Yes, tripled. I contacted customer service and asked how an item could be in-stock and yet my back-ordered order had not been filled. They could not give me an explanation and told me that if I ordered the same item at the new price, when it arrived, they would refund me the difference. When the new order arrived, I contacted them again for my refund and they refused to give it to me. After days of going back and forth with customer service, I finally wrote a letter to the corporate office with print-outs of all the chat messages with customer service. I sent the letter certified with signature delivery confirmation. I got the signature card back a week later and expected.Well, I just got the letter back... opened and taped back shut saying ""Return to sender - wrong address."" So I'm done with Amazon.",0

"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",0
Amazon has been good to me so far. I have heard a few things here and there from other people but those were mostly with people dealing with actually selling on Amazon. So far so good. If their stock goes up more I will reward them with 5 stars. LoL ;) Come on Amazon.com! YOU GOT THIS,2
"I don't know what the role of customer service reps is since they don't seem to have the ability to help beyond the standard buttons you can access yourself.I placed an order with 2-day shipping, but due to the quantity I ordered, I ultimately got an email stating the delivery date was now going to be over 3 weeks out. This was not acceptable for my timeline so I requested to cancel within an hour. I was told it was too far along in the shipping process to cancel. I questioned how that could be when it wasn't shipping for 3 weeks. No one could give me an answer to that. Every time they would respond with the same generic response that when items are shipping very soon, they can't be cancelled. I don't know how 3 weeks is soon. One rep had kids crying in the background and just said ""ummm"" for 10 minutes without providing any meaningful information at all. The ""supervisor"" had dogs barking in the background and gave the exact same generic response that didn't actually apply to my situation or order. Never got any resolution as no one was empowered to do anything more than try the same cancel button I have access to on my account.Really a baffling experience that this is the type of service Amazon provides.",0
"Never had any issue with Amazon. I have bought many items and returned many too and got full refund. Customer service agents have never failed me, very attentive and helpful, they are the backbone of Amazon; this review is for you.",2
I love amazon and their employees was pretty fine as well,1
"I've been a Prime member for many years. It's not perfect but I find Customer assistance is quick to resolve missed deadlines and defective acceptables. My only complaint is a lot of sellers are selling expired acceptables. So my advice is to check the dates on everything and contact customer assistance if you've received old items. It's true some reps are difficult to deal with but just keep escalating until you get results.Prime Video is another issue altogether. I refuse to pay extra fees for ""no commercials""This is a ridiculous money grab since a lot of content you can get for free on other non subscription channels.The above reasons are why I'm giving Amazon a 3 star rating. IMO they can do better!",1
Always deliver on time,2
Option for shipment i use Amazon on a regular basis I like them except they don't give you an option on who you want to to ship your items it's simple you pick your shipping company at check out 3rd time I've recommend this thanks,1

"I am writing this review literally minutes after having a WONDERFUL interaction with Amazon's customer service. I wish I had her name but I would like to thank the sweet customer service lady for assisting me with a billing issue on my account. She waa extremely polite, patient, & understanding. She was also very prompt with solving the issue and notified me my billing issue would reflect on my account within 3-5 business days which is understandable. I have used their services for years and have always had positive interactions with their team.",2
"I would give Amazon less than one star if possible. This week I had four emails from Amazon.au ... telling me that I had requested a change to my password .... and changed my email address to ... of all things .... my actual email address .... and that I had ordered an item of some sort .... and that it was about to be delivered .... and that it had been delivered to someone in Kent, England. So I tried to find a link that would allow me to submit information to have the situation corrected. None available. So I sent the info to the 'phishing' link. They acknowledged the contact. And that was the end of it. Every day I check to see if my bank account has been billed for this item. I have removed my credit card details from the Amazon site. I will not be doing business with them again. They do not deserve any loyalty. Because they are so remote from their customers ....................",0

"I've usually had good service with Amazon, but I just recently found out that they pick and choose what product reviews to post....and that is bad business! I recently did a review for paint that I had tried to buy twice from the same seller and both times it came open and leaking and the second time it leaked all over my floor and my table! I was very dissatisfied with the purchase and the packaging and said nothing else but that in my review and Amazon wouldn't post it stating I had somehow violated the review Guide lines....??? I guess stating that you're disappointed because you tried ordering it twice and both times it came leaking was unacceptable for some unknown reason.I have been an Amazon prime member for over 15 years and have never been so disappointed",0
Amazon  customer care number 8247721430 item related quairy . I have only used amazon prime vendors and have had absolutely no issues. Amazon has always shipped on time and had an easy no hassles return policy if a item was defective. I can’t say the same for other vendors such as Best Buy or Walmart.,1
Warning Amazon wont refund/replace your 8 months worth of saving money for an item that says Delivered but never Arrive support is no help at all. If you have 1 or 2 items that have been refunded/replace from the Manufacturer itself for no Delivery or  Manufactured defect you are put in the  Investigation Category and they will make up any excuse to not refund/replace your 8 months of saving up for a item....very disappointed in them when i do Purchase computer Products from them....,0
"I love Amazon and how it brings us things we want the next day, but they really need to train their support people better. It's always so frustrating to either be asked for information you have already given them or them clearly not understanding what you are asking, if a question is somewhat unusual. Reading from the script with 0 critical thinking is just not fine enough.",1
Very well written the format was great the footnotes were helpful acceptable reading material I felt the sadness and joy,1

"Ridiculous. I‘m seriously thinking of cancelling my Prime Membership. Not one package arrives next day anymore. Many don’t arrive on promised day. I ordered a casserole, it said „3 left order soon“. Total lie. I ordered, package never arrived when guaranteed. It turns out they didn’t even have the item in stock! That’s why it never shipped. And now I‘m told as soon as it‘s back in stock it will ship. This is 3 days after delivery guarantee date. It was never in stock to begin with. Very disappointed. Not going to be part of this Amazon circus anymore.",0
I cancelled my prime membership and now they have me signed up to mgm with no way of cancelling it. You can’t speak to anyone! They’re also taking money for Lionsgate and I can’t cancel. This is the last straw. In my view they’re treating customers appallingly.I no longer trust this company. There’s something quite sinister in that they won’t engage.I will never use them again on principle.,0
"Paid for prime, and arrived late, goods was acceptable. ",1
I pay for prime. However I am sick of these Chinese sellers seaping through they say they are UK based but that isn't true! Have to wait ages for items to arrive from China which isnt stated on the onset. This is dishonest to some degree. After orders the time frame often changes to longer. This is not the reliable Amazon I started out with.,1

Icalled your company and there is no one to speak with also am a very good customer.",0
Happy with service. They handled an incorrect order very well. Good stuff!,2
Great service good quality items use them all the time for mostly everything i buy.,2
"cant fault them. good prices, next day delivery, saves money",2
"Excellent customer service, If ever I have an issue they resolve it ASAP. I am a prime customer and always happy with the deals and deliveries I get. Would highly recommend.",2
"For the 2nd time in less than 2 months, I've had packages stolen because drivers refuse to follow directions to leave in lockbox. This time they lied about delivering to an unoccupied closed office,  where a non existent person supposedly signed for it. Amazon replaces, but it was something I needed TODAY.",0
The order hours aren't guaranteed anymore you order early for 6 - 10pm order check back Amazon has changed day & time to when you aren't home. Ordered also for Sat 1pm order all 5 items lost in transit. I have to wait 5 - 7 days for money back when Amazon never dispatched items.,1
"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Amazon Prime has gone completely ""Woke"". What a shame that my family and I try to watch a good wholesome movie on Amazon Prime and we have to be exposed to ads displaying drag queens. Our triune God says ""vengeance is mine"". Hell is a real place. Repent",0
"Amazon.com is an overpriced store that claims to offer ""free shipping"" for Prime Members, yet they encourage sellers to include the shipping price in the cost of the item. Everything is much more expensive than your local grocery store. Additionally, if you complain, they go back and delete all of your consumer reviews to try and ""punish"" you. Closing my Amazon account today!",0
normally on time and always cheap,2

"Had a baby registry with Amazon, and had an item we didn't receive (even though it showed delivered in the system, not sure if it was stolen or what). Reached out to customer service, and they said they would resend the item. Never got it, nor any communication. Then reached out again over a week later and was told they had refunded the gifter and there was nothing they could do about it to make it right for me/doing anything for me. Thanks for not solving a simple customer problem over some diapers Amazon....really means a lot after being a dedicated Prime member for decades.",0
"Lately the chat is in India. No matter what your concern, they cut and paste nonsense as a reply. They always insist they will take care of the problem and don't. Just get rid of the chat, Amazon, instead of having this charade.",0
"Truly non-existent customer service, they just send you around in circles. Bought a product from them, it’s defective so go to return it but, even though I have the physical receipt, it doesn’t show up in my order history!!?? They essentially make that my fault and give me various suggestions re. altering my settings which still don’t reveal my order history so I can’t return my defective product…let’s face it, they don’t care really anyway…awful people.",0
"Amazon lost my package. They sent me an email telling me they shipped my package to the wrong place and said we are canceling your order and refunding your money in 3 to 5 days. Why not just fulfill the order and re ship? I called to get more info and they said they can’t because of policy, and I have to reorder. Problem is they won’t refund my money for 3-5 days. I asked them if they could ship it faster, than the free 3-7 day free shipping that was offered, since they lost it and they said no. I understand that the package is coming from a 3rd party vendor, but if they can offer 2day prime shipping for free, than why not 2 day free shipping since they lost it? Customer support was very dismissive of my complaint and not at all helpful in getting my package in a timely manner.I also was unable to find a place to add a customer review regarding Amazon. I don’t want to leave a ordinary review for the 3rd party vendor, when it is an Amazon issue.I am sure I will continue to purchase from Amazon, but this shopping interaction did not make me feel very valued.",1

"They continue to change the shipping date of my packages both before and after the purchase when I by clothing. It is irritating because it leaves me with nothing to wear when they do that. I have to repeat dirty clothing because they keep over promising. I keep thinking they'll improve, but they don't.",0
"I would give it 0 stars if possible. I paid for prime. Not 1 package came after i upgraded. ""Running late"" Shipment lost"". Then you just take it. Its like being bullied in school for your lunch money. So many other options to purchase online.  I would recommend anything else than these scam artists",0
"I returned an item that was sold as new although it was used and amazon told me to return it and buy a new one. The only other such item was a lot more expensive, so they wrote me an email promising to cover price difference and import duties.Once I received the new item and contacted them for refund, they went back on what i have in writing and now refuse to uphold their end of the bargain. Desplicable behavior from a company that used to pride itself of their customer service.I spent almost an hour on the phone and nothing. Will not buy again.",0
Amazon only allows reviews that make them look good. If a vendor is absolutely terrible send you complete junk and then screws you over don't bother mentioning it because you will be blocked. Amazon will never let you give a negative review even if it allows you to give one star reviews you have to be a lawyer to make sure that you don't overstep their lines which are many many pages long by the way. It's impossible to leave a bad review without somehow running a foul of their ridiculous list of rules which include things like not complaining about the horrible customer service you get from a particular vendor or the horrible quality of something you get from a vendor none of those things are allowed. You can only say nice things regardless of the number of stars you give. They are a bunch of scum and after spending tens of thousands of dollars on their website they have blocked me for warning people against  Biologically dangerous crap that some of these people sell on these websites disguised as supplements. Amazon would much rather see you die from a bad supplement than let you see a bad review. Since all of their products originated in China I would recommend shopping absolutely anywhere else. Never forget all those babies cheap Chinese capitalists killed by putting melamine in baby formula. They do the same thing with everything else they send us and I have gotten so much crap from Amazon I have to say it is totally not worth spending any money on that website because it is all cheap junk. At least if you go to Walmart you can look at the Chinese junk before you buy it. ,0
I believe they are doing so well when it comes to confidentiality. And In most cases I always get exactly what I ordered. Amazon 👏,2

However, many of my ordered have been canceled with the same reason which says “cannot delivered/have problem with order”. All the canceled orders sold by amazon and a US based company.

"I used to love Amazon and it used it almost daily to purchase items. I am a prime member but I find most prime items are more expensive. I dislike the ""add on"" only set up of items. I don't like the fact I have to pay separate subscriptions for each Alexa/echo  I have in my home. My deliveries always turn up on time and on the rare occasion I have had to return something it has always gone incredibly smoothly although I have read they will ban customers who return too many items which is slightly off putting. I like Amazon but just don't use it as much anymore as it is no longer competitive with its prices and I don't like feeling ""had"" with hidden fees. I won't be renewing my prime membership.",1

Especially the vendors in china. Placed order on August 6 for an NFL blanket-still hasn’t arrived! Shop around. I make most of my purchases outside of Amazon. This vendor is Custom Shop Gift!?! Sounds like 🤬",1
ive had amazon for years so many problems like they charged me 4-6 times the same month for prime. When i talked to someone they act like they cant find out why they charged me so many times oh we cant see iit on our end when it cleary said amazon prime multiple times on my bank statement. also had many other weird charges from them. they also let the sellers do whatever they want even sell cracked wood for a bed lie on the description of thier products they have no protection for costumers at all. they seem to only care about the sellers. amazon is such a scam so after years of ordering and this bullcrap giving them many chances they now have blocked my account claiming that the card i pay with isnt mine or my husbands card. cant even get the prime payment refunded that i paid this month. never again do not use amazon,0

"There's no doubt: Amazon is amazing. The range, the reviews, the prices, the service, the convenience. But as someone living outside the U.S., I need more global shipping options. Perhaps 2/3 or 3/4 products do not ship internationally at all, at any price. If Amazon wants to provide the best service in the universe, I say come down to earth first. Let's get the global shipping options expanded then we'll talk about that colony on Mars.",2

"As a whole I have had a fine interaction with Amazon, but that changed today when I called and Mezagreg (?) answered. I will take responsibility for halfway listening (working) to his question and answering him, but there is no excuse for chastising a customer for the way they talk. I  showed frustration for a situation that I'm dealing with and having an Amazon representative try to control me and the way I talk is crossing the line. He even laughed with amusement telling me to be professional (the customer). Then he hung up on me.  The next representative told me what he wrote explaining the call which was not the truth. I am sick of customer support representatives abusing the customers because they know they can hangup on us with the support of the company. How can a customer get help or ask a question if the people answering the phone has it out for us even before they answer. No care for the customer anymore.",1
"I've had an average interaction with Amazon.com. The site offers a vast selection of goodss, and it's generally easy to find what I'm looking for.

Prices are usually competitive, but occasionally I find better deals elsewhere. Overall, Amazon.com is convenient for many purchases, but there is definitely room for improvement in their order and customer support supports.",1
Love em! Great company with exceptional service and prices.,2
"Purchase an item on the 24th aug 2023 , item was being sold by Amazon eu and advertised as in stock at time of sale . After sale I was informed delivery time to be confirmed. Nearly every day since purchase item has been advertised as in stock by Amazon eu . After contacting Amazon I was informed that the item was not in stock and also told that (in stock ) does not mean the item is in stock . Hear is what happened on 11/8/23 , the item said 13 in stock and while speaking the phone a Amazon advisor was able to tell me that there was now only 12 available while we were speaking, I asked the advisor could I not have one of the 12 and was told that is not how it works (lol) . So I pay for the item and Amazon won't deliver it but won't deliver it when it is clearly in stock and can't provide a delivery date . So if you see a item you like and is in stock, understand that the term (in stock ) written on a advertisement on Amazon platform does not actually mean (in stock) and what it does mean is very unclear.",0
"All I ever seem to hear from other scarred ex-Customers of Amazon is that they will never use Amazon or Amazon Marketplace again.Having returned £152 (+£20 postage) two items to a Chinese Seller, quite simply, Amazon refuses to forward the refund for either sums of money.I have now spent since the items arrived in June, trying to resolve this issue; Amazon has an in-house Department called 'A to Z Guarantee' - quite cleverly, Amazon doesn't specify what the name implies; however, it appears to guarantee, no matter what, its Customers will NOT receive a refund NOR any explanation for their refusal.I have proof the goods were posted and have been assured on four separate occasions, the money had been refunded to my bank account; however, no money has been refunded.As it's nigh on impossible to find ANYWHERE one can scribe a negative review, making public Amazon's disgusting administration of their Customers; I can only guess Review sites are intimidated by the size and the power Amazon holds and are afraid to publicise the awful experience experienced by so many members of the public.",0
Love Amazon and have paid for an Amazon Prime account for years as it is well worth it with as often as my household uses it.,2
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1

"I absolutely love Amazon. They've been a very reliable hub to shop from, with absolutely no problems in anything I've purchased on their site (from the company itself nor the independent merchants).  I've bought books, computer hardware, games, music, jewelery, guitar accessories, and clothes from Amazon, and everything has been top notch service. Delivery estimates either exactly when they say, or my items arrived earlier than expected, and well packaged.",2
"Although I have been happy with Amazon's support and prompt shipment I noticed recently that they still sell real fur in some of their lines and make up brushes, as most fur is imported from China and former Soviet States with animals skinned alive, electrocuted and very much abused I do not think that such a popular site should have these items on its site, please consider an ethical overhaul of some goods lines",1
I always check Amazon first before going anywhere else.  Great deals and free shipping on most items!,2
"I too have had problems with Amazon deliveries at 10:00PM.  I repeatedly told them no deliveries after dark but the request is routinely ignored.  In addition to that their drivers insist on driving into my driveway and up to my gargage instead of parking on the street and walking up to the front door or garage door.  The driveway is narrow and there is insufficient room to turn their vehicles around to drive out in forward gear.  They must drive out in reverse, which many cannot do.  Consequently they have damaged my property by driving off the driveway and/or driving into the traffic cones and reflectors that I have placed along the driveway.  I more recently got a block to place at the end of the driveway to prevent them from driving in.  In response they began to leave packages at the driveway block which is about 8' from the street.  Packages have gotten wet and been snowed upon and hidden from view only to find damaged contents the next AM.   UPS and FedEx drivers are instructed NOT to drive into the customer's driveway and to park on the street.  I have no idea why Amazon cannot do the same. ",0
"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for many years, and I must say that my experience with this platform has been consistently outstanding. Amazon is a one-stop shop that offers convenience, a vast product selection, and exceptional customer service.The convenience of shopping on Amazon is unparalleled. From the comfort of my home, I can find virtually anything I need, and the user-friendly interface makes it easy to browse, compare products, and make informed decisions. The search and filtering options are incredibly helpful, ensuring that I can quickly find what I'm looking for.One of the standout features of Amazon is its fast shipping, especially for Amazon Prime members. The Prime membership has been a game-changer, with free and often same-day or two-day shipping available for a wide range of products. It's a great value for frequent shoppers like me.Amazon's product selection is unmatched. Whether I'm shopping for electronics, books, clothing, or groceries, I can count on Amazon to have a diverse range of choices. The platform also allows third-party sellers, which means I can often find unique and niche products.Customer service on Amazon has always been responsive and helpful in my experience. Any issues I've had with orders were quickly resolved, and the return process is straightforward. Their commitment to customer satisfaction is evident.Overall, I can confidently say that Amazon has made my life more convenient, efficient, and enjoyable. It's my go-to platform for shopping, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and customer-focused online retailer.Amazon's commitment to convenience, product selection, fast shipping, and excellent customer service has made it my preferred online shopping destination. It's a five-star experience, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Amazon to family and friends.",2

"Amazon has really dropped the ball this holiday season. The app sent an alert about a package being delayed with no expected shipment date. Upon contacting customer assistance, I was told it would be delivered on time. When it wasn't delivered, I aain contacted customer assistance to be told it would not be delivered until 4 days after Christmas.  I requested a refund at this time and was offered a promotional credit for the inconvenience.  I then contacted customer assistance because the promotional credit was not showing on the account only to find out the credit is only usable if I find and purchase a goods sold by Amazon specifically (not a vendor of Amazon). So purchase something I may not want just to use a ""credit"" applied? In other words, give Amazon my money. Getting pretty tired of the ordinary business with Amazon.",1
Their website is easy to use and they have pretty much what you're looking for if you can't find it else where.,2
Amazon has had so many hiccups over the year I question if even shipping here is worth it anymore.,1
If I could 0 I would Amazon has put a policy in place to refund money on the account after 30 days so basically they receive their item back  and they have the item in the warehouse and also had Ls your money for 30 days while you as a customer is paying interest on the purchase this is another level of taking advantage of costumer’s and holding costumers money hostage,0
I ordered from Amazon and Macy’s on the same Friday. Macy’s arrived the next Wednesday. I am still waiting on my order this Saturday morning. I have spoken to 6 customer service reps. Horrible. Was good for a while. Guess they got greedy.,0

"Amazon as a company has decided to limit free speech and free enterprise by limiting conservative apps from operating.  They have created a monopoly among the other tech giants and I am done giving them any more money.  I will take my business elsewhere.  Not to mention over half of what you buy on there site is junk.  They have been peddling made in china garbage far too long.  Quit selling out the American people and their businesses.

"Amazon has now put in affirm so they can pay monthly, sounds great till you read that it’s 10-30% interest on any product which means you are paying anywhere for 20 extra dollars to 100. Will not be using Amazon for any holiday shopping. They keep ripping off their customers",0

Please do not book your orders from amazon if you do not want to get harassed . It is 3rd time that the delivery boy marking false comments that he tried to deliver the order. He did not make single attempt to deliver the order and the amazon customer service was not even able to provide the delivery boy contact number. What a shame services. Go with Flipkart and save your mood and time.,0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Once again, Amazon's continued use of the United States Postal Service (USPS) has screwed me, too many times to count. You pay for GUARANTEED delivery by a certain date, but God forbid if you live in an apartment or condo complex. UPS and FedEx hand deliver all packages right to my door on time as they are supposed to, but not the laziest people on earth who work for the USPS. I get package delivery notices in my box requiring ME to travel 20 miles round trip to pick up my package, which will now be 2 days LATE at least before I have time to do so. I have registered complaints with Amazon but they do not care and REFUSE to hold the USPS to the same delivery standards as UPS and FedEx, but continue to say my delivery is GUARANTEED. BS! I have also asked them to tell me WHO will be delivering my package prior to placing my order, and again they REFUSE to change their policy and at least let me know that so I can go someplace else without this hassle. In the future anytime I see that USPS is my carrier I am cancelling my order and going elsewhere. Go to hell USPS, and you wonder why you are losing money. If you were a private company you would be out of business. Amazon should be ASHAMED of themselves for allowing them to continue to deliver sub-standard service compared to other carriers.",0

"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the order. Then they give you an approximate order date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1
Absolutely appaling company. Can not follow simple instructions. Packages have gone missing several times because Amazon can't be bothered to leave with  neighbour. And now they've implemented a stupid process of contacting the police and filing a report before they even look into the issues. Don't you think the police have better things to be dealing with than a parcel that someone picked up from outside my house that was incorrectly left by Amazon! Absolutely a disgrace. Should be shut down.,0
The past 2 times I have ordered I have either gotten the wrong items (they gave me a Kalmba instead of a book and dice) or get items in a different size than the size I ordered. Sometimes they get lazy and give me packages from another neighborhood with completely different addresses. And don't even try with customer service. They do not know English and do not help.,0
"my profile asks drivers to leave packages on porch but they just can’t seem to figure it out. This day in age you would think they would make an attempt to secure the packages but instead, they leave a skinny box standing vertical so the tallest side can be seen from down the block. it’s almost like they invite people to steal it!! Also, they didn’t ring bell and forged my signature as if i signed for it! Another less than fabulous performance by someone who makes too much money to do less than the minimum. Train your staff Jeff!",0
Amazon have the most helpful customer service I have ever dealt with by far. The wait times for amazon Australia customer support are less than 1 minute. This alone is unheard of but the people are really helpful and also sent an email after the call had finished detailing what was discussed so that you have it in writing if anything goes wrong. Best experience with customer support I’ve ever had. I can’t speak for international but Amazon Australia are amazing.,2
I have had several deliveries not arrive or get stolen before they reach me. I even had a delivery in an amazon locker which was stolen (empty box)!Customer service always addressed these complaints. Sometimes it wasn't 100% easy as the staff they hire (offshore) can be difficult to communicate with. But they always rectified things in the end.,2
"I have had a Prime account with Amazon for years and expect to have one for many years to come.  Even though they are not always the low-price retailer for an item, I still start by searching Amazon whenever I shop and will frequently buy a slightly more expensive item from them instead of buying from a lesser-known source.  Amazon's on-time delivery and excellent return policy can't be beaten.",2
Everything went well. Deliveries take some time tho. But overall pretty well.,1
"Pathetic AmazonI ordered L'Oreal Professionnel Serie Expert Liss Unlimited Evening Primrose Oil, 125ml and De Fabulous Shampoo, 250ml and Conditioner Reviver Set, 250ml on 05/09/2018 and both delivered to me on 06/09/2018 through Amazon Prime Delivery.When I opened the packet, I found that the bottles were not properly packed (sellotaped here and there) and there was leakage also. Oil was coming out of bottle. In fact it seems that these bottles were packed by someone from Amazon after getting them returned by any other customer. In my opinion I had been delivered product already used/returned by someone else.I had clearly read the policy regarding return/refund at the time of placing the order and I knew that product was not eligible for return/refund but I was not sure that I would be delivered such kind of already used/returned by some else product. I needed these product on urgent basis therefore I decided to get them delivered through Amazon Prime delivery and I paid extra money for that but what I got? Already used products… I never expected it from Amazon.I have paid my hard earned money to Amazon for these products and now I got defective products. I sent an e-mail to Amazon mentioning the issues I faced and attached pictures of the same. Next day I got an e-mail that ""on verification it was found that the products were damaged therefore refund would be issued"" and I was asked to update my account details, I updated my account details and on the very next day I was informed that the refund could not be issued as pictures are not clear.I sent pictures and numerous e-mails again and again but all in vain. I tried to contact customer care but my number was blocked. I tried chat option and they informed me that after examining pictures they haven't found any damage in the products. Amazon already examined the pictures and accepted that the products were damaged and on re-examining Amazon found these products good..what a joke..Amazon making fool out of me. It is requested everyone not to shop from Amazon as it is a fraud company. Pathetic customer care service.I am from hospitality background myslf...this kind of customer services I or any of my friends have never offered to anyone ..you should be ashamed of being serving customers like the way you are..Highly appalled..I will never recommend Amazon to anyone.",0
"Acquisto da amazon da ormai anni. Mai una pecca, un unico pacco ricevuto rotto all'interno, subito cambiato. Infallibile.Purchased by amazon for years. Never a foul, a single pack received broken inside, immediately changed. Infallible.",2
"I ordered an item for my granddaughter to use for prom and the reason that I ordered it from Amazon was because I could get it on Wednesday before we needed it on Saturday.  Well as of 6:00 on Friday, it still had not been delivered.  I called customer service and she checked with logistics and they said it was probably lost.  She said that she would refund my money and I told her that was fine as long as she did not cancel the order as there was a slim chance that we might receive the item.  She assured me it would not be cancelled.  Well, the order was cancelled.  I was livid!  Customer service is terrible and apparently cannot speak English good enough to understand what the customer is saying when they say DO NOT cancel the order.  Amazon used to be great but their shipping sucks now!!  Will never order anything important from them again.",0
"On the whole, I think that Amazon offers a great go to service for almost anything you may want or need. Sadly, there is a but..... if things go wrong the customer service team may not be as helpful as one would wish. I will still use this company as the positives of Amazon prime outweigh the disadvantages of one negative experience.",2
I have used amazon for years & have only had positive expirences with them.,2
"I have always received items as described and within acceptable time.  With such a variety of goods, it is a joy to dearch on Amazon - and there are some good offers.  Very helpful to pensioners like myself!",2
"Avoid amazon at all costs. You will always find items cheaper elsewhere.The delivery service has changed and takes a lot longer, yet they've increased the monthly charge, they are more concerned about taking contracts elsewhere than actually providing a service for its customers. So while it's customers pay more per month, amazon takes advantage of other companies like royal mail and fills in contracts over its own customers while you continue to lay a monthly charge. The website is full of fake and dangerous items.Amazon likes to show chinese made items. Filtering the high quality Western products over the Chinese.So you buy the crap and then return to buy again.Constantly returning items that don't workCustomer service attempting to enforce amazon's policies on me haha. No amazon, the public do not follow amazon's policies. The customer support are from South Africa and don't understand british consumer rights. And they attempt to enforce rules on you. Sorry this is the UK not Africa.",0
You can find ANYTHING here! At a very competitive price BUT...if I am ordering more than one item at a time...I shop elsewhere because items are shipped out from different places and the shipping is high :(,1
Sometimes orders came wrong not as descriptionbut overall nice prices according to the quality.,1
"I will leave Amazon.  They have a curated profile of who they want as customers and the tiers are quite obvious.  Their shipping system is dismal and random.   For so many people, Amazon simply cannot be bothered. The region they live in is not desirable to Amazon's accountants.  Profit is the ONLY motivation of Amazon. They shift all responsibility to the shipper, whose name they pull out of a hat.  Countless people that do not live in or near urban regions cannot reliably use Amazon.  I get endless refunds because my items never arrive.  Looking to join the obviously required class-action.",0
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the order. Then they give you an approximate order date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1
I've had many  Packages stolen  because  they  continue  to leave  my stuff  out back 4 my 76 year  old mom  to have  to walk  around  entire home to get!!! You can see pictures  of my delivery instructions on my Google  n or fb. Blessed  day  y'all...CLnChico2,0

parcels delivered by Amazon on Wednesday 22nd November 2023.Should have been delivered at my address. N2.didn't arrive but a neighour knocked.my front with parcels that had been left outside our building.And took this upon himself for delivering  all parcels.But the Amazon shipment person stated that he handed the parcel to the resident that's me.Marmag,1
they dropped phone support today.  not very customer centric.blinded sided everyone,0
"Overall acceptable site. Delivers when they say. The only issue I have is my card was replaced while in a trial of prime that was 1.99. When I went to update it, they didn't even let me finish my week of prime (I was only 3 days in) and they charged me 14.99 right away. So I paid 16.99 for a month in reality and customer assistance said because I used it. (Um like people do with a PAID trial) I was just basically out of that money. So I'll order again but never will I ever use prime again.",1
"I wanted to become an amazon drop shipper , they automatically deducted $39 from my account without my permission\Hoping, I will be  I.D verified via zoom so I can start selling , three dates and times were bookedNow they put me on review and appeal without confirming a dam date and time of the three zoom i.d sessions!!What nonsense ! been shoved around from pillar to post and all i want to do is sell and make frikken moneyI have 2.4k stock waiting in my spocket accout to go, please indicate for me in the chat which other sellers platform is more user friendly with customer support?absolute disgrace and Mr Bezos cares ......

Lots of my friends say they don't get 2 day shipping from prime. I not only get 2 day shiping I get like 24 hour shipping. I must live next to a shipping center. Lucky me!,2
"I love the convenience and awesome prices Amazon offers with Prime, but the times that i have received the goods later than expected are not rare. It's starting to feel less reliable and that's really frustrating for a Prime member who pays specifically to avoid these problems.",1
This site is very excellent and learning to make money for weeks.,2
"Excelent deals,  just the Real thing.  Record time for delivery. 2 days!!!!! Oh, man!I will keep using Amazon platform in the future.",2
Amazon always has my back. I’ve never had a bad experience with them and I order thousands of times with them. Always fast and accurate shipping and will correct any problems with a generous return policy.,2
"I paid 10 Euro for expedited delivery and they have sent my order with regular delivery which by the way takes at least a week, so I won't be getting my items for over 7 days. After talking to support for over 40 minutes, they issued a refund for shipping. Same thing has happened about 2 months ago.... Horrible experience and I won't order from them anymore. They are either scaming people on shipping fees or have incompetent underpaid workers. How can you screw up shipping out a product when that's your only job?",0
It is really acceptable for shopping!,1

Bought replacement batteries for my cell and it was fulfilled by Amazon.  Received the battery in less time then their expected delivery time.  Great communication and fast delivery. Pretty awesome in my book.,2
"I think Amazon is very good provides an amazing fast service, and they respond effectively. I bought 10 items already and I had no issues with them, it’s very good even if I had issue with it it’s nothing to do with amazon since they did they part 100% every single part and help me resolve the issues easy.",2

I bought a piece of equipment about four years ago that was junk from Amazon and the company that I had to send it back to you charge me $17 to have it shipped back to them I called Amazon and they assured me that they were going to give me a $17 credit which they say is on my account but every time I try to use it I cannot find it and when they help me they tell me I cannot use it this has been going on for three years and every time I chat with them all I do is get jerked around they should be ashamed of their customer service department,0
great company and good returns and easy to deal with,2
"I am very satisfied with AMAZON, because 80% of my orders arrive on time and they actually care about their customers!!",2
Amazon is going down hill fast with higher prices and unreliable delivery dates i find myself turning back to ebay who still has no membership fees,0
"Over the last 3 years I have had a few interactions with Amazon because I have my packages delivered to my work and they have delivered them to the wrong places, annoying my neighbours, as well as leaving items out in the open for 48hours! They know it is a business address, they even sent someone from customer services to see me. This time, they attempted to deliver on a Saturday night and failed. Now Tuesday night and still no re-attempt. The items were ordered on Thursday on a 1 day Prime delivery, so I should have had them by last Friday.Amazon is too big now, they just don't care. Use Amazon as the last option.",0
Customer Service total waste of time. Chat line asked for someone to call (a number which rings you then plays music - 10 times!) & spent 30 minutes on hold on & off with the agent (whom I could hardly understand) with a nonsense response. Expected much better customer service from Amazon so clearly they have a lot of improvements to do.,0

Amazon needs to be stopped by government for exploiting workers and retailers.They harbor horrific slave like conditions by underpaying and overworking staff and screwing suppliers.They debited my card for a subscription I didn't set up and refused to refund meAwful business.I hope Jeff Bezos never comes back from his space trip.,0
"Amazon have started charging £25 for some single items to be delivered. I have been shopping with Amazon for years, buying random bits but also buying essential things again and again. I went on today to order 3 things I buy nearly every month for the past 4 years, I got to the check out and it said delivery charges would be £75 - with the items not being delivered for over a week. I got in touch with Amazon Rep, and they simply said some sellers can charge anything they like for delivery costs! I mean a delivery charge of £25 for one item that costs just over £2? Really? I'm finished completely with Amazon - not that they'll care I'm guessing.",0
"Over the years I've watched amazon continue onto a decline. They lost my package, and trying to contact their support team was an absolute nightmare. At the end of it all I just sucked it up and moved along. Still, I do love the fast shipping and easy returns",1

"Two weeks ago I placed an order which was confirmed immediately after. However, the following day I received an email claiming there was unusual activity on my account so it was put on a temporary hold. I was promised a review within 24 hours but now, two weeks later, nothing has happened. So, I created a new account and placed an order but now the same thing has happened. There is no email address or local number I can phone without spending a fortune on an overseas call. I am so frustrated and if I could get my purchase somewhere else there's no doubt I would not be attempting to shop with Amazon.",0
Always like using amazon but waste of packaging for little items. Not very fine. Service is great though,1
Refund not returned within 7 days as promised. Live chat unwilling to help. Extended it to 14 business days and asked me to call back,0
Service is fine. easy to order.,1
Amazon is getting to be terrible about on time delivery. Product will sit at outgoing warehouse for 24-48 hours. Says delay in transit but has been sitting at outgoing warehouse.,0
"I have returned an item from Amazon market place. Amazon claims I returned an incorrect item, I do not have more information. Impossible to get through to the Team doing the enquiry as they do not communicate via phone unlike the customer service. Literally a joke for a company such as Amazon. Amazon is not refunding me and the item is with them…",0
Very fast shipping! Interested!,2
Excelent prices and good service. Great delivery. Congrats.,2
"Many people to talk to, but no one who can really help your issue. They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a ordinary mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",1

I ordered an e gift card. It was never sent. I have spent hours on the phone and chat without being able to get a refund. What the hell happened to amazon customer service? They used to be good. ,0
I had some time on my hands to though I would review some businesses that I think have offered a very good service during the lock down. Amazon is amazing I have ordered so many bits and pieces over the last few months and never had any problems.,2
"Awwww, so average usage with them. Paid online and got nothing!!!!",1
the buy and shipment is fine. but lately i reviewed some goodss that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing fine to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
"There have been many recent issues with Amazon customer service associates AND supervisors being incompetent, impatient and just generally unwilling to help because they honestly don't care. They recently lost a package of mine that happened to beat gift for someone else. Embarrassing already since I ordered it in advance to avoid any issues only to have to go through at least 20 different people telling me there's nothing they can do. The tracking information through UPS shows nothing, not even an acceptance scan and despite sending Amazon screen shots, I keep getting the same scripted, generic apology email telling me to wait another week. Except in every email, the date changes so no one knows what they're talking about. On my end, it shows the order was canceled and returned. They're not allowing me to get a refund and keep brushing me off. I already reordered another item myself and it was delivered to my family member no problem but now Amazon tells me if the other item gets delivered, they're supposed to refuse it? What if they're not home? Why is it now their problem because Amazon screwed up? I've talked to supervisors and ""specialists"" who are all just unwilling to help and actually hang up on me when I ask what I'm supposed to do. Original delivery date was 11/22, a day before their birthday. I reordered another item and it was delivered just fine on 11/23. The lost package, I'm being told to wait until 11/28 before Amazon will even think about doing anything.",0
I failed to receive 1/4 packages I ordered. They are AWFUL about actually getting things to you.,0
Nice website.Easy return and decent customer care.,1
"I have been ordering from Amazon for years...Items are always delivered and packaged well. Any issues are sorted quickly.  A couple of things I don't like...1. Some items are now sent from China. This means the quality is poor and delivery can take weeks2. Prices seem to have been increasing in recent years. It use to be a cheap place to shop, not so much anymore.",2
They are acceptable about some things but there are some thing on the site that when you buy the will not get back to you. They will take you money and not return it or get back to you on where it’s at.,1
"I do buy some items on Amazon, not too many.  Do not buy cosmetics, or anything lower cost that the Chinese can make, as there are thousands of fake items listed on Amazon.com. It is more expensive as well.  I find an item on Amazon, and find the exact seller and same item on EBAY for much less.  I tried to open a store on Amazon, it did not go so well.  Our money was held for a very long time (we did not get paid for months) and what we here this is the norm.  We also listed my Company phone number (expensive items) so customers could call to confirm we were the real deal. Most were asking for our number from Amazon, as customers of high end item want to Many want to talk to a human, not a computer.  Amazon did not like this, gave us a hard time, so we no longer sell on Amazon. Amazon is acceptable for sellers of low cost items that are somewhat standard, easy to spot a consumer, not high end or custom items that consumers want to discuss before a purchase.  While this could happen on Amazon, Amazon's Terms & Conditions make every item a ""Coke"", and if you are not selling a ""Coke"" forget it.",1
Solid company out of 178 deliveries from Amazon I have only had two problems with orders. Both were handled with pride and professionalism from Amazon. Very polite drivers and good customer service.,2
"My packages constantly get left at the wrong house. When my house # is clear as Day on my mailbox. And when my husband went outside and confronted the women delivering our package to my neighbors house he asked her if she had seen the house # on the mailbox and she said ""oh, we don't look at house #'s we only go by our GPS."" So now I have my items shipped to my gmas house and she is having the same problem as well as my mom. Horrible delivery with Amazon. Makes me not want to order from there.",0
"Amazing customer service. Not all the products they sell are quality, but they have always taken, within a reasonable amount of time, my returns if I wasn’t satisfied.",2
"I love Amazon,  Well i use to love Amazon. I hate to write a negative review for them , but this last item was just to much for me.  I ordered a floor mirror that is on a stand that you can adjust.  Well as i'm trying to put this thing together, (which i hate doing) following the instructions with these screws and o rings.  I find out i'm short an o ring, for the bottom part,  hoping that won't matter much, i press on.. then find out i'm missing a whole screw for the bottom part of the stand!!  WHAT THE HELL!!  Isn't this stuff suppose to be checked ?  I am done ordering furniture thru these places online and having to put it together your self. It's bull##!#, there's always something that's wrong with it, if it's not missing parts, then it's wobbling, just not strong enough. And then returning it is a whole nother headache. I guess i'll go to the furniture store and buy it whole, and have it delivered.   Very, very, disappointed.",0
"I had an account with Amazon for a while, but didn't use it very often. I was able to shop in December and later during the holiday season I received an email that my account was blocked and I need to confirm it within 24 hours. There was no explanation as to why this is happening etc. On December 26th, I was sitting with my family not checking my email!s Today on January 8th I tried to buy something again, but couldn't. When I called for help, they couldn't enter my post code so they were not able to check what was wrong. I ended up having my account blocked for a reason that was not given to me and the help center was unable to help. No other platform has put me off as much as Amazon. If you don't want me as your customer I will go somewhere else.",0
"Being an amazon prime member, I assumed purchasing items you would get your items shipped as told. Well, looks like I was wrong I ordered my items on the Dec. 16 were suppose to get them today haven’t received them yet. UPS states they won’t be here till the 21.",0
I love all the servicez we get from Amazon. From prime 1 day to prime video to even grocery delivery now. What couldn't you love? I don't necessarily agree with all their business practices but I love my 1 day shipping.,2
"Updated review Updating my review from yesterday.So I am not going to let that one guy in my below review make me think that all of Amazon is bad. Yes amazon still inconvenienced me with the issue from yesterday but they made up for it today. This is the type of service I expected from only Amazon which is why I’ve been a prime customer for the past 10 years.Original review Wow... I’ve been a prime member for 10 years and have never had the customer service experience I just had. I ordered something yesterday that was time sensitive. I added to my cart more products than I needed to make sure it would meet he threshold for one day “guarantee”. I told them I didn’t care about the other two items but I needed that one item by tomorrow (which is today). Anyhow at 5:30, amazon tracking said it would come by 8pm. At 7:30, it said it would come by 9pm. I realized around 9:30 that it never came and now tracking said it will arrive within next two days. I called to see if there was anything they could do to make sure it can arrive by noon tomorrow. I felt like this was a fair request since they failed to deliver today as “guaranteee” on their site. He said “I can’t re route everything JUST for you package”. That was a really rude and unlike Amazon reply. After he said that, he got me in a fighting mood and I said so your “guarantee” is basically false advertising. He said “no if you ACTUALLY read our site... we are covered by that”. I was like “Hugh... I cannot believe Amazon is letting you represent them”. He also said at some point when he was reviewing my account  that I did not pay for this shipment  but after I hung up on him mid convo bc I was done dealing with his ignorant attitude, I realized that yes I do pay for shipping. I pay for prime for over $100 a year. Are you actually telling me that a non prime member is more valuable than a prime member? Anyhow... I am all for American jobs because is my country but it seems like those working in the other countries are WHOLE LOT more courteous and customer service focused. This “lead” seemwd like they jut pulled him off he street with his nasty attitude. I did call Amazon again to talk to another supervisor to make sure he “Dan” gets reprimanded. Anyhow “Dan” gave away a lot of Amazon’s inside scoop and how they think about their clients now. They value non-prime members more; their “guarantee” is not real and the verbiage on their site covers their guarantee not being real somewhere in fine print, and they are too big to care for you as client anymore. Also After speaking to this guy who was on the east coast in the US, their hiring decisions have declined because he was the worst.",2
"Amazon, as many people will probably agree, is very useful and inexpensive. You can find a mixture of good and bad products. I will say, even though Amazon's cheap, remember to check other sites, because I was looking for a Disney animator doll, and on Amazon it was more expensive than on shopdisney (It's gone down in price now on Amazon, but point is, at the time it was more expensive, so don't just trust Amazon to give you the CHEAPEST offers.) I like the fact that if there's a problem with a product, they'll let you return it.",2
"I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on goodss on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive interactions with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.",1
I purchased a oil painting pai t by numbers.  Cost about $30.00 the seller is a third-party.  Amazon has not supported my efforts to get a refund.  I have not received my order. Its now 3 months ago.  Amazon has made it impossible to get a working phone number.  I guess this company gets to treat a customer anyway they want.,0
"You shop on Amazon.  You find what you want.  One of the reasons you shop here is because of their shipping.  You place your order because Amazon promises your package will be delivered on a certain day.  Then you wait because your package doesn't come.  After they take your money and send you a confirmation telling you when you will get it, you don't get it, and you get an email saying sorry it's late, and if you don't get it by this day, you can have your money back.",1
"Amazon continually promises to deliver by certain date. They continually fail to meet their obligations. Many times have I experienced this and is a prime member I am thoroughly disgusted. This is an example, I ordered two items for delivery between before 11:00 AM this morning. Upon checking on Amazon there was a display that said packaging on be there scheduled by 3:00 PM now. I order you in good faith and Amazon does not deliver.Now I have to rearrange my schedule because Amazon did not keep their schedule yet once again. I feel like they say we'll deliver it by this date and then just don't.",0
"Good items on sale! Any of those didn't show up as ""average"" or ""disappointing"", and I've been satisfied with most of my orders.Still, I wrote a review about a item to the seller, it has been two weeks, and it is not on the item reviews. My opinion is important, and they just cant appreciate it? Whatever, keep your junk without.",1
"They have their ups and downs but they aren’t the worst company in the world. When I need certain things I can’t find elsewhere, Amazon holds a spot as the ‘fallback shop’.",1
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the goodss supplied. It's Amazons own order assistance that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1
"My wife ordered an item on from Amazon on 21 September.  On 23 September she received an email update that item was shipped.  On 26 September, online tracking said ""package expected today"" (26 Sept.).  Did not happen.  On 27 September onsite tracking says ""item may be lost"" and gave me a link to request a refund but also states item might may still be delivered but no estimate.  Very confusing.  I waited wait until end of day no delivery  so requested a refund. I clicked the refund icon. A refund did not process.  Instead, a message came up that if item is  not delivered by Tuesday (29 Sept.), I can request a refund or replacement. Still waiting-seem to be getting the runaround.  The item in question is needed to complete some Fall landscaping chores - cannot wait for ever.",0
I love the fact if you get prime you get free shipping.i don’t like there return policy cause to me when a adult toy messes up I wouldn’t want it back as for Amazon they want it sent back. I love that you can get on Amazon and practically get anything you want from toilet paper to motor oil.,1
"As A prime member I supposed to have a two days delivery for an item to be delivered.  It took five days to arrive.  The worse things is the tracking number changed every time  the day and the hours of delivery.  I could not leave my home for two days waiting for the item to arrive.  After many calls, finally my package arrived.I will never ever buy anymore from Amazon.  They don’t have any respect for their client.",0
"Hello and goodbye. I was a new Amazon customer since, but I'm leaving now, because I'm an American!",0
I use Amazon for almost everything at this point. Couldn't live without it.,2
"I use Amazon extensively, but their digital purchase experience is driving me to look at other options. Hate to leave my Kindle library behind but...I need to purchase digital content on 2 different credit cards. Amazon offers only 1 Click Buy now option for digital content. This forces me to click 16 times in order to switch credit cards each time I buy digital content on a different card. Driving me nuts. Just let me add it to the cart and choose my purchase method.",0
"1) Amazon should have a shipping options. They have only 2 options, 1 which is 24 hours or less and is very expensive, 2 the normal shipping is 2-3 days and can be expensive for some ,like myself who would be willing to wait 7-18 days and pay much less for shipping.     I just made an order 22 days ago and the order was supposed to arrive Dec.23 in time for Xmas,in paying they asked if the UPS can bring my order on Saturday or Sunday, with a click option for each.I clicked ""not on Saturday"", they delivered it on SATURDAY when no one was home and the whole order package was returned to Amazon.22 days later I had to contact customer  support which were very nice in offering to give me back the same amount of money I paid them 22 days before, I am sure they do this and make many $$$millions simply on $Money free interest which they invest in Amazon free loans from we buyers.(I still have not yet received my refund)",1
"Amazon always comes through for all my shopping needs and I mean ALL! I would have given them 5 stars and almost gave them 1 star for one very unfortunate reason... LASERSHIP!! I've called and complained that the MUST stop using them for deliveries. UPS, USPS and FEDEX all work! Anytime they use Lasership my packages arrive as late as 2 weeks if at all (and I'm paying for Prime) OR they arrive opened and clearly ""handled""! They don't even have the decency to wrap things up properly again just shoving it into the box and delivering packages clearly ransacked! I don't know how LASERSHIP stays in business. I've given Lasership a bad review as well but its Amazon that needs to stop using them!",0
Ordered something on prime for delivery yesterday. Said it would delivered by 10pm and was on the phone to customer service who might I add are very rude and spoke to me like I was stupid. Offered no resolution to my issue. Take money for prime but don’t fulfil their and when it comes to delivering. ,0
"I purchased an incorrect item back in Nov 2018. Upon opening the package, I realized my mistake. I immediately applied for a refund, got my refund code, prepared the package to be sent back, and paid for the shipping back to the seller.I contacted Amazon in mid-December after I realized the package had been delivered but my refund had not been received. They told me it could take some time and that they would take care of everything. I left it at that.I had not received anything nor heard from Amazon into early January, so I contacted them again. I got the same response but they were escalating it to their complaints department. Great?!?! now I had to wait for them to get back to me again.I had not received any communication since contacting Amazon earlier in the month. I was getting annoyed. I contacted them for the third time and I got the exact same run around that I was given earlier. I was given three days to hear back from Amazon to see if I can even get my refund.It went from a simple return to the potential I won't even get it. Leaving the seller with both my money and the product. Every agent I spoke to had no information and no power. They couldn't do anything. Useless and a waste of time.I have since deleted all my accounts",0
"always good , not a lot more to say",2
"Prime ..I agree with other posters here and other sites. Prime is no longer the 'next day delivery' promised. In fact paying Prime is now rip off becaue deliveries are the same without paying for it. In effect its a wste of money.Prime offers other  benefits --so they say . Music .. theres a rotten selection and only there to force you into subscribing to their millions of songs library . Its cheaper and better to get Spotify and forget Amazon music altogether.  During this year the music selection has been reduced continually . Now its useless. Asking for a song gets the generic response 'Heres a  station you might find if your lucky what you are lookng for '  Generally you dont . so thats another waste of time.Linking Spotify to the Echo account used to be easy . Now they make it difficult to force you into the poor Amazon Music.Amazon Prime Videos . another free benefit!!!   It offers nothing more than a few old movies . Far better is available elsewhere. Netfilx is FAR superior and at the same subcription price . Amazon is no competitor.Finally the Echo units 'age' and become deaf. I have 4 ... YES FOUR , in different continents and they all suffer from the same deafness problem. In my opinion its an inbuilt planned problem designed to make you buy another later version.  Dirty business practice.I wouldnt buy another echo..ever. I recommend you dont either.Nor would I subscribe to Prime. tyhose who have already done so would be well advised to review any benefit . They like me and others will conclude theres no value and cancel for refund",0
Amazon is a great company but their items are quite expensive,1
"Amazon has now put in affirm so they can pay monthly, sounds great till you read that it’s 10-30% interest on any product which means you are paying anywhere for 20 extra dollars to 100. Will not be using Amazon for any holiday shopping. They keep ripping off their customers",0
"Amazon's onboarding process as a potential seller is horrible! For a couple months I have been trying to list items. Amazon has sent me emails numerous times that my account is verified and I am ready to list.However, when I try to list (via adding a product not sold on Amazon) I get this, ""Problem with your Seller AccountYou’re currently unable to add or edit listings because either the credit card on file is invalid or the credit card is in the process of validating, which could take up to 24 hours. Please ensure that you have a valid credit card uploaded in Account Settings.""I have quadruple checked my credit card info matches my legal identity. That everything matches up 100%. Not only that I use this card on a daily basis. I also use it with my Amazon prime account (under the same account) often! But, am considering dropping my prime account based on this experience.I keep getting canned responses that don't help and have requested phone calls more than once and not received one.Absolutely horrible!",0
"I find Amazon generally supplies acceptable customer assistance, acceptable prices and deliveries. However, the continual tricks used to trip people up when placing orders, making other methods of order (such as choosing prime) so bold and prevalent and presenting things in a confusing manner very frustrating.Prime, is only any acceptable for deliveries coming from Amazon itself. Music, TV and other assistances are only given to tempt you to pay more to see the rest of the TV series or the music track you really want to hear. Take music for example. Amazon music is free with advertising, to a degree. Then you have music prime with no add’s. But to get the full Amazon music, you have to pay again. No thanks Amazon.",1
"Great company, amazing customer service",2
Amazon are the best shopping experience ever. Their customer service is second to none and you can virtually buy anything from here and always at a cheaper price.,2
Prices suck sometimes and shipping is awful unless you have prime.,1
The shipment hours aren't guaranteed anymore you order early for 6 - 10pm shipment check back Amazon has changed day & time to when you aren't home. Ordered also for Sat 1pm shipment all 5 items lost in transit. I have to wait 5 - 7 days for money back when Amazon never dispatched items.,1
I recently purchased wall posters from Amazon. Good price and stuff got delivered in 3 days. Great website to buy almost anything.,2
"I love this company! They have the best customer service ever, super fast shipping, and easy to use website interface. It's my go to site for basically everything:)",2
They were quick with my delivery.My second order was missed due to me not being home I was able to call and they said they always do a re-delivery up to 3 attempts.It was great I got my order on schedule.,2
"For 20 years I used Amazon and their customer service was always great. This year however, they were very condescending when I needed their help, and made me deal with a problem they caused on my own. Now I try as much as possible buy from other services and avoid Amazon. Very disappointed",0
Find amazon to be fine but I have prime and next day shipment but even when its listed as next day shipment I didn't get it next day was apposed to recive item today but instead its coming another day  I have checked to make sure item was prime shipment and it is this has happened few times,1
I think it's very convenient. I think it has the largest number of product listings in the world. The only thing that would make it better is if the shipping costs were lower.,2
I ordered an important package that was supposed to come a week before it came.,1
Admin thanks ,2
"I have just read ""How to Unleash your Greatness"" by Rose Chikodzore and feel inspired to write a review.Such a good book,easy to read with great tips and personal stories of people who have  overcome their fears, weaknesses, and failures in order to accomplish their dreams.  It has challenged me to stop procastinating and doubting my ability, but to step out courageously to see my dreams fulfilled. Thank you Rose for the challenge and hope that your book has imparted to me.",2
"Excellent overall except their prices are not the cheapest always, a lot of times you could get much better deal at walmart or jet or ebay or even target or dollar store so make sure not to blindly suscribe to items without comparing prices. Retail king but walmart is catching up with free 2 day shipping and discounts for pickup as well.",2
Amazon cannot provide reliable customer service that will not lie to you. They qithold my packages for absolutely no reason and then garuntee my package here on the same day and it never shows up. I can never get any answers out of their rediculous customer service team other than it's not my fault and we are too lazy to do their jobs.,0

"I was only a customer of Amazon and then I started selling. 2 different experiences in my opinion. As a customer it's fine but don't do business with Amazon if you're a seller. They will screw you over. I was trying to sell a product but decided I'd go with a different platform so when I submitted the return of the products from their warehouse, they ended up sending all of it to some stranger in another state. They gave away thousands of dollars worth of my product and I still haven't been compensated me for it. I just get those stupid automated responses from their help who apparently don't even know how the site is run and are of no real help since they are all outsourced workers. I'm planning to take legal action so I can get back what was taken due to their major screw up.",0
"My Amazon Fresh order was due to be delivered between 12 and 2 pm on the day of delivery.When the order didn't arrive by 2pm I contacted customer services. The first representative told me that they couldn't get in contact with the driver and asked me to try - I couldn't contact the driver either. They then said they were going to refund the order. I agreed. Later they said that the driver was ""in my area"" and would be no later than 4pm ""Max"".Due to the cost of living I didn't have the budget to go and buy more food so I only had the option to take more time out to wait in for the delivery.It didn't arrive by 4pm.I then contacted customer services again who told me that a FREE replacement would be sent out by midnight the same day. After a very long wasted day, time taken off work and an autistic son waiting to be fed, the replacement order arrived by 11:30pm.Today Amazon has taken the payment of £40 despite promising a full refund of the order.I contacted customer services again today and that representative told me that I would be charged the £40 and there was nothing that could be done about it.This has caused stress for both me and my son. I have written to customer services on the email address they provided but that was a few days ago, and they haven't even acknowledged receipt of my email. Needless to say I won't be ordering food from them again and will likely cancel my Prime membership also. Don't bother buying a Prime membership. Doesn't make a shred of difference tbh. And get your food elsewhere.",0
So I changed my phone number and also got a new phone and couldn’t get into my Amazon. I had things in my cart but nothing I needed went thru all the security questions with no problem and was still told Thst my account is locked because the agent tried to many times and it locked so I needed to call back in 4 hours and go thru being on hold and answering all the questions again. Due to that I cancelled my prime account and that’s that. The customer service was terrible from the two agents I got before the supervisor who was actually nice.,0
"I have just purchased some items from amazon to be shipped to my overseas home, I used to think amazon was great for fast delivery however, my latest order has still to arrive and for love nor money I cannot get to an online section on the amazon site to cancel the order (I have given up waiting over 1 month for it to arrive).  Come on amazon - just because you have shipped something and passed it onto the post office doesn't mean your responsibility ends there.  It is very frustrating to wait this long for 1 item and to not be able to do anything about it except wait.  The message - be careful when shipping items outside US/UK as they pass items on to local post offices who are not always the quickest in the world - which is why we choose amazon to use someone like UPS or Fedex who will actually ship something on time!!  Cost saving in postage is a short term gain but not a long term gain for my repeated custom...",0
Could do better. Not always the most practical option for the purchase of decents. When multi buying a compromise on post and shipment should be considered.,1
Their prices aren't really too competitive anymore. The shipping has gotten pretty average shipping through USPS. Common sense says not to ship through such a dysfunctional government run shipment support. I've had packages delayed and even packages not show up when shipped through USPS when ordering from Amazon. When they use their own shipment people and UPS or Fedex there's no problem. But since things get shipped through USPS there's no way to get compensation or any kind of resolution to USPS's incompetency.,1
Bought some acceptable/average items,1
"We order all books, download TV shows & Movies, dog toys, hair care, gluten free food, ect. Every time I walk into a electronic store I double check to see if Amazon has a better price and they usually do. I even bought a $2 mouse pad from Amazon the other day. Free Shipping & No Tax, straight to my door in 2 days. Can't get easier and cheaper then that!",2
I take back the negative review of my beloved Amazon.....Amazon is truly AMAZING !!!! I will ALWAYS shop through Amazon and highly recommend to everybody !!!!!,2
What was needed was a birthday gift to a friend . He wanted a music column . Fortunately on GearBeste was a discount on this musical column . The quality of its sound for the money we are satisfied . Sending your order and order was fast . Thank GearBest and mail :),1
Bought an item off amazon that was defective. Went online and got a swap of product and I clicked the dhl pick up return. The airwave bill did not exist. Called amazon they could not help only sent me an email that directed me to another number. Called that number they said it’s the wrong amazon number and could not help. Then got sent an email to rate there service. Pressed no it said sorry your account dose not exist. First and last perchase from amazon.,0
"There was a mix up with the payment arrangement from a previous payment method that I use before this transaction the computer obviously had use the old payment. After the representative looked at it closely he Realize that there was a mistake, so consequently I got the stuff that I ordered and everything worked out just fine. I love it when a plan comes together. Thank you, Amazon.",2

Amazon delivered my package on the wrong porch! 😤 Now I have to go next door and look like a PACKAGE THIEF!! 🤦🏽‍♀️,1
"My parcel was left outside the main multi occupancy building again because they couldn't be bothered to bring it to my own personal front door. I have ostio arthritis in both knees and hips. I live at the end of a corridor. It is quicker for a fit person to delivery to my door than for me to go all the way along a corridor and down into the lift to the ground floor and having to bend to retrieve my parcel from outside the main door where anyone can take it. We have a small carpark outside and although private we do have people who are not a resident come and use it. The parcel could be taken by anyone.I have paid for delivery to my door. It has not been. They either don't know how to use the panel to gain access or they can't be bothered. Therefore I should not be charged delivery. I am thinking to cancel my account because of this. All I ask is that if I am paying for delivery, please deliver to my own personal door and not outside a multi occupancy building.",0
"The last year, before covid19 support at Amazon has gone downhill.  Two of my recent orders were not new boxes, contents unusable not as advertised.  Waited for order, return an no credit back to my charge card, only credit at amazon.  Fine, placed orders to use credit and told I would have to wait a month for order of in stock items. Done with amazon",1
"Package never arrived, but the customer service rep was very kind and understanding. He got me a replacement in 24 hours. 5 Stars are for that particular customer service rep. Very impressive service.",2
I always receive my products one time I requested a refund and they granted it.,2
Excellent customer service . Easy to contact them . Their online chat service is very helpful and reliable with experienced staff who can always sort out any issues that I might have . Their contact services are 100percent more efficient than eBay who are impossible to contact right now . I know I can rely on Amazon at all times to help me sort out any issues and their staff are both experienced and friendly . I can honestly say that they have always helped me if I needed them too .,2

One of the best e-commerce companies in the world,2
"PROS:* Fast delivery on most products.* Refunds very easily resolved.* Good(ish) customer service.* SO much choice.CONS:*Annual fee - Lets be honest, is this really necessary? £79 is steep. I mean its good having prime video but I would be quite happy just to pay £25 a year (example) for prime shopping.*Some products (mostly electrical) seem to be of poor quality. I have brought several electrical products (known brands) only for them to fail upon setup. Quite alarmed at the quality. Refund was swift but I am cautious to buy anything electrical now via Prime.",2
"Stop with the thinly veiled racist commercials. One depicting a black woman as medusa, the other depicting a black man as a horse. Disgusting. Just focus on delivering packages on time.",0

"This review is being put here as seems impossible to get in touch with Amazon about a driver.When you see a NO turning sign on a private drive and bollards in place you dont expect Amazon driver to reverse into driveway, get out and MOVE the bollard so can turn around and then not replace it.All other drivers who deliver here reverse up the road..  obviously by looking at state of the vans i guess a lot of the drivers cant reverse a van that big",0
I order from amazon.com all the time! My hubby says I'm addicted...I admit it! They have everything you can think of and always ship on time! Amazing company.,2
best courier services,2
FAST PRIME SHIPPING. ,2
The absolute worst. They have forgotten that the biggest retailers stand because of the power of the consumer. Falsifying delivery is not the way to go. Especially when they are quick to debit your credit card. Automated chats and voice calls are an insult to the consumer. Gladly taking my business elsewhere.,0
I ordered a book and the item arrived in 48 hours. I am very happy about the service from Amazon UK.,2
Amazon has been around since my college days. That’s when only students could use prime. I have a love hate relationship with them. Yes I know they f’ up but they also fix the issue too. I have no complaints specifically that I can even think of.,1
Everything I have done through Amazon  has always been fine and their accounting  and refund system is very well organised.  Makes internet shopping worthwhile.,2
Normally very decent but the last 2 orders have not gone well one never arrived and other came damaged managed to get they swapped but it took allot of emails and hassle might shop local going forward,1
"Delivery service is disgraceful.  As a prime member you are offered same day, day delivery and standard next day delivery for a large number of items but when I pick day delivery it changes as the day goes by to evening, changing every few hours. Also, I have waited for orders which end up being delivered later by a few days to a week.Calling customer service is useless. All they do is apologise and apologise.  It's exhausting.",0
Always had a great interaction except for the one last time. i will come back edit this review if I have a fine interaction next time.,1
"I ordered a garden shed on Amazon when it’s arrived it was too ugly to go into my garden. I contacted Amazon to get a return label and when I carried the shed that weigh 30 kg plus to the post office they told me that the postage was not covered, I contacted Amazon. They assured me they would get back to the seller who would contact me within two days to arrange return of the goods. Now six weeks later, I am being told by Amazon that The order was placed under a different email address and they can only deal with that person. I have pointed out to them that there must be 100 orders before and since that order all placed under the same email address the same delivery address using the same card. I have spent over 50 hours trying to get my money back I’ve been told on two occasions that they would force the third-party to return my money within seven days which hasn’t happened. I have wrote three letters to their managing director and finally I had an answer over the phone this evening.. The person on the phone has given me absolute no confidence of me getting my money back. He’s saying it can’t be looked at under GDPR The order was placed under a different email address and I’m asking him how that’s happened when all the other orders are showing placed under the right email address. I’ve also asked him when when I applied to return the goods why it came out off my orders on the app making it very difficult for me to take the matter up with their customer services. I am also very concerned that the third-party that I placed my order with on the Amazon website have ceased trading and why Amazon allowing companies that do not trade to sell on their website. The guy on the telephone could not answer that question said he would report it, but I would hear nothing back as it would stay an internal matter. this is clearly not good enough and they as they are not protecting their customers.",0
appalling customer serviceJust pull the plug instead of helping,0
So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years and when they say your package is arriving or it’s going to be delivered then that’s what it is. So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very ordinary business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,1
"Their delivery is terrible. You pay for Prime. You pay extra money for same day delivery. Wait up till 10:00 pm because they say it will deliver by then and then nothing. You track the package and it was 15 minutes away for 8 hours! You call customer service and they don’t care. Just another company that is about profits, not people. This happens all to often now. Amazon used to be good. Now it’s like a high end Wish.",0
"I recently bought a monitor on Amazon, it was marked as A rated for energy consumtion. Little did I know this was on the old classification and and when it arrived it was rated F. I would not have considered it with that rating so until Amazon get all the ratings for outside sellers corrected I would reccomend checking the manufacturers website.I kept the monitor because after speaking to the seller, I was satisfied it was not their fault. I wrote a review for Amazon but it may not have been accepted by them as it was critical of them.",1
I love Amazon an the wide range of products they have. I tend normally to   check the products in the stores and then by them in Amazon cheaper..,2
I'm on a call with Amazon now about a return and the advisor on the call has one of the best customer services telephone manners. I've experienced similar with Amazon before as well so appears like a consistent thing. Great to know they've kept their customer first tradition.,2
The best customer service and high bar for all companies. Quick deliveries and if a package gets lost by the carriers they make the process to send a replacement really easy. Prime is the best!,2
"They can update a website, filter category is not helpful",1
"i feel amazon is a good website,I bought many things from Amazon downloads and E books as well.Everything I've bought has come very quickly and many of them have been free p&p.",2
"I don't understand why this has so many bad reviews, its epic hard to break and i think amazon is pretty good",2
Amazon has the WORST customer service. These people truly make it known they don’t give a *%#^ about you or the issue that you are experiencing. Also many of these people are so incompetent that I would rather be dealing with a primate.,0
"Amazon has changed the way retail and shopping is done. They have great customer service, amazing return policy,  and their 1 and 2 day shipping are fantastic. The website itself, is maybe not the best, and can get a bit difficult to search for certain things, but overall, they are an amazing company and one that continues to change our lives.",2
"Package never arrived, but the customer service rep was very kind and understanding. He got me a replacement in 24 hours. 5 Stars are for that particular customer service rep. Very impressive service.",2
Very responsive customer service! always looking after your satisfaction. They just have almost everything you are looking for ;)Shipment tracking is amazing and so detailed! Try it - Adopt it.,2
Zero stars isn't possible. What a b dot s dot company. Something with 'cs-screenshots at amazon dot nl' No reply from them. Shipped back to China for almost 27 euro's. NEVER AGAIN! BOOOOOH!,0
"We are Prime members and have received good service from Amazon over many years,,,,,,Until we decided to use their Morrisons food delivery. We placed order with Amazon on sat 4th Dec 2021 and we were informed of the same day delivery which we did not need so said that Sunday the 5th would be acceptable.We were allocated 2.00pm to 4.00pm delivery slot.We were informed it was out for delivery at 2.10pm.We were then informed at 4.00pm that the order was cancelled.We would have accepted a late delivery as we had waited in already.I am suspicious that if someone had picked it in the store and loaded it on a vehicle, why not deliver it a bit late. Did they actually pick it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am sorry to say that we will never shop in Morrisons again as we have sometimes in the past and it does put Amazon in a bad light.I think Amazon needs to move away from Morrisons....That food was for our evening meal which created a problem,,,,,",0

My order was late but they made sure I had every update about the package when it was on the way to Amsterdam.,1
Amazon prime is just becoming a joke. They make you wait home all day and continuously tell you it will be delivered by 10pm and then all of a sudden it’s got an unexpected delay and will be with you in a few days. It’s not the service you pay for and the customer service reps just say don’t worry you will get it in a few days. It’s not exactly the service I’m paying for when it’s meant to be next day or the day I’m choosing. More than 50% of my deliveries run into unexpected delays. They just make too much profit to care about losing customers nowadays.,0
It is confusing to analyze if the seller is legit.,1
"Great company.  However, some workers with accents do not understand at all what I am calling about.  I wish we had the option to pick who we would like to talk with do that we can be understood.",2
"Awful! I pay Amazon Prime every month for free 2 day shipping. When I place my order I get an estimate of when my package will arrive. Many times I'm notified days later that they have revised my arrival date to days later of the original date. DON'T LET THE 2 DAY SHIPPING FOOL YOU. Your package is shipped when Amazon is able to get it. You may order something that's eligible for prime shipping and not actually get it until 2 weeks later.What if you get a damaged package? Amazon will refund your money but you either not get the package or have to send it back. If your shopping for a pet, your much better off using Chewy. Their shipping is free and quick. If they screw something up, not only do they refund your money, but they let you keep the package. If your trying to reach someone on Amazon in regards to customer service. Good luck! You have to go through a bunch of automated crap before you can even talk to someone.",0
I purchased a Nespresso machine from Amazon. The machine was faulty.Amazon replaced it for new one . After arranging 2 times to have the old one collected no one came to pick up the old machine. After calling Amazon they agreed I could keep the old machine . But to then a couple of weeks later to take payments for new machine . Leaving me with fees to pay because my account didn't have enough to money to pay some bills.They gave me £10 credit to use for Amazon a purchase.But doesn't help with my fees outstanding on my bank account. I'm not happy.,1

"To the attention of Jeff BezosAmazon Corporate Headquarters410 Terry Ave. North, SeattleWA, 98109-5210 jeff at amazon.comREPORT TO Business Bureau SEXUAL and racial discrimination from AmazonDear Mr. Bezos,Once again your company has failing in every dimension, as you may well know from all the cases opened against it in BBB - and systematically ignored.I understand, that mission of Amazon, is to fail you customers every time, all the time. However your customer DISSERVICE has really crossed a line. You should have not done it.As you may be aware, there has been an ongoing case for a fake issue gift card by your companyThis has been going for one year. Only yesterday 10th November 2022, you have officially recognized, that selling fake part is part of the way they work as testified by the Email from November 10th 2022On the date 27th August 2022, I called for the 10th time, your “customer disservice teams” to get an update, on where we were on the Gift card issue.As my own experience has proved, that the customer service is useless, I asked to talk directly to the Supervisor.That “Supervisor” wanted to identify myself and asked for my nameI told my name: Andrea.After hearing that, he denied any further support and denied identification, given that: “Andrea is a female name, and I had a male voice”I could not believe to my ears, so I told him, I pretended not to have heard that and to find a better excuse. He kept insisting that I was not the account holder because I was a male and Andrea is a female nameOn top of the never-ending ignorance, your “Supervisor” took the decision to SEXUALLY discriminate me based on my race and voice (the whole educated world, knows, who is called Andrea in Italy)Immensely shocked by what I was hearing ( and your company recording), I asked him to provide me immediately his name and his ID number.Aware, we could identify him, he refused.I closed the call and sent an email to Amazon. As it is always the case, the Email was ignored.This is all they answered and ignored any further request for clarificationWe're contacting you about your recent interaction with our Customer Service team. After further review, we determined that your communication with our Customer Service Associate was inappropriate and not in agreement with the Amazon.com Conditions of Use.On 29th September I opened a formal complaint in the Business Bureau. As expected, you are pretending not to know anything about the case and went into silence Radio and did not even begin the investigation that a normal company would do – see below. Hello,I'm so sorry, but we can't offer any additional insight or action on this matter.We appreciate your business and hope to see you again soon.Regards,MohammedAmazon.comAs you can see from the document below, this is not the first time, that Amazon uses this sexual harassments and discrimination towards employees, but now they are also extending to customers.As a result I am asking Amazon, to refund me of the amount I am suing you for as part of this case.Any tentative to further pretend to ignore form the clouds will be ignored, and we will bring you to Court.Doctor Ing",0

Now, I have to wait an additional two days. Pathetic shipment support.",1

"The prime fee is not worth it any longer Also, when a package is late they refer you to ups who in turn advise you to contact AmazonThey dont have ownership anymore but expect you to pay for their prime support",1
Great service. Received order on time as promised!,2
The worst site ever for trying to change info details .. change email spent two hours trying and edit fail edit fail edit fail.. I'm done with this poor service poor site.. besides the last item I ordered was delivered broke and they did nothing about it..,0
"I can't believe there are still stores around with Amazon! If I need it, Amazon usually has it with free 2 day shipping! I <3 you Amazon.",2
great range of items ,2
Bought from amazon multiple times and have loved it every single time! Revolutionised online shopping for me,2
Still waiting for A delivery which was meant to be Thursday 14th I no longer need now as this was a birthday present. I want to cancel the order for refund but can’t find any way of talking to and actual person,0
"Always attentive, responsive and (if needed) compensative. I never like to pay extra for something for fast delivery that I can have a few days later under usual circumstances but I never regret being a Prime customer and paying the annual subscription fee. Amazon for the win! :)",2

This amazon.com is so great for those who are lazy to go outside of their comfort. You can just find and select the stuff you want and add to your cart then you are good to go! Just wait your order just a few days! good job and keep it up.,2
"AMAZON is FOR BUYERS not SELLERS! they rip you off and charge you an arm and leg for selling stuff. I literally sold over $800 dollars worth of books and ended up with $350 due to the fees and I had the seller option which was 80 bucks a month if you have tons of listings. I thought it would help me, but either way they get you. Plus their are so many TROLLS that buy your new books and return the same book but used! They get away with it too! I had that happen, had proof of the fraud, and they still took the money out of my account! I am done selling with them. I would rather sell elsewhere!",1
"Some products which should have had their ingredients labeled didn't but otherwise, everything was really good.",2
Could do better. Not always the most practical option for the purchase of decents. When multi buying a compromise on post and order should be considered.,1
"Amazon has always been great for me. Great delivery, Great support. Website really easy to use",2
"Best customer service , always sort out any issues quickly",2
"You still can't beat Amazon Prime! For most items, I'll always look on Amazon first for pricing or availability. But I will say lately there's more junk brands. I don't even buy anything I ingest or put on my face/body due to horror stories about things being expired and their lackluster sorting of inventory - from who its from. But everything else, I still buy on Amazon. Stellar customer service.",2
"I have been an Amazon customer for many years and also as a Prime customer. The main reason is because of their normally excellent returns policy. I've just started a return for an item within the returns timeline only to have to jump through hoops and several arguments to get them to accept the return.Now the main reason for me to buy from Amazon has been destroyed. Someone needs to change this policy of belligerence. However it won't be me, I'm going to buy from elsewhere. The replacement for this product, is twice the price of the return, but I've placed an order with another retailer now.",0
"Amazon was able to donate billions of dollars to charity through their smile program. Their CEO, and Board members saw that, and decided to remove smile so they could keep the money instead of donating it to a good cause. Amazon just keeps getting worse, and worse.",0
Always happy with their customer service. I just wish that they have a better quality control/check on the products sold as sometimes the quality is not so good.,2
Ok but a lot of fake items and account needs to be careful,1
"delieverd item was defective . And now i am slogging to get my refund .first time my item was not picked by the delievery boy and then they given me next date. In that day item was picked but a person from station in their supply chain called me on phone and said to talk to coustomer assistances fot writing some kind of note about the issue. and now i have became a football between them, calling one person to the other and still not got my refund of 33990 rupees.finally i got my refund 14 days later i applied to return the item. Manager was saying , it is not usual and happened with me first time , so you can consider it. if you need your item urgent , don't order from here. go to the store , it's my advice",1
"Amazon's customer assistance has declined over the last years. Their 2 day shipping for prime members is great, but when there's an issue with an order their customer assistance lacks the support that they should be providing. ",1
Cheap price. So far not ordinary.,1
"Every time I shop here, I know for a fact I'm getting what I order within an exact period of time, if not earlier. I love reading reviews on their website, so I always leave mine too. More importantly, I get to choose among different booksellers, second-hand books with various usage - love, love, love it!",2
great range of items ,2
"The website of this company was made by half-brained, one-armed coders and it was approved as competent   by their corporate bosses who sustain themselves on backside juice. (unfortunately trustpilot did not allow more appropriately descriptive language)",0
"Great Service as always, get my dvds on time everytime...",2
"2024 has been one unpredictable order after another. When purchasing, you are given choices as to order dates. Purchase may be averaged between dates. However, when promised same day or next day, the on going accuracy has been off by a couple days and the tracker is slow to update until items are within minutes of house. It's hot and I'm old, so grabbing before ruined is sometimes a factor and scheduling when I'll be there to take it inside.",1
I had an overall good experience with Amazon.,2
Ordered 4 prime items. Needed today. 2 delivered but in my safe space although I was home!!! 2 apparently unsuccessful delivery as I wasn’t in. Oh yes I was. Idiot forgot them and most probably couldn’t be bothered to come back. I’m fuming as they were birthday presents. Disgusted with Amazon. Really gone downhill!!!,0
"As a whole I have had a acceptable interaction with Amazon, but that changed today when I called and Mezagreg (?) answered. I will take responsibility for halfway listening (working) to his question and answering him, but there is no excuse for chastising a customer for the way they talk. I  showed frustration for a situation that I'm dealing with and having an Amazon representative try to control me and the way I talk is crossing the line. He even laughed with amusement telling me to be professional (the customer). Then he hung up on me.  The next representative told me what he wrote explaining the call which was not the truth. I am sick of customer assistance representatives abusing the customers because they know they can hangup on us with the support of the company. How can a customer get help or ask a question if the people answering the phone has it out for us even before they answer. No care for the customer anymore.",1
"It is very difficult to end Free Trial. Instructions say ""Manage Membership"" tab is at top of the page but is impossible to find. You put End Trial in search box and it offer Books for Sale to tell you how to end an Amazon Trial. Is that stupid? Have the company gone mad? I've spent 40 minuets going round and round on Amazon site without finding how to end my trial. Please can anybody help.",0
Didnt like the usage with the seller,1
Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy,2
"I really enjoy using Amazon for online shopping but the shipment drivers do NOT make the usage worth it. They are a disappointment almost every time & I barely get my packages from them when they come to my house! They will leave my house with the package while I'm home due to them not reading the shipment instructions. Which are very simple instructuons. It's not even worth the hassel any more & thinking about cancelling my prime. They have excellent costumer assistance, but it's becoming a waste of money because of the driver's. So so sad",1
"Experience with the web site acceptable and shipment hit and miss from next day promised  to 3 days, main complaint is with their Card which is run by New Day received a call  from Newday asking personnel questions did not know them the so refused to give details.Looked on Amazon card to find was New day. Rang customer assistances on first attempt not got to a person. 2nd time spoke to a very pleasant customer assistance person  only to find out I had been charged £12 and £5 for late payment. I have not received any statement by e-mail and they don't send in post. I note this has happened to others just a way of making money.",1
"Excellent choice, great prices",2
Buy most of my online shopping from them rarely get any problems but when I do they sort it out quickly I love Amazon,2

"Avoid this sh!!ty store. I bought giftcards 2 times, both times my account got suspended ""due to suspicious activity"" and I had to call 3 times and wait over 3 days until my account got reopened. Second time I ordered EXACT same thing happened. I have dual layer security on my account and everything at hand, still my account is ""suspicious"" and your order and account gets on hold at any moment they feel like it. No customer service can help you, the ONLY way is to fill out a form through the website and SCAN multiple documents from the bank and older payments to ""ensure you are the owner of the account"" . Words can't describe the idiotic level on this store and service.",0
"You can find just about anything on Amazon.  Love the site.  Easy to use.  If any problems with an order, always easily resolved.",2
"I have shopped Amazon for years and have never been disappointed.  Most times, I can buy what I want with just one click and I have the product the next day.",2
cheap and fast; they sure are. however they cant help me in the sales process; just undercut everyone else who can,1
"I did not like the order person, he hammered on door and then tried handle, this is really ordinary.I have a lot of deliveries and I answer my door promptly I do not require  a break in support.",1
"I really don't have words to explain about Amazon. They are simply amazing when it comes to online retailing. They excel in all areas such as merchandising, customer service ,understand the customer needs and top notch service.",2
"Do yourself a favor and sign up for amazon prime. Yes, you may be screwing over brick and mortar shops, but I love being able to order soap from my phone while in bed.",2
"Amazon are cun.ts.  It is almost impossible to order something without unwittingly subscribing to Amazon pPrime.  And,  of course,  there is no legal recorse because you mistakenly clicked on a obscurely labeled button agreeing to it.  To add insult to injury to insult,  Amazon Prime comes with a hefty price tag of £9 a month.",0
I love the kindle and cant wait for the new version!!!!,2
I order all the time off Amazon. Sometimes they get my address correctly. Sometimes they don't. I'm fed up with it. It's happening most weeks now. And I've put a special instruction where my address is. Grrrrrrr 😣,1
"Please be aware that Amazon trade in service is a scam! Amazon condone their scam and won't help. I sent a complete Xbox, all accessories and in perfect condition and working order. They halved the amount promised saying that I didn't send all accessories (why would I keep them???) And that the console was damaged. They could not send me pictures of said damage nor tell me what was missing. I'm furious.",0
I like having the convenience but the prices are getting up there. The whole point was affordable stuff all in one place i thought? Then if you have an issue its almost not worth it to bother bc you get the run around from the people thinking that you are some scammer trying to get your money back and keep a item. Dont appreciate the attitude.,1
"I love Amazon. The speed on their service is always quick and they have improved maiden in their customer support over the years.Recently had a slight issue and had email, live chat, phone sorry to choose from. Sure some things go wrong from time to time but they sort everything out quickly.",2
"the worst company I never want to work for these types of people from Amazon again, after working for them you will notice that you are treated like a slave they have the worst, incompetent and arrogant staff all the id..ts at amazon are bosses they came for a year at amazon, maybe  don't even speak English very well and they have come to believe that they are superior and important, some messes",0

So sick of reps that cannot understand English!!",0
Disclaimer: this review was initially posted to the UK site however I just noticed that the profile is unclaimed.I see all the negativity around Amazon however I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with them so far. Got a full refund on a 2yo earbuds which I’m pretty confident that no other shop would honour. Amazon still remains my favourite online shopping option.,2
"Horrible experience, sent defective, open box, used junk. Slow to refund, horrible customer service all the way around.",0
Went to check the tracking of a parcel and found I had to pay £1.50 to download app to check where my parcel is. This is ridiculous!!!,1
I have absolutely loved Amazon in the past but the last couple of months they have really disappointed me. I’m a Prime subscriber and have normally received my purchases in several days. Perfect! But lately it has been taking weeks….to not at all! Has anyone else been experiencing this. I’m truly bummed and disappointed as all get out!,1
"What I like about Amazon is the ability to order an item and receive it either the next day or the same day if available. I prefer to keep what I order, but at times, they don't fit or are described inaccurately, and appreciate the ability to return or replace them; however, lately, I've noticed a tactic that I hope is just the left hand not knowing what the right is doing and not a more grim plan to deceive their customers. I purchased an item for close to $300 and realized it did not work for what I needed it to. I printed out the return label and returned it to Kohl's. My funds were refunded and I purchased a unit that was close to $500 that served my purpose. Shortly thereafter, I started receiving emails from Amazon saying I needed to return the item and that they already refunded my money. They also stated that my card would be charged the full amount if not returned by a certain day. I may be incorrect, but Amazon has never refunded me for an item that was not returned. I was able to chat with an Amazon representative, they researched and found that the merchandise was returned and I was good to go. A month later, yesterday, my Prime card was charged the full amount for the item I charged. I'm disputing the charges and waiting to see how Amazon responds to my dispute, that will decide my business further with them.",0
I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day order and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1
"Amazon’s system and delivery guys all corrupt! I had issues back to back with losing my parcels and Amazon give a zero f…k  to help ! Delivery guys dumping the parcels random places , no notification for arriving time ! Nor delivered , Amazon wanted me to call police to report and take a crime number , local police station refused to give crime number because they said if there’s no pic no notification about delivery then there’s no crime obviously Amazon giving terrible service after grabbing your money !! Amazon should give a decent service before saying it’s a crime and need police report! Amazon shouldn’t get away with this organised scam I will complain to other legal bodies and definitely I will shop from EBay from now !!! instead of crook Amazon!",0
"We have been loyal customers for decades - spending well over $150,000 in the past with Amazon.Recently, without warning or explanation, we were banned from Reviewing and asking Product Questions.   We inquired with the Amazon Moderation Review team and got no explanation.   All the reviews we had left for products we had purchased were removed - ALL of them.   Many years worth of reviews with photos.   These reviews had *thousands* of helpful votes.We are closing all accounts including Amazon credit card accounts.  We are closing our Amazon accounts.   We are no longer shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods.This company is too big to care - we need to support other, smaller retailers before this evil company takes over the entire world.",0
Amazon is getting more and more expensive I'm starting to find stuff locally and almost half price used to order a lot from Amazon but lately local has been cheaper,1
"Meh, it really wasn’t great, items came but it was missing pieces, I use it a lot and 1/2 the stuff is always wrong, only acceptable thing is the order time",1
Amazon is pretty decent.It's useful for cheeper price and decent quality items.,1
Virtos UK (Digital Red Square) awful fraudulent company with Amazon not much better.sold me a refurbished Samsung Note 20 ultra with a defective screen with a 1yr refurbished warranty offered by Amazon.sent phone back for a full refund and only part refunded.contacted Amazon customer services 4 times but as we know another money launderering company takes your money and offers nothing in return for customer support.my advice...stay well clear of Amazon and Virtos UK (Digital Red Square).,0
So far my experience is fine with them. Because their customer service is perfect.,2
"Terrible service, driver marked status as delivered without delivering it. Spent half n hour looking for it. I wont talk about their customer services. The other week they sent half of my food order. Was nice buying from you un the past but i wont be giving amazon any of my hard earned or time",0
Prime subscription is nothing but west of money! Delays in the delivery always!! I don't recommend it at all.,0
"I ordered an IPad Air from Amazon (the company itself rather than a Marketplace seller) on 24th November. It was meant to be my daughter’s Christmas present and it cost several hundred pounds. It should have been delivered to me on 26th November, though instead I was delivered a box of opened dry cat food. I presume that an Amazon employee somewhere along the chain took the IPad and replaced it with the cat food that they emptied to an equivalent weight.I phoned Amazon Customer Services on 26th November and explained what had happened. I asked I be sent an actual IPad Air, though was told I could only be refunded the money, and only once Amazon had “received my return” (the cat food). UPS collected the cat food from me on 27th and delivered it to Amazon on 28th November.Two and a half weeks and several phone calls to Amazon down the line I was told today that “hopefully” I should be refunded my money on 3rd January 2024 (38 days after I’d initially explained to Amazon what had happened and “returned” the item).Each Amazon Customer Services person over the past couple of weeks has treated me indifferently, as if I’m a customer who has returned an unwanted book rather than someone who has essentially been defrauded by an Amazon employee. In actual fact I’ve been treated worse than someone returning an unwanted book, as if it had been a low cost item that was being refunded I would have been reimbursed within 14 days, rather than it taking more than a month because of the financial cost involved. I have kept on being told to “be patient” and that I’ll be refunded in 5 to 10 days, though the date keeps being put back for no reason that anyone has explained, and now for some reason I won’t be refunded until 2024. It means my daughter will be without a Christmas present this year. No one at Amazon seems particularly bothered or sympathetic.I might continue to buy inexpensive items from Amazon that I can’t easily get elsewhere, though I certainly won’t be buying anything expensive from them again. Though buying from Amazon is often convenient, it is much safer to shop with a retailer with decent, accessible and relatively transparent Customer Services.",0
Thank you for,1
"I have had an Amazon account for YEARS!!  It sure would be nice and beneficial to know exactly which review(s) are supposed to be so ""unusual"", and that are supposed to be the problem!  I haven't even written any reviews for a month, probably more. I can't even remember the last time I wrote a review or for which products.  ALL REVIEWS have to go through an approval process by Amazon BEFORE they are even posted ""live"" on Amazon, so why weren't any of these ""suspicious"" &/or ""unusual"" reviews ""red flagged"" and ""kicked back"" during this initial approval process? To me, this entire supposedly suspicious and unusual review blocking of my account seems very suspicious to me. After YEARS of buying and leaving reviews, with ZERO problems on Amazon.......then BOOM, suddenly, I'm just blocked, no explanation, Amazon doesn't even bother to notify me about any of this. I have left a few UNBIASED reviews for a free or discounted product offer, that a seller has included an offer/promotional card or label on their product to do so for the product I ordered from them. HOWEVER, I have ALWAYS disclosed this information in my review (just as have a LOT of other buyers have done on product reviews they have left) and ALL of my reviews, no matter what I was offered or not offered have ALWAYS been true and unbiased! I, myself rely on HONEST, ACCURATE and UNBIASED reviews from other customers for products they have purchased on & off Amazon. I would NEVER leave a false, untrue, biased, or inaccurate review, never! There are already too many false, fake, and biased reviews out there for products &/or scammer sellers on and off Amazon!  That is another reason why I disclose in any review I write, if a seller has ""solicited"" me to write a review (because I feel this is somewhat unethical) AND in fact, I will leave a  more critical review for that product. I have several of these offerings right now, that I have NOT reviewed. If this is NOT allowed on Amazon, then why doesn't Amazon penalize and BLOCK the SELLER and their ACCOUNT from being able to sell their product on Amazon? Why is the buyer/customer being penalized? I have seen so much of this in other customer reviews for YEARS (obviously it wasn't/isn't a problem because all those reviews are visible and have not been removed or blocked by Amazon)! It seems like 80% of everything I have purchased in the past year has come with some sort of solicitation included......this is a SELLER problem and NOT a buyer problem!  BUYERS have ZERO control on what a SELLER includes with their product when it's shipped out to them! So again, why would Amazon be blocking the BUYERS?One more thing I just found out and would like to bring to everyone's attention! I just looked and every single product that I received a solicitation card with the product or solicitation directly on the product itself, and that I still have the solicitation info for was FULFILLED and SHIPPED directly from/by AMAZON! If this is against Amazon policy it would then seem that AMAZON needs to get their own ""house"" in order and stop penalizing their paying customers for solicitation material that their very own Amazon employees are putting in the product packages before shipping them! I have canceled my Prime account and other Amazon subscriptions and will not place any further orders through Amazon. As I am sure Amazon doesn't want to have any further business relationship, with an all of a  sudden, ""suspicious"" and ""unusual"" buyer.",0
"This review is about the shipment drivers, I must say I’ve absolutely no issues with Amazon itself, the items or communication.Why do the shipment drivers advise ‘ parcel handed to customer’ when they literally play knock door run?……we’ve had 2 lots of parcels delivered both stating that it was handed to customer, one of which our camera picked up an opportunist thief, who came onto the drive and helped himself ( I now have to wait until 17/12/22 for a replacement, Amazon didn’t question and delt with it the best they could, but why should the seller loose out ?…by having to replace it ? …)… yesterday another 2 parcels were just left on the doorstep in full view of passers by, again the same comment that it was handed to the customer….. please sort the shipment drivers out, get them to take an image of the handover or they should be the ones to loose out.",1
"Always a pleasure to do business with. Updates by email, goods delivered when said. Very trustworthy company and easy to return good if necessary.",2
"Overall, my interaction with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same goods, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer assistance...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their goodss better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.",1
"Shopping on Amazon has been a mixed bag. The prices are generally good, but the quality of products can be hit or miss. Delivery times are average, and customer service is responsive but sometimes slow. Not bad, but not perfect either.",2
"Ordered an item that cost $317 compared to the MSRP of $449. Received the order quickly, but because somebody at the warehouse put the correct stock label on the wrong product I was sent an item that was completely wrong and with a price point $165 less than what I ordered. Customer service has been an absolute nightmare trying to get the return set up. First I had to e-mail photos of the packaging and everything else to which their reply was that it was invalid and I had to re-submit the exact same thing all over again. Finally got the approval for a return. Second they tell me they can't replace the incorrect item with the correct one and that I would have to get a refund and try ordering again. Then they couldn't send me the correct e-mail with the correct return shipping labels for me to print to apply to the return box. It took 8 different emails to finally get the right link to print the proper labels. Sent the item back by USPS with a tracking number on 6/27 and it was delivered on 6/29. The return center took 4 days until 7/3 to finally acknowledge it as received and it would take 2-3 days to process the refund and another 2-3 for the refund to appear back on my card.It's now been nearly two weeks and I still haven't gotten my refund. Call to find out what is going on and I'm told that I can't get refunded until I send back the correct item. Because of their moronic mistake of putting the correct stock label on the incorrect item their system shows that I received the correct item. It was shown with photographic proof in the initial return photos that the label with the correct item name/number was literally 3 inches away from the incorrect name/number on the product box it was placed on, but they're too incompetent to get that through their heads. I can't return what I never received. Now it's just one big runaround to get these scumbags to give me my money back. These incompetent morons will never get another dime from me after this ridiculous hassle over a simple return of their stupid mistake.",0
"Overall amazon is a very solid company and selling online market. It’s not flawless and the are clear and obvious flaws. However take away those flaws and you get a very solid and reasonable company. Lots of availability. Great items but sometimes lets me down with the order. But overall it’s very acceptable and trustworthy. If the a issue it’s always handled with professionalism and acceptable integrity. Which I like. It’s a great company with great resources that provide fast, efficient online shopping usage.",1
"Avoid amazon at all costs. You will always find items cheaper elsewhere.The delivery service has changed and takes a lot longer, yet they've increased the monthly charge, they are more concerned about taking contracts elsewhere than actually providing a service for its customers. So while it's customers pay more per month, amazon takes advantage of other companies like royal mail and fills in contracts over its own customers while you continue to lay a monthly charge. The website is full of fake and dangerous items.Amazon likes to show chinese made items. Filtering the high quality Western products over the Chinese.So you buy the crap and then return to buy again.Constantly returning items that don't workCustomer service attempting to enforce amazon's policies on me haha. No amazon, the public do not follow amazon's policies. The customer support are from South Africa and don't understand british consumer rights. And they attempt to enforce rules on you. Sorry this is the UK not Africa.",0
"I've always had a great experience ordering from Amazon, the two day shipping is perfect!",2
"No proper complaints procedure. The customer is not valued, and customer service is non-existent. Items go missing, returns are problematic, refunds are promised, but never delivered. The couriers damage the parcels without care. The products are often cheaper elsewhere. I don't know what I was thinking of when signing up to their free trial because the missing items were far from free. It was a learning experience and the lesson learned was don't use Amazon.",0
"Amazon is a platform with a acceptable variety of goodss, but the problem is the price",1
"It used to be that if I purchase more than $35, it usually was Free Shipping.  Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1
I received my order very quickly and accurately. I will absolutely use Amazon again.,2
"I ordered a Ninja air fryer on the 14/12. Today I was told Hermes had delivered it at 3.44 pm today. First they said it had been handed to the customer and then changed it to ‘left in a safe place’. Neither of which was true. Amazon have said they will send a full refund. Fine, but this was a surprise Christmas gift for my daughter. Shame on you Hermes and Amazon. Very disappointed.",0
Best trusted online shopping platform. Yes there are many irresponsible sellers but customer service does its best to help,2
I am so happy that I broke up with Amazon.I use to use them for almost everything. I have found that if I go directly to the companies I wish to order from that I am actually saving money! Not a lot but a few$$. But this all adds up and the idea that you are saving on Amazon is not true in most cases. Start supporting the people that make the products you like. There is no reason for Amazon to be the middleman.,0
Right on for Amazon,2
Accidentally got amazon prime. Was forced to verify payment account before ending my subscription. Glad Amazon gets sued for misleading customers into prime.,0

"I used to rely on Amazon so much to deliver so fast to me, not I have to order more days ahead, they need to fix their shipment supports.",1
"I attempted to purchase something from Amazon and use a virtual Visa card which I was told BY THEM is basically like a credit card and I'd be able to use it! Then things took a ridiculous turn in that the card wouldn't work and in contacting their customer services team I got zero help. It's actually hilarious that in the end they sent me a total of 11 replies without managing to answer my actual query at all. I requested to make a complaint and continued to get conflicting information and random agents trying to tell me they were in charge yet continued to send me conflicting and useless information! I went and spent my money elsewhere in the end ...what a joke! I also ended up cancelling my Amazon unlimited account as there's nothing like shocking customer service to make you not want to give someone your money anymore - they were so unhelpful didn't seem like they wanted it.I have to admit this is the first time I've had an issue with Amazon ...I've been shopping with them for around 13 years, but this episode was pretty catastrophic and went on for about 2 weeks! I never did really get the response I was waiting for and that's why I gave up! I now prefer to use other online stores and eBay although I think Amazon is great for range of products, not interested in being treated like I don't matter as a customer again!",0
"As a whole I have had a decent interaction with Amazon, but that changed today when I called and Mezagreg (?) answered. I will take responsibility for halfway listening (working) to his question and answering him, but there is no excuse for chastising a customer for the way they talk. I  showed frustration for a situation that I'm dealing with and having an Amazon representative try to control me and the way I talk is crossing the line. He even laughed with amusement telling me to be professional (the customer). Then he hung up on me.  The next representative told me what he wrote explaining the call which was not the truth. I am sick of customer support representatives abusing the customers because they know they can hangup on us with the support of the company. How can a customer get help or ask a question if the people answering the phone has it out for us even before they answer. No care for the customer anymore.",1
"Trying to walk 4 miniature dogs down our drive , the Amazon driver was very close behind and pressing me to move faster.One dog panicked and froze. I told the driver he was an idiot not giving me time. I am 73. He asked was I from the address he was delivering to, then said Im not delivering. After explaining this to customer service, they said they require me to sign a form to say their drivers will be safe !!!!! So its never Amazons fault then ?",0
Amazon is the only place I will go to on line to search for and buy products. They have every item you could think of for sale. I have bought a good few items from them and have never ever had a problem.,2
"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of usages with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only acceptable thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1

Delivery driver said left items behind wheelie bin not true it was round back of building just dumped half out of storage box loads of room in storage box for doors to shut .It was heavy rain so cardboard box item in fell apart.

"After almost 20 years of custom I finally kicked Amazon UK into touch. I have spent thousands of pounds with them but over time have gotten more more fed up with missed promised deliveries, outrageous delays in returns and refunds, bad customer service and their determination to ignore UK consumer law.I am now spending my hard earned cash elsewhere and actually enjoying it and I would recommend that you do to.",0
"Amazon used to provide a great service however now they do not back up their customers. A seller was dishonest and a shipment they claimed was shipped and billed to me never actually shipped when really looking at tracking, package never arrived, seller did not care and would not refund, and Amazon did nothing- just allows the seller to operate this way taking advantage of customers with false advertising of products and dishonest business practices.",0
I think that Amazon has excellent customer service!  ty!!,2
"Amazon Prime is away ahead of the game as a media and commodity provider and in the latter very fine at sourcing unusual or hard to come by items that you may need from time to time! And their customer assistance on Prime items is second to none. However, here’s the but - don’t trust Amazon reviews for their associated/affiliated sellers as they are largely hogwash - this view is attested by several leading consumer related bodies. If buying an item via Amazon from one of these guys make sure you double check independent reviews on them. And don’t bother posting critical reviews on these sellers as Amazon will usually block them.",1
Reliable for me when I order next day xxx,2
Never ever really had issues with Amazon.Always deliver the correct items in excellent condition and always on time,2
"I placed three separate orders in one day with Amazon Marketplace. Unbeknownst to me, Amazon lumped them together as one banking transaction. I got a dispatch on one item before email stating 'payment declined""-card was perfectly fine nowhere near its limit. Contacted Customer Services-no other way to contact them available, had to be the help hub. Must have explained my problem to 3 assistants and manager. Requested cancellation, no one it appeared in the whole of Amazon, -though plenty have boasted over the days to me they could-, could cancel order.Asked me to confirm my details which did and everything back on for delivery. Amazon took the money from my bank account. Two further items dispatched. Another 'payment declined' email. Contacted Customer Services more repeating over and over again my issue - though it's all supposed to be on their screens to read through past conversations- could find a way to help properly. At one point I was told by a manager I would be refunded for one item, even got a confirmation email from him, two weeks later no refund received.Now advised not to confirm my card and let order auto cancel. In meantime received two further items. Order then cancelled itself still not getting four of my items, worth nearly £40. Told in the hours and hours I have had to spend on chat, that my money would be refunded, nothing. In one of my conversations I had asked for an A-Z marketplace  refund request. Operative requested incorrectly on one of the items I did receive. Got an email back from seller telling me they would not be sending the item as I had not paid!?! I am now having to go to my bank and request refund of whole payment and waiting 60 days for Amazon's cock up. The customer service team haven't got a clue what they are doing, just knew how to tell me to stop using bad language after stating I thought Amazon was a 'greedy' company. AMAZON YOU ARE A GREEDY FARCE!",0
"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank fineness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your assistance we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
Worst customer ever as they could not deal with an item I bought and never received and had to cancel my subscription. Will stick to eBay as the customer service is excellent in terms of this situation. With all these bad feedback I’m seeing on here I’m surprised nothing has been done about it obviously they don’t really care.,0
"Amazing, have been buying for a while now. Great prices compared to others. Next day delivery is a game changer. Customer service are second to none if you ever encounter any problems. Prime subscription for the extra benefits is well recommended. Top marks guys.",2
I am not getting OTPs sent to my phone in South Africa which has worked for decades  it suddenly stopped working yesterday. Now that phone number has been blocked. I’ve spent 3 hours on chat and phone calls with Amazon Cistomer Support where I repeated the simple problem over and over and over again and no one could help. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. No exaggeration. So we set up a new account with my wife’s details which was fine. When we tried to enter hýe ozone number once again no OTP arrived at her phone. They keep on insisting we are making the error and yet it is their system. I e been using Amazon and the OTP for many years and it suddenly stops working but not one of the 12 customer service agents could help,0

"I love the convenience of ordering online, however the order system for this company fails in many ways by having ""lazy"" order individuals deliver the goodss. I have had goodss wet, muddy, run over, and simply lost in a place not visible to retrieve them. This is an ongoing problem with Amazon. They need their own trucks and driver to eliminate this problem.",1
Amazon has stopped 2 day shipment in my area. Ridiculous why even get prime at this point?,1
I just used Amazon and ordered an item with a great review and the item arrived and works as well as the reviews state so I wished to also leave a review for the item but according to Amazon guidelines I need to spend $50 or more a month to be eligible to review... so Amazon is getting an Average score from me for not allowing me to review a item.  Terrible policy if you ask me.,1

Customer support was unable to make a trade in for the newest Kendal fire. I bought in July of 2018.  They offered me 20.00 dollars for a just out of warranty item.

"Used to absolutely love Amazon prime due to quick and cheaper deliveries and to be able to watch shows and films however lately Amazon prime has started doing advertising on the movies/shows at the beginning and during so I no longer think it’s great  , still fine for deliveries but Amazon prime TV is not worth it, you have to pay or subscribe for most of it now and on anything else you now need to watch adverts got a feeling there will be a lot of people like me that will end up cancelling their membership",1
"Awful - Nb this is about Amazon export sales LLC: ordered from them, package arrived safely in UK. Delivery screwed up by useless UK courier, Hermes. Hermes say you can contact the seller directly who will raise delivery issues with them. Just try contacting Amazon, a pathetic joke. You get a stupid chat algorithm that repeats the same thing - do you want the contact details for the (US leg) courier company, who - you guessed it - on their website say 'you should raise delivery queries with the seller'. Amazon are happy to take your money, flaming useless when anything goes wrong.",0
Been a bit delay recently but guess just near the Christmas.,1
"Been using Amazon on and off for a few years now, never had any issues that is until this last order I made. I placed the order and 12 hours later get a response in my email saying my order was cancelled due to insufficient funds thing is funds were not insufficient and the order came in anyways. Normally if something is insufficient it tells me rite away not 12 hours later in a email. Amazon need's to update their order processing and payment sytem. The reason I give three stars is because it's the only issue I've had with Amazon and if this continues to be the same usage I will be giving the lowest rating but as for a second chance I'm sticking to three stars.",1

This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0

"Orders always come on time and most have no issues. When I did have one last year, the rep was so nice about it, gave me a refund on the spot! He completely understood where I was coming from, unlike Newegg who takes a good 2 weeks to process a refund, needs an investigations team for the whole thing ,etc. Not to mention the prime with a free 30 day trial! And yes I mean free, no having to buy an annual membership and then you get the trial after that. ( you know who im talking about)",2
normally on time and always cheap,2
"1) Amazon should have a shipping options. They have only 2 options, 1 which is 24 hours or less and is very expensive, 2 the normal shipping is 2-3 days and can be expensive for some ,like myself who would be willing to wait 7-18 days and pay much less for shipping.     I just made an order 22 days ago and the order was supposed to arrive Dec.23 in time for Xmas,in paying they asked if the UPS can bring my order on Saturday or Sunday, with a click option for each.I clicked ""not on Saturday"", they delivered it on SATURDAY when no one was home and the whole order package was returned to Amazon.22 days later I had to contact customer  support which were very nice in offering to give me back the same amount of money I paid them 22 days before, I am sure they do this and make many $$$millions simply on $Money free interest which they invest in Amazon free loans from we buyers.(I still have not yet received my refund)",1

I can no longer support a website that doesn't value freedom, and quite literally inserts itself to make a political statement against a difference of opinion. I cancelled my Prime, and will shop else where. I'm not American but if this is allowed to stand it means more censorship going forward that you have no right to control. You are a online seller not a political party, or a party who gets to dictate free speech. I hope it was worth losing customers over.",0

I am very up set with Amazon right now a few weeks ago I ordered a few things total was around like $85 it says it was delivered now I have delivery instructions which they didn't follow left somewhere else the door they left at is always open with a store in front so people park in front of it all the time. When I got home I checked and NO PACKAGE I called customer service and they told me they have to investigate well they said that once package is delivered it's not their responsibility so no refund I was so upset and still am. Today I was suppose to receive my package and I hade to revise payment and because there system didn't update it I am now going to get my package tomorrow and I needed it for a client today I asked to be compensated with something seeings I have to cancel the appointment and loose out on money if I could leave the a zero I would this is not right,0

I cannot tell you how many people I know of, myself included, have gotten ripped off from this major company!! Especially with beauty products, name brand products, even CLOTHING!! I mean, Amazon's ""3rd party merchants"" are just a friggen way for Amazon to get around getting sued for selling faulty crap! It's a cop out so they don't have to claim responsibility when their customers get ripped off!! It's so they can say, ""oh it wasn't us, how would we have known that vendor was sending you a fake product that burned your skin,,!!"" They KNOW alot of their ""3rd party jerk so-called sellers"" are ripping their millions of customers off BUT THEY DON'T GIVE A CRAP AND AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE IT UNLESS THEY STOP MAKING MONEY FROM US,  THE CONSUMER!! THEY NEED TO START SELLING THEIR OWN **AUTHENTIC** INVENTORY THAT THEY CAN PERFORM QUALITY CONTROL ON!!! I just can't believe how many people have gotten ripped off, yet mad amounts of hard working Americans are still throwing their money away to them!

Worst Service Ever had.Please don't use amazon service anymore,0

Amazon's solution to ANY problem? We ""will,"" (they wont) call you back tomorrow. This can go on for weeks depending if you get someone on the phone who cares about their 10 cent a hour job ( outsourced callcenter)  Then if you finally get your order , IT WONT EVEN BE YOUR ORDER, And guess what return process takes atleast 2 weeks.And I am not even speaking of the endless documentation requested to prove account ownership when you buy something expensive. As of this day amazon is still holding over a 1000 euro hostage in refund and will call me any day now ( yeah no) Tldr (to long didn't read)You are safer replying to Nigerian scam mails than by shopping with Amazon.",0

"BOYCOTT AMAZONI have used Amazon for twenty years or more, and buy hundreds of items from them every year. Last week I had an insolent message from a so-called Account Specialist who claimed: ""We noticed that you have requested multiple returns in the last few months, and some of the items that you have returned were damaged, used, or not in their original condition."" That was a pack of lies. I wrote back, pointing out that I have never returned anything unless there was something wrong with it, and that nothing had ever been damaged or been used. This waste-of-space (who has never signed his name) then copied his first message without answering my email. I then complained first to the Manager, then to HIS boss, and I sent copies to Jeff Bezos which always did the trick. The waste-of-space pulled the same stunt four times - never replied, and simply copied his first message again and again. I have now demanded that my complaint be escalated and until it is resolved, I will not buy anything through these misfits.",0
Good company! Always has delivered to us.,2
"I absolutely love Amazon. They've been a very reliable hub to shop from, with absolutely no problems in anything I've purchased on their site (from the company itself nor the independent merchants).  I've bought books, computer hardware, games, music, jewelery, guitar accessories, and clothes from Amazon, and everything has been top notch service. Delivery estimates either exactly when they say, or my items arrived earlier than expected, and well packaged.",2
amazon is a decent platform for B2b bussines.,1
"I purchased 14 items yesterday for Christmas for my children. The order was split into three shipping orders. One of my order came back “payment declined”, I checked my bank and there were charges on my account for those items. I emailed customer service and was advised that these charges were authorization charges and it was going to be refunded to me and therefore I should revise my payment. Furthermore they said it was a banking issue.I contacted my bank and was told there was no authorization charges or pending charges or refunds in process, that this was a legitimate charges from Amazon.I emailed customer service again. Again I get the same response as the first rep. but this time they tell me one of my items in my order was successfully charged and on its way to advance shipping. Ok, no problem, I see that charge, valid. There were two other items in this order. One item was charged before the item that was sent to shipping. Five transactions before. I explained to the rep. and still received the same answer, that it was my bank. The rep. stated in their email that if I had further questions or anything to send to reply directly to this email. I had screenshots of my banking to show the charges. So I emailed, “Mail Delivery Subsystem: Address not found.”Email number three. I’m irritated at this time. To no avail, I get the same robotic response email back as the first two.So I go into my account to try to cancel the order, this way I know for sure I’ll get my money back. “Error cannot cancel order.”24 hrs later I’m calling into customer service this time. I get a very nice polite gentleman who seemed very eager to help. 20 mins later after a few minutes of silence, “Hello? Are you still working on my account?”, ‘click’, phone disconnects.Second call into customer service. Not a very happy shopper now. Explained the situation for a fifth time now. Lady seem genuinely concerned. After some time, “Have you called your bank?” “Yes, I have.” “Ok. So there’s nothing we can do because this is a banking issue. We can cancel your order and you can reorder again.” “Ok but I’m going to lose the Black Friday prices, is there anything you can do to help offset it?” “No, your order was a declined payment therefore it’s not Amazon’s fault so there’s nothing to credit.” “Btw one of the items is now out of stock.” What?!!! In short I’m out two gifts for my kids and also out the money Amazon took from my bank. The five representatives were of no help! There was no compassion.",0
i always check Amazon first for anything that I am looking for and they usually have a free postage option as well which is always a big plus.,2
"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer support used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer support but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",1
Some of the items were fake.,1
"Amazon customer service has gone downhill for years... the latest thing these  ""customer service"" representatives are doing is tell you ""we can't help you so we're gonna terminate the call"" and then hang up. How is this customer service at all?",0
"Amazon joining big Tec Twitter, face book and google  Yesterday attacked our right to free speech.This is America please Re think tearing down a business like Parler cause you do not like what they say .I though you were diverse and invited everyone even if their opinions were different than yours.What you did yesterday was un american and not a good light for a business like yours  very disappointed in you ..bullying is not acceptable at any level !!!!! Icalled your company and there is no one to speak with also am a very good customer.",0

"Their delivery is terrible. You pay for Prime. You pay extra money for same day delivery. Wait up till 10:00 pm because they say it will deliver by then and then nothing. You track the package and it was 15 minutes away for 8 hours! You call customer service and they don’t care. Just another company that is about profits, not people. This happens all to often now. Amazon used to be good. Now it’s like a high end Wish.",0
"Pathetic customer service, very unreliable, unprofessional, app and website does not seem to be working for little things like updating the address and mobile number. I tried to log in via webpage while my app was connected- entered email address, then password then it was asking to send the code to mobile which was old and could not update via app and also somehow it was asking the credit card csv as security. I tried couple of times and then via app started using the option of chatting. One indian women picked up my chat, after understanding my message, said I am gonna transfer the request for better help, nobody got connected, i had to end the chat and start the new chat again again there was another indian guy who asked me questions and took my number plus asked where i am from and made me connected to someone who only looks after Canada and US. So they have been wating my time making me going in circles. How long does it take to simply update the number if it is not getting done via app for may be some technical reasons. Pathetic.  It's too big company that they dont even care how customers are getting treated.",0
worst customer service of my life....cant get into my account for over 6 months and they continue to charge me for Audible. still paying....cant cancel. no support. fuming,0
"Plenty of choice, helpful interface, all good stuff, easy returns should there be a problem. Very professional and trustworthy",2
"It is good, but not perfect. Now the prime day deals are amazing but sometimes the one-day delivery turns into two days. I haven't experienced more than two days thank god. It would have been perfect if they sold tech kits for cheap too and its a guaranteed one day delivery.",2
I just used Amazon and ordered an item with a great review and the item arrived and works as well as the reviews state so I wished to also leave a review for the item but according to Amazon guidelines I need to spend $50 or more a month to be eligible to review... so Amazon is getting an Average score from me for not allowing me to review a item.  Terrible policy if you ask me.,1
Awesome👏 ecommerce Platform for all types of products.,2
"Still OK, but I signed on because it was much better with very little out-sourcing and  own shipping NOT USPS!!! If one has rural order the support is not always acceptable. If you have to deal with the out sourced providers it can be a disaster...Communiation with the providers is sometimes very difficult.....",1
"Hello, I buy books on a regular basis from Amazon and am impressed with their service.  If I do have a complaint,  it is that the items seem to arrive before the informed date from Amazon.  Amazon also keep you well advised of any problems/delays with you order.",2
delivery guy was really friendly and parcel was delivered 2 days early! I would really recommend amazon. :],2
Amazon advertise goods not in stock misleading customer . After I placed my order and money went out my account they emailed me saying that my order is cancelled how bad this,0
"Amazon is a very helpful site to find alot of thing that you would want or need, but some sources that sell items on amazon are not trustworthy. I ordered something over a month ago and it didn't arrive, so I asked for a refund, i received half of what I paid for. Unless the goodss come from amazon itself, other sources might not be trustworthy.",1
Overall amazon have been pretty fine but I have been ripped off by a company I ordered buttons from. They are very late everyday they send an email once I’ve demanded a refund. Everyday it says they are arriving if not. One back tomorrow for a refund. I’ve tried emailing amazon and complaining as obviously I cannot live chat  to anyone . But you can’t even do that it sends you to an entirely different screen so  sadly amazon you are as average as the ripOff company you have allowed to trade via you,1
"The Customer Service and The Head of the Escalation Team are very deceptive, they will dodge and avoid, give you false information, I have spoken to over 30 different agents, and I was given then run-around, I would be told they will phone me...never do.....they will put a report in....over 10 reports should've been issued, but according to Head Office, not a single report was issued, this is a company that is only interested in protecting each other and nothing to do with helping put the customer, I have informed Trading Standards and a report is being built up, the fact that not a single person was able to do what they offered, or gave information that was in no way accurate, WATCH OUT JEFF  YOUR STAFF ARE LIARS, CHEATS AND SCUM",0
"Over the years I have spent thousands of pounds at Amazon. Puchasing from distance sellers is often a leap of faith - but not with Amazon. Should I be looking for high-value items I need to know that the supplier can be trusted to honour their commitments and service promises. Never once have I had a single bad experience or cause for complaint, and for this reason alone I am happy to forego reasonable price fluctuations with occasionally lower prices elsewhere as I know that I'll not be left high-and-dry with a problem. Basically, Amazon have got it right and afford their customers with the consideration and respect that is reflected in their deeds and service policy. For this reason, Amazon will get my preferential loyal custom for as long as their exemplary service continues.",2
"Still the best. Reliable and consistent. Communication is clear and to the point.  Increasingly my shopping defaults to amazon, during lock down there were my 'go to' for everything. Bezos you are worth all that money",2
"I live in a small town in Washington state, this morning I order some items  off of Amazon, and tonight they arrived. This is so impressive to me. I was able to sit in the comfort of my own home, make a purchased and have it delivered the very same day. Everyone at Amazon is a hero to me, they operate seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Thank you to all of the employees world wide to make those of us at home lives better. Amazon is not a perfect company, but we don’t live in a perfect world. They are doing a great job! Their drivers are friendly and professional. I hope Amazon realizes how great their employees are and what a value they are to their company. They are the face of the company. Store fronts, drivers, pilots…they are making Amazon great! Be kind and appreciate this home delivery service!",2
Like the idea of one day order with prime. Needs to be more goodss with prime and postage n packaging costs need to be removed as these are quite high for some goodss making ordering online pointless and a waste of money,1
Just need to call this out. My recent experience of using other home shopping services has been awful (late delivery’s and poor customer services) but everything I seem to order from Amazon (via Prime) has been spot on. Feel I have complained about other companies but should also recognise excellence.  Well done Amazon home shopping.,2
Great company does not care much about sellers,1
"Amazon works well if things are standard.  However, the moment an issue becomes non-standard, you enter customer support hell.  I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.",1
Amazon keeps going up on prime membership and there shipping has got super slow. I only order prime items so i get them next day. For the last 6 months it takes any where from 2 days to 3 months.

"While somethings are acceptable on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their shipment drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything average they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1

"As a longtime customer of Amazon.com, I have mixed feelings about my recent interactions with the company. While I can't deny the consistently acceptable quality of their goodss and supports, I can't overlook the growing trend of additional charges for certain features. It has left me feeling moderately satisfied with my overall interaction.One aspect that has always stood out for me is the impressive range of goodss available on Amazon. Whether I'm looking for electronics, home acceptables, or even niche items, I can usually find what I need. The quality of the goodss I've purchased has generally been reliable, and I appreciate the convenience of having everything delivered right to my doorstep.However, my contentment has been somewhat dampened by the increasing number of features that come at an extra cost. Previously, I enjoyed the simplicity of a Prime membership, which included fast shipping and access to a decent selection of movies, TV shows, and books. Unfortunately, it seems like more and more perks are being pulled behind additional paywalls, which can be frustrating.For instance, the introduction of Amazon Prime Video Channels, which require separate subscriptions for certain content providers, has made the streaming interaction less appealing.

"Fed up with poor customer service. No recourse for late arrivals and making me jump through hoops to prove orders were late when all information is in their system. The past 4/6 orders have been late and 1 of those never arrived. On one occasion have they offered me a FIVE DOLLAR CREDIT that can only be used on Amazon sold items which are basically non-existent for anything useful to me or relative to my shopping habits. The membership prices have increased only to offer worse customer service and worse shipping times. In this day and age it is almost just as easy and price efficient to shop on eBay. It won't be too much longer until that is fully accurate statement. I am done with the inconveniences and greedy tactics of Amazon which I used to admire as a company. I am fed up, and done. Please do not enable Amazon to rip us customers off and spend your money elsewhere.*I called about my most recent order being late I'm, to follow up about the previous recent orders, and cancel my membership. I spoke with supervisor ""Carla"", after being escalated from a first level rep due to no recourse, and we conveniently got ""disconnected"". During the call they stated they couldn't even cancel my membership. They would provide a link to which I could service the cancellation myself. How lazy? I guess I'm expected to reconsider while taking the time to jump through hoops to cancel. Afterward I receive a message that states she has applied a $40 credit to my account that I can only use on Amazon items, but without a proper conversation and acceptance from the customer. $40 credit for $1000+ worth of late equipment over 5 orders. How convenient it must have been to be disconnected from a ""problem"" customer, and be able to employ such shoddy customer service. My 8 year tenure with prime ends today.",0

I asked about this but courier person told me that I’ll get it from another courier representative.At evening second courier person came to give me my shoe but he denied to give it without replacement shoe, which I was already given to another Amazon courier person at afternoon.From 21st Nov., I had called 11 times to Amazon customer care about my issue and asked about my replacement product but, not got any answer from Amazon customer service.I have provided pick up tracking also but it is not working.

I am really surprised to see all of the negative reviews here. I am a very frequent customer and always receive great service. I just ordered a game we wanted quickly and it was here in less than 24 hours. I rarely have an issue with any orders and when I do it is on the vendor. I don't see how anyone cannot love Amazon.,2
Shopping is smooth and transportation is slow,1
items get returned to sender instead of delivered. not worth buying from,1
I probably spend 100K a year+ here for my business.they keep trying to get me to have a business account but from what I was told it would nix the free shipping on a ton of items.. why would I do that? it just doesnt seem worth it.,1
"I ordered a gift on Dec 2 and they have been lying to me ever since— jerking the delivery date back and forth. I finally called customer service and the first rep could barely speak English. I tried to be polite but she could not comprehend what I was asking. I demanded a rep in the US who could  understand English and when I got one ( after 20 minutes on hold) she did “get” what I was saying. She filed a stuck order ticket. So-Amazon then lied again and said the item would arrive on the 19th. I knew this was bull because the website STILL did not show it as having been shipped. As of today the site says it will arrive today which of course, is nonsense. Last time I heard from the customer service gal she said it won’t ship till the 28th 😡😡. This episode clearly proves that Amazon listed merchandise for sale for which they lacked sufficient stock to fill orders and instead of being honest, they lie lie lie. And I have been a prime member for well over a decade. Very very disgusted.",0
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.

Each time Ocado make a order, they take away the packaging from their last order and use it again.",1
Call amazon to return a package send the package back no problem now I have to wait until July 14 to get my refund and they have the package they are playing games with people money.

Super Slow Delivery... A bit disappointed,1
I don’t like Amazon because they advertise things for sale that are out of stock. I had a very bad experience just over a year ago when I bought a book. Like many people I ticked free postage.BEWARE! If you click Free Postage you will inadvertently sign up for Amazon Prime.I did not know I had done this until I had to change my bank card because of a security scare. I then had a phone call from Amazon saying they could not process my Amazon payments. I was horrified and thought it was a scam. I then rang the real Amazon and they told me I had signed up to Amazon Prime. I was appalled and cancelled my Amazon Prime account.I gave the card number of the expired card which was safe to do.  I then received a phone call from BT saying my call to Amazon had cost £80.BT refunded half of this as a goodwill gesture. Beware of signing up to Amazon Prime if you click Free postage. I lost several payments of £7.99 and £40 so lost about £80. Disgusting company who are conning and tricking people into signing up for Amazon Prime. I tried to download a kindle app the other day but discovered I could only use the app to read a book if I buy the book off Amazon. No chance!Other thing I hate about them: you can’t use PayPal.,0
"Recently, I have been having issues with my orders; receiving items that I did not order, receiving goodss that do not work (are defective), unable to return purchases, required to pay additional cost for goodss upon arrival, etc.  As a result, I have been spending too much time following up with Vendors, calling customer assistance, asking for refunds, and returning items; all defeating the purpose of online shopping.I believe that Amazon should spend more time in qualifying their Vendors.  Online shopping should be straight forward: 1) buy an item 2) receive the item ordered.Very disappointed.",1

"My usage with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the order company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
I just found out that you can no longer find a friend or family members wish list by simply typing in their name as that feature is no longer available.  You must email though amazon's site everyone that you want a list from and they must do the same to see yours. Making your list Public doesn't do anything.,0

"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!",1
Buyer beware!! Be aware that Amazon returns that show when you are making a purchase that it will be free is an untrue statement. The free return is nothing more than a shipping label or QR code. Amazon has found a way to charge for returns and hit the purchaser with a restocking fee even if an item is an absolutely perfect condition. So ultimately your refund is less than your purchase price and Amazon doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. I have to believe that Amazon got as big as they did as quick as they did by doing nothing more than take unnecessary money from the common people who can literally not afford to be charged undisclosed fees. The practice of saying free shipping and free returns is not what they are providing so that is either bait and switch or certainly unethical.,0
Amazon has been good to me so far. I have heard a few things here and there from other people but those were mostly with people dealing with actually selling on Amazon. So far so good. If their stock goes up more I will reward them with 5 stars. LoL ;) Come on Amazon.com! YOU GOT THIS,2
"I was shocked the first time I looked back through my order history to find an item I wanted to re-order. I cannot believe how many things I have purchased from Amazon in the past 5 years!!! It was an enlightening experience to go through soooo many pages, Amazon has become my automatic go-to site to purchase just about anything. I don't buy everything from them, but I darn sure look there first before I check any other websites. I am a disabled veteran and live in a home for disabled vets, and haven't left here in 4 years to shop as the busses cause me too much pain, so most of my purchases are online. Also we have around 650 members here and many have me find and buy items for them online as well. What else can I say but....Thank the Lord for Amazon.com!!!!",2
Crooks & thieves. I wouldn't touch them with a barge pole.,0
"Is a great company for shopping online never had a bad experience. My items always arrived on time. My items has been exactly what I ordered, and they have great prices",2
"Ordered a Thule Paramount Backpack 27l, Black on 15 July 2021 for $218.70On 21 July 2021, received a brandless fake brown coloured bag.Contacted Amazon customer service and their only answer is I have to arrange a return, and once the fake brown coloured bag has safely reached their warehouse, then they will refund me for their attempt to cheat me.The WORST experience ever, especially coming from the brand that is supposedly the richest in the world.",0
"Thank god for amazon! they are a life saver next day delivery sometimes on same day, much better to ebay ect I'm shocked they've got such a bad rating on ere??",2
"I have ordered many things from Amazon and I have never had a problem with this app.Fast delivery and amazing quality with each and every single package, I personally would use Amazon over any other app that delivers",2
STOLEN returns parcel  to be picked up by Royal Mail by Amazon courier . Impossible to get hold of customer care just a BOT,0
Use infrequently but seems satisfactory.,1
I’ve ordered hundred of products from here and have never had a problem and when I do it’s resolved immediately via live chat.,2
"I have a love hate relationship with Amazon. Most of the items are decent. Prime shipping is most of the time decent, but more times than not, my items are dropped at the wrong address, wrong size, broken or damaged, and the order drivers are something else. The customer assistance is pretty great. Amazon is decent for cheap, fast ordering. But don’t expect the best or it to be on time.",1
"Obviously a acceptable shop; however, there's scammers working at Amazon—make sure the reviews are legitimate.",1
"Send packages usually never broken, most I’ve gotten are decent quality they seem to be very quick where as other companies can take a week to arrive.i will bump it down to a 3 star because they did have to send back a ddr4 ram stick I bought because it was broken which is kind of annoying.",1
"I was happy until they switched over to this Amazon Logistics bull crap with 3rd party carries instead of using USPS. Gifts I ordered for shipment to family in a different state was left on side apartment door vs. in the lobby. Did not ring my mother's apartment to let her know they were there other times. Yesterday I was expecting a package, it shows delivered and I was fed some excuse by the customer support rep that some ""new drivers"" may be scanning packages of delivered before they are. While this may be a chance due to the holiday season, I am giving them today for the package to show. If it does not, I will be asking for a refund or for the goods to be re-sent.",1
"I thought I should put an opinion on here to balance all the angry ones. I've been a customer since 2005 so I have plenty of experience of dealing with them. Before this year, I never had any particular issue - of course, occasionally things were delayed, but the tracking on their website or external couriers tells you  the expected due date, so there are no surprises. The goods have been as described, with rarely the odd error which was corrected when they were notified.The reason I'm posting now is because this Christmas (2021) several things went wrong; two packages weren't delivered - they got stuck at customs and never reappeared - and three things I bought all broke (a phone, a smartwatch and a belt for bad backs). All were ordered from abroad, so returning the items was a little more complicated than usual and involved arguing in the local village post office, who had no idea what to do with the labels and forms. However, Amazon themselves couldn't have been more helpful. In one case they changed the return label for a different courier because DHL wouldn't collect the package (that's another story, 'computer says no'). I had to phone Amazon three times to sort things out, and they did everything to make it as painless as possible.Whether a large corporation should survive by gobbling up the opposition is another question...but Amazon are, in my experience, reliable and generally cheaper. That's why I'm still using them after all this time.",2
"They want to force you to subscribe to Amazon prime, if you don’t, they purposefully delay the order. Then they give you an approximate order date, eg. between the 10th - 15th of that month, it will always arrive on the last day! Why even bother saying it will arrive between these dates, if you will make sure it arrives on the very last day in any case? Does Amazon think that we are all stupid? ",1
fine. swift shipment also,1
Consistent and good,2
I placed a LARGE order through amazon and many items were considered undeliverable to the address and were returned by USPS. However that was on the 23rd of JUNE! I am now in JULY and still no refund has come across. I spoke with AMAZON and no person will give me a refund for the items I did not receive. It is crazy that they have no problem taking your 1k amount for the items you ordered but when it comes to getting a refund for the undeliverable items they will not give it. THANK YOU FOR STEALING MY MONEY AMAZON!,0
Always great packaging when I received my items. Always helpful when I needed help with any purchases.,2
"I love Amazon but I wish your drivers would just be given a little more time - they carry out a great job in getting things to me and my family but always seem so rushed, not even a time for a hello and a smile.",1
"Amazon no longer allows bad review of rogue sellers even though they deliberately try to scam buyers! The details are a bit mundane but here they are for completeness:The photo and description of an item listed on Amazon was the legal ""UK"" labelled sticker for a UK car numberplate. Instead, this retailer deliberately shipped the no-longer-legal ""GB"" labelled sticker. Presumably the seller had a lot of old useless illegal ""GB"" labelled sticker stock to be disposed of! The seller is counting on the majority of buyers not bothering to return the stickers they did not order because of their relatively low value. When a review describing the above was left on Amazon, Amazon refused to post it, stating that their policies did not allow criticism of sellers even if they are scammers as in this case. Clearly Amazon is not prepared to let honesty and protection of their buyers from rogue sellers get in the way of their obscene levels of profits. Shame on you Amazon!",0
Amazon is getting worse and worse!!   They should stand by their 3rd party vendors or dont use them!!   There should be a buy USA only filter.  I used to think Amazon had integrity.  Not anymore.,0
For a long time Amazon was number one with me. I have been a prime member for years. Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer assistance has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,1
"I've used Amazon as a consumer for years, always found them to have a good range of products and reasonable pricing.  I've also found they will stand behind their products if there's an issue - for example, I just recently completed getting a refund on an order that had been pending delivery for so long the online system no longer had a way to cancel it.  However, chat support took care of it in less than 5 minutes.  I'm happy, and will continue to be a regular customer.",2
"Before I shop anywhere else whether it be in-store or online I always check Amazon first, second, and last.  I am an Amazon Prime member and it is worth every penny.",2
"Wasn't the greatest support I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
"I love amazon, I buy many things on here, more then I should anyway. If I ever have any problems they always resolve it quickly.",2
"This is absolutely ridiculous, they lose your stuff and don’t even care. I’m paying prime for what? To be messed over and roll the dice they don’t lose my package? Get real…",0
Always had a great usage except for the one last time. i will come back edit this review if I have a acceptable usage next time.,1
I turn to Amazon for all my gift giving and hard to find shopping!  They are loyal and easy for refunds.  ,2
Absolute horrific customer service. I seriously doubt these people had any training and having bad manners is apparently part of their job description.,0
"I used your website for years and literally spent over $10,000. I can no longer support a website that doesn't value freedom, and quite literally inserts itself to make a political statement against a difference of opinion. I cancelled my Prime, and will shop else where. I'm not American but if this is allowed to stand it means more censorship going forward that you have no right to control. You are a online seller not a political party, or a party who gets to dictate free speech. I hope it was worth losing customers over.",0
"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer assistance used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer assistance but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",1
"It's a great support.. however, since I never know if I'm actually going to get what I paid for due to theft risk and order gamble. It would be nice to not have ""package delivered"" show on your order until it was actually delivered. It would also be nice if the drivers actually took packages to your door.",1
"After many years a loyal Customer it has now come to the point had enough of poor customer assistance.Ordering and order is excellent,but anything goes wrong with a appliance after thirty days it’s a uphill battle.Remember your contract is with Amazon ,not the manufacturer,but Amazon keep telling its not there problem.If it’s a third party ,then just give up as Amazon are not interested.There’s no way to complain , all emails that used to work bounce ,the agents won’t let you complain.So as soon as my refund that I’ve been waiting for 5 week arrives , if it ever does ,I’m closing my account.",1
"Hello,I am from Dublin.Amazon, from a consumer point of view, are really good.There customer service is VERY good and have had many good experiences with what should be bad ones. Most recent, I bought an power supply and  it didn't work for all intended purposes.I got Karen, amazon associate. She was good/great!. Got it sorted and i got a refund. 5 minutes!!How they deal with mistakes or issues is really refreshing.They are customer centric. So yeh Thank you Karen :)",2
pretty good experience,2
"This company does not look at good workers, the whole company employs people who only look out for their friends.  People who are hard workers are sacked within 2 weeks so their friends and family can grab these jobs. It's a joke when in this pandemic people are trying to make ends meet.  The warnings aren't even based on their policies or strategies!!!!! Do not work for this company its a joke, all the supervisors and teamleaders are out to get you so they can employ their friends and family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who don't speak English,  it's a JOKE!!!!!!",0
"Terrible delivery, down for 1430-1630never arrived. Rescheduled for up to 10pm yet driver per Amazon tracker passed within 0.5miles my address twice before heading off elsewhere. Rechecked at 2000hrs driver been sat at costa coffee for 1.5hrs. 2100hrs still no delivery.Called customer service who although polute couldnt or wouldnt help resolve when delivery would take place. No contact with driver available no map tracker update available per service representative. Thoroughly dissatisfied at the professionalism of this company. As a courier man myself you dont send a driver with hundreds of pounds worth of parcels out and have no way of contacting them. Pathetic excuses.......",0
Love amazon period!,2
"Their current procedure is based on the fact that even in the event that we have a problem on arrival or during the warranty period, we must return the package at our expense with a ridiculous little denomage to be able to be reimbursed or to have a exchange. If you are abroad and the volume / weight of the package is important, we often have a transport price higher than the price of the goods. Customer service pretends not to understand and tirelessly repeats the same unsuitable procedures. In my case, more than $400 in return costs for $20 in damages expected to recover $350 in reimbursement. Who are we laughing at? It's time to go back to smaller sites or a local merchant to still have a dialogue with a sensible human being rather than procedural machines.",0
Drivers kept leaving my parcel on door step whiles not at home and without me requesting a safe place alot of my parcels got stolen due to their drivers fault and instead of investigating they blocked my account permanently and blamed it on too many refunds instead of their drivers,0
"I will no longer support sites that suppress and infringe on the rights of the American People! I do not, nor will ever comply with communist ideologies that Amazon clearly supports.",0
Amazon double charges customers!!!! They are a bunch of thieves.,0

Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy,2
"I purchased an android 5G capable phone, on startup it took over an hour to complete, storage was 30% used - 70% available. It never recognized my fingerprint to unlock apps, and ran slower than my 3G android. I inquired a better refund explaining that I am mobile impaired. They insisted that I needed to bring it to the post office and send it that there was no way to have it picked up. Discontent but still agreeing I ordered a new phone upon its arrival I began to switch insensitive apps to the new phone and everything appeared to be fine I searched the internet so that I could probably factory reset the other phone to clear my data. I then began to reenter passwords and log into accounts and verify the IP address to the new device when I noticed that I didn't have administration rights on the new device because it hadn't completely wiped the old device and fragments of the applications remained. Which meant I needed to reboot the First new phone that I got so the IP address would register in the applications and I could make the transfer from within. After 4 hours of watching the screen turn and turn and tell me downloading and updating I powered off and put the phone away and try it again in a few hours. Extremely frustrated I called Amazon customer service back again today and made it very clear that they need to do something because I have to bring that phone now to a technician to have him go into the hard drive and extract my data. This is going to cost more than the phone is worth and Amazon refuses to do anything. I will happily return the phone but somebody needs to come and get it. It's winter time in Quebec I am mobile impaired how in the world do they expect me to get to a post office",0
I can't see that there's anything to complain about Amazon.  I keep the UPS driver very busy so I know what I'm talking about. 😁🙂Great company to deal with in every way.,2
"I have been an Amazon Prime member for at least 15 years and until the past 6 months to a year, I would have given Prime a 5-star review.  However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day order any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the assistance altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the assistance gets any worse.  I truly hate to see this happening because Amazon Prime has been a lifeline for me for years...my go-to when I needed something shipped to me fast and reliably.",1
I had bought several cellphone cases. The delivery from Amazon is fast and with great packaging. ,2

"Worst customer service I have ever encountered. My payment wasn’t going through due to an issue on their side. Was talked in circles by the customer service representative eventually the problem was solved not before I almost threw my phone out of sheer frustration dealing with the rep. Once the problem was solved I was then contacted again two minutes later asking what my problem was and how could they help. Upon informing them that my problem had already been fixed the new rep continued to ask my account details and what I needed fixed. No one listens, they are condescending and waste your time.",0
I would not even give them even one star. Since the virus thing they are only doing chats . These pples are not taking their job seriously more like a play ground full of kids not doing jobs correctly. They pass u from or person to next in space of 20 mins I chatted to 6 pples . None of then had a clue and could not be asked to read perious notes. Forever repeating uelf and they tire blind eye to their online delivery rime star stating what ties which I missed my delivery. I he been buying from these company fr time and once I get my orders I will be deltin my account and shopping else where like eBay or etc. Ths company don't have respect fr customers and too greedy fr money to the point they turn bind to their own B's.

All Christmas shopping purchased online. Absolutely everything arrived when they said it would and in great condition. I allowed a bit of extra time for delays as I assumed it would be a bit hit and miss at this busy time of year but it wasn't needed! Great communication about it all too. Very happy shopper :),2
"I've been a monthly customer of Amazon for years and have 2 primary complaints about the online shopping support. 1)I gave fare/honest reviews of merch I purchased - mostly an adequate rating, a few ordinary and a few excellent reviews - but Amazon removed my ability to review for a couple years now without adequate explanation. I feel duty bound to warn other customers about items I've purchased that are advertized fraudulently or defective, which Amazon does not allow me to do. I expect Amazon as a middleman support suffers from conflict of interest when it comes to the various companies for which they brokers, so it censors reviews for the businesses it's too close to, in order to protect its sells. This is siding with these companies that sell substandard merchandise against Amazon members, and should immediately stop. Ever paying Amazon shopper should have an unhindered right to review the items they paid for.2) Amazon listings needs to clarify differences in sizing scale when merch is manufactured in different countries, which it most often fails to do. For example, I cannot tell you number of times I purchased items manufactured in China, according to Chinese sizing scale - which is about 2-sizes smaller than US sizing - without being warned by Amazon. The result being, merchandise That doesn't fit - clothes, backpack, laptop case - I either haveto go through headache of returning, just givaway, or trash.",1
Almost every delivery has to be tracked down at a neighbors residence.  I won't be returning.A shame a good business model being ruined by people who dont seem to care shouldn't have to go under a car to retrieve a package.,0
"I used to be a faithful buyer from Amazon, they used to be my first stop when shopping, but no more.  They raised the minimum purchase for ""SuperSaver Shipping"" from $25 to $35, making it tougher to save money on shipping costs.  Then they started charging sales tax, which adds 7% to the cost of anything I buy from Amazon.  I no longer stop at Amazon first to buy as they always seem to be a more expensive place to shop.  It is a shame Amazon, I spent a bundle at your store in the past, but no more!",1
"I love the amazon website.  I spend many hours browsing on the site creating wishlists for all the books I would buy if I could!  I find the service very easy to use, well laid out and appealing.  The site usually offers interesting alternative books which other people with similar taste have looked at our bought.   When I want a treat I buy myself a book(s) on Amazon, simple!",2
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve items with so-so quality,1

"Funny company, don't know how they got to be so big, or are they? Logged in as usual, placed some products in my cart as normal, paid what I had to pay, and rested I will get my products as any normal person. I Guess Amazon had other plans for me, like why should I benefit from their products, who am I to attempt buying from them, like what are my titles, and what's my social status to even dream about being their costumer. So, to resume the issue, I paid and waited, they sent me an email that there was a suspicious payment and they needed to look into it. Asked for more details and proof that I was the person paying with my own card. They've asked for the payment statement(which I couldn't see because the payment was pending on their side) Sent them all the proof and maybe even more than I should have, they got to me saying it's not enough. Got more info that I am the owner of the card from my payment provider, sent them that too, guess what... Got an email stating they must close my account and there is nothing else to be talked about hahahahahahahahahah ahahahaha ahhahahahGarbage company! I can't believe it! Good there are plenty of options out there, hope they go down soon like they deserve. Have a great day everyone! And remember, keep you mental health and money safe and stay away from Amazon.",0

"I have never felt more disrespected or abused by customer service in my entire life. I'm not even one to write bad reviews...but I have to vent out my frustration somehow because goodness knows the Amazon support team won't listen. Long story short (including several phone calls, being transferred to several departments, and hours on the phone), I was promised IN WRITING a refund for an item I ordered. I was instructed to give them a call when the item arrived, and ""rest assured"" I'd receive a refund. I even called again to confirm this would be the case before making the order...and was assured. Well, the item was delivered. I call them up. They literally said. ""Sorry, we have to BREAK OUR PROMISE to you and we can't process this refund. Sorry, there is nothing we can do. I'm going to disconnect the call."" CLICK. That was from a supervisor. I truly couldn't believe it. I actually cried from anger and frustration. SCAMAZON is right. Avoid like the plague.",0
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their assistance, their items and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer assistance representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements.

"I dont have any issues ordering with amazon and they usually have straight forward ordering and returns process. However, whenever I try to contact customer service this isn't an easy process. I recently tried to set up a business account, it locked me out when I was in the process of creating one and then I tried to contact customer services 3 times in a week and every time they said that I would be contacted within 24 hours which I wasn't. All I need is for someone to unlock the account and I'm not sure why their customer service is so terrible they can't do that. Anyone hoping to get through to customer services, brace yourself because it seems like everyone tries to pass the issue to another department and the issue is never resolved. To this day, my issue isn't resolved.",0
"I have been an Amazon customer since the very beginning - in the UK, the US and now France. I think their service quality is astonishingly good. Living in rural France it is a lifesaver. Just recently I have had my first returns and they were handled quickly and without fuss - maybe thanks to my many, many orders over the years. I think they should pay far more tax and pay their employees way more money - and I'd be happy to pay an extra 15% if I was confident it was going to staff wages.",2
Amazons 3rd party sellers are horrible. I ordered wheels from one seller and tires from another. The wheels are lost somewhere in transit and the tires where delivered  missing 2 out of 5 tires.Amazon needs better rules and guidelines to be a 3rd party seller.,0
"The general convenience and shipment assistance I've received has always been great. Though I've had two separate issues with being able to leave reviews. The first was I was randomly not allowed to do so. The second was that a review had been taken down with no more than a vague explanation, and a link to all their rules, which isn't helpful for letting me alter my review to follow reviewer standards. This also makes me concerned of the validity of customer reviews and how they're filtered though.I also spent a while seeing if I could reach customer support without either calling, or being in active conversation with them and no luck. Can't stand companies that intentionally make it difficult to contact them.",1

"Every time I have to contact customer service whether an item has become faulty in the warranty period, my little one ordered movies on my account or when I broke my kids tablet by accident they have been brilliant either full refund or sent a new item. Times when my item has not been delivered I get an email to say attempted I ask customer service to try again as was in and they make sure the driver trays again.

"I would put a zero if I could. First of all I have multiple packages together so I choose the latest day for my delivery to get here so that all of it would be together. They keep saying that one of my packages will get here today but the other two are already out for delivery and the other one is not even out. This is ridiculous. If they can’t deliver on the dates that THEY provided, they need to give accurate days of when it will actually get here.

They charge 2.99 for overnight delivery or faster delivery and 9 times out of 10 you order will say delivered but it’s not there. It usually shows up but that’s not what I payed extra for. They should take the charge off if they are late on delivery.,0

Amazon  customer care number 8247721430 goods related quairy . I have only used amazon prime vendors and have had absolutely no issues. Amazon has always shipped on time and had an easy no hassles return policy if a goods was defective. I can’t say the same for other vendors such as Best Buy or Walmart.,1

My packages have been late at least 6 times this month and another 4 the month before. I think it’s excessive to be late. It’s guaranteed to get there on that date as instructed by them. They make up they needed to check another fulfillment center which is ridiculous then don’t put that it’s available. I have several fulfillment centers and they don’t deliver on time.,0
"Dont try to buy anything guaranteed same day. I haven't had anything delivered same day even though guaranteed. Full of excuses about things being out of their control. This time, the items I bought are Amazon items, not delivered same day because of delay but rescheduled for delivery today. Still nothing due to issues ""beyond their control"". Their warehouse is 15 minutes from my house. There were 3 Amazon vans in my housing area all at the same time while I was driving home from work. How can their product being delivered by their vans less than 15 minutes away be out of their control 2 days straight? Then, when I ask for a refund, I get the run around and my status on the orders say I refused the packages when they delivered. IT WAS NEVER DELIVERED!!! This is the 3rd time they pulled this crap. The first two times they promised gift cards (which I never received). I don't need them anyways. Goodbye prime, goodbye Amazon!!",0
Apparently these people have no understanding of the fact that packages should not be left inside of a fence with dogs! I even left specific delivery instructions on my account and they still can't figure it out,0

I wasn't the happiest about the shipping because the seller never gave a tracking # or confirmation of shipping, so I had no idea why it was taking so long to just ship out one little purse then all of a sudden came in the mail one day. I hate that because we have had issues with carriers delivering to wrong address! If I can't see I'm supposed to be getting it how will I know if it got shipped somewhere else or if I'm still waiting!I can't imagine why they don't want to post it! It's not my fault the seller didn't give a tracking # like everyone else in the world does!",0
"Bought quite a few gadgets from Amazon. Cameras, Satnav, Kindle etc. Good price, quick delivery. Thats what I like...",2
All of Amazon's reviews are fake. 95% of the products come from China and are toxic. Items never get delivered on the dates shown upon purchase. Customer service is nothing but rude people from India. This is the worst subscription service I've ever had. Amazon is the wealthiest company on the face of the earth and this is the best they can do. How pathetic! ,0
"I unfortunately don’t have the representatives names, but I had an item never show up. I contacted the customer support for a replacement. The lady who I first talked to LIED saying she could expedite the replacement and get it to me in 2 days. After 4 days, it still never showed up and the statement on my order said Jan. 8. The lady whom I talked to after the 2nd order was placed, said they could not expedite any replacement item and was quite surprised another representative would tell me that. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon who has an interactiond representative LIE TO A CUSTOMER. However, the Second Lady who Told me they could not expedite my order was nothing but absolutely wonderful.",1
always expansive,1
"If you write a truthful review of poor service on Amazon it will be censored, I've gotten total crap and they wouldn't allow my reviews to be posted",0
"I ordered 2 items and was charged in full for both.  My credit card showed this transaction then 2 more transactions for $25.00 each.  I tried the website to find customer service, no go.  I used a web search to get the number and the automated answering was a waste of time.  When I finally got a human it was plain to see that that she was in India.  Never got a real answer so I cancelled the product that was out of stock but that they charged me again.  Well, they cancelled the original transaction and rebilled the $18 that was still coming but the other charges which do not have an order number are still pending.  I tried the credit card company and got the same responses.  If I wanted to talk to someone that doesn't have a clue I would contact their customer service.",0

Amazon is a staple for my Xmas shopping. They make any gift giving an easy task even for the pickiest people. I go to Amazon for everyone & their variety of products make shopping so easy.,2
"HORRIBLE service! Never got two of the items I had ordered on 4/5 that was supposed to be here by the next day 4/6. By 4/12 I had contacted them TWICE asking what's going on after I had gotten a notice that the delivery had been CANCELED as I did NOT cancel the order. The 1st time I contacted them and asked them why the order had been canceled they claimed the order was NOT canceled and that I should get it soon (LMAO YEAH RIGHT). even though my tracking link said otherwise that my order was being sent back to amazon as they had canceled it. 5 DAYS LATER STILL NO DELIVERY. Such a waste of time and they are such CROOKS! Just want your money and think you will forget about it! TOTAL SCAM! I don't see how Amazon is allowed to stay in business with such SHADY business practices. They finally gave me a refund after telling me the order WAS CANCELED like I had told them it was originally, so I could reorder, and they had also told me they would refund me a month's payment of PRIME for my trouble and all the TIME I wasted since the product did NOT come in a timely manner as it did not even come at ALL! Now I am STILL waiting for my refund for THAT. I'm sure I will have to contact them AGAIN about that to get my refund for my membership. Will be canceling membership ASAP as they have gone downhill and cannot support such a crappy business who does NOT EVEN HONOR THEIR OWN PROMISES AND DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. JUST GROSS!  Customers should NOT have to keep at a company over and over again to ensure that the company does WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. Would give ZERO stars if I could!! :/",0
Amazon is awesome and has great customer service. The end.,2
"I always check Amazon first, will look at prices elsewhere sometimes but usually best price is through Amazon. Easy site to use and delivery dates are clearly shown. Bought items very straightforward to track. Great company.",2
A decent site but have had my card details hacked into twice!,1
"Delivery is not as advertised but eventually comes, if you are a prime member they do look after you, so on the whole ok. Could be better, next day should mean next day though amazon",1
"No need to review the store... That's all decent. Even great. Huge goods range, relatively fast and cheap shipment options to New Zealand. What's not to like?Well, Amazon Prime video... The movies and TV shows they offer to NZ customers are better than Netflix NZ, but it is impossible to watch 'em. Due to that stupid Google vs Amazon discussion, you can't stream via Chromecast (yeah, cast via computer = annoying as it's in the other room and screen mirroring on mobile isn't reliable).Amazon's Firestick isn't available in NZ... Roku is shipped to NZ but then the Amazon Prime channel isn't available. Unless you do the VPN trick but then Amazon blocks videos that should be available in NZ. It's just impossible to use Amazon Prime in NZ. Cancelled the subscription. Back to the more-or-less-crappy alternatives, we have here.",1
"I have been an Amazon customer for many years and also as a Prime customer. The main reason is because of their normally excellent returns policy. I've just started a return for an item within the returns timeline only to have to jump through hoops and several arguments to get them to accept the return.Now the main reason for me to buy from Amazon has been destroyed. Someone needs to change this policy of belligerence. However it won't be me, I'm going to buy from elsewhere. The replacement for this product, is twice the price of the return, but I've placed an order with another retailer now.",0
I love Amazon! I did all my christmas shopping on here and saved £'s and £'s,2

"Having tried to order a Concept 2 Rowing Machine and after going as far as shipping address (delivers within 1 to 20 days apparently) Amazon will not deliver to Northern Ireland (an address, within the United Kingdom) After contacting the Team no conclusion was reached.

"The first week of March, 2019...I left Gillette a negative review based upon their Anti-Male commercial.  My review ranking, at that time, was around 9,000.  Within one week the review was removed and my review ranking shot to 61,542,907.  I called their Customer Service Team and their Dispute Resolutions Team and they both sent questions and forms to the only people that could help me...the Communities Team.  After hearing NOTHING from them I called both the Customer Service Team and the Dispute Resolutions Team and both said they felt like they were being ignored by the Communities Team.  Four weeks passed and I FINALLY got in touch with the Communities Team and all they have done is copy and paste things to me that relate to none of my concerns or questions, demand info from me that relates to nothing that is happening and threaten to shut down this investigation if their demands are not met.  Here is one demand.  What is the URL of the page you are having problems with.  I've mentioned over and over and over that the URL is my profile page.  I've given them my profile name and everything and yet they demand from me something I've already told them...and threaten to shut everything down if I don't tell them.  Ugh...  Did I also mention that in week 3 I found, on Amazon, a forum that the Communities Team runs. I tried to ask them a question on there but when I pushed the ""create thread"" button my question was immediately marked as spam.  So, anyway, this is week 5 of everything.  In retaliation for me complaining and with more helpful votes, my review ranking was dropped 400,000 to 61,973,473.Moral of the story here...  Amazon censors and punishes anyone who doesn't tow the Far-Left line.  They are a petty and vindictive company.",0
"I have been a customer for almost a decade now. The only time things go awry is if I haven't bothered to read the reviews about an item I purchased or items never arriving. Not reading the reviews is my own fault. Items not arriving or not delivered directly to me have always been replaced immediately by Amazon at no extra cost. They've always been good to me despite a few mishaps. Staff are polite and helpful. I've even got to know the delivery drivers quite well.Unlike some other major players (CEX) I have nothing, but praise for them and hope to continue being a customer for another decade at least.Keep up the good work ladies and gentlemen.",2
"Where is customer service? it seems that amazon only has robots, if everything goes Ok, it's ok, if something goes wrong, ""computer says no"" Very concerning company. I would not like to rely on it, but people think: what if there is not any other company left?and you would have to buy essential stuff to live? And ""computer says no""?",0
"Being able to conveniently have my dog's specific, medically-needed, food delivered to her temporary caretaker, 40 miles aways from my home & work is an absolute joy. And, at the best price anywhere! A simpler website to navigate, without pushing additional costs, would make for 5 stars.Thanks Amazon!",2
"I use amazon ALOT and after a friend told me about ‘vine customers’ I made sure to write helpful reviews in the hope I’d be selected as one! Amazon removed my reviews and said I wasn’t allowed to review anymore as they thought I had posted a bias review for a friend or family member! The operator agreed that they couldn’t understand why as the item I had reviewed was Christmas cards, n I had bought about 30 of them all the same kind, but from different sellers on amazon and I left pretty much the same review for all of them! The one seller had no relation and the seller was miles & miles away! Amazon refused to tell me why they thought it was a dodgy review and wouldn't look into it further! So now I can’t become s vine customer and I wasted hours n hours writing helpful reviews! Oh and amazon allows pictures from reviews to be used on other websites as my face is plastered on an online article and the picture that was only posted on an amazon review!",0
Prime is not what it used to be! Tell you one date and it’s out for delivery then they reschedule for 5 days later. poor service. You speak to a bot it says it won’t be delivered till January and then gives you two options refund or you’re ok with it. Great!,0
Great as always thank you,2
"I have had a relationship with Amazon from when it was first mentioned in the Wall Street Journal as a small startup company selling books.  Now I order something at least several times a month, usually more often.  It is my first shopping choice, whether online or off. Whenever I have had a question about something and have emailed them, I get a quick response.  I love the free shipping for orders over $25 so always take advantage of that.  Service is excellent.  Product always what it says it is.  As far as I am concerned, it started the online shopping and still is the best there is.",2
"Returned a gtv formula box item had already been open the batteries out the packaging other packaging opened and  they got there it’s back within 3 days and held my refund for another 4 days after I had to call to get them to process the refund then they tell me it’s gonna be another 7 to 10 days for me to get it probably sometime in {xxxxx} July. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had do not shop at Amazon . They ain’t nothing but a bunch of crooks selling a bunch of generic stuff and then when you complain about them selling you stuff that’s been open they don’t want to take the stuff back or take their time about giving your money, we need to go back to shopping stores and leave Amazon Amazon right where it is the Customer Service can’t even understand they barely can speak English ",0
"So much has changed with Amazon and not for the better. Late deliveries , not refunding returns and real bad customer service. ",0
I have always found Amazon to have excellant customer service.Any time if I have had an issue with anything they are straight on it.If I ever need to speak to anyone online always very happy to help.For me this is important and that’s why I shop at Amazon online.,2
"Can't go wrong. Excellent products, awesome quality. On time delivery. Return is just butter. I swear by Amazon. Lol!",2
"I order many items for personal and business from Amazon.  Generally, the items from Amazon direct are delivered on time and work well.  However, in my recent experiences with refurbished computers and electronics I received several defective products from Amazon third party sellers.  The third party sellers did not respond for refunds or returns.  Amazon did NOT stand behind their A to Z Guarantee.  After several emails and phone calls to their customer service, it was a miserable experience. They misrepresented their return to me and never provided a refund.  I don't think the A to Z guarantee is real???   I learned my lesson, NOT to buy from anymore third party sellers, as Amazon won't warranty their products.",0
best delivering compony in the world you deliver my day in a good way and bring the stuff we get in a couple of days like a breeze I love amazon,2
Buyer beware!! Be aware that Amazon returns that show when you are making a purchase that it will be free is an untrue statement. The free return is nothing more than a shipping label or QR code. Amazon has found a way to charge for returns and hit the purchaser with a restocking fee even if an item is an absolutely perfect condition. So ultimately your refund is less than your purchase price and Amazon doesn't seem to care about customer satisfaction. I have to believe that Amazon got as big as they did as quick as they did by doing nothing more than take unnecessary money from the common people who can literally not afford to be charged undisclosed fees. The practice of saying free shipping and free returns is not what they are providing so that is either bait and switch or certainly unethical.,0
"Items sold are original and authenticated. We can blindly trust on amazon. Also the transition period of fines generally remains short. But, one demerit what I observed is, the PRICE of the items which remains a little more than the other shopping sites like flipkart and paytm. Even in the sale(offer) period, the price of various items is raised to fill up the discount.",1
Excellent service totally reliable in contrast to Boots. See review of online service there!!,2
"It used to be that if I purchase more than $35, it usually was Free Shipping.  Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1
I have ordered with Amazon around 40 times always a good experience!!,2
Good and easy returns,2
Been a bit delay recently but guess just near the Christmas.,1
It took longer than expected and the customer assistance was not the best ,1
"Yeah, they kind of took over the world, right. They do fine. Not great or spectacular, fine.",1
With Prime membership my orders are not delivered! Good job Amazon!!,0

"Refused to issue a refund - THEIR error.  Bought a pair of OTC hearing aids for $500.  Clearly stated returnable until 1/31/24.  I didn't like them, so sent them back in the original packaging.  They claim I returned an OLDER MODEL (which I of course have never owned), and they couldn't issue a refund.  No proof of what they stated.  Geez.  Unbelievable.",0
great price great offer,2
Anything & Everything Wat ever you need this place contains. Even if u think u cant find it u can.  But problems are sometimes packaging. Other than that.  If money was always pouring into accounts it would really b endless shopping,2
"Buying at Amazon is always a pleasant experience. The on-line shop is well organized. It is easy to find the article of you choice and having user reviews available is invaluable to make up your mind. One-click ordering is so much easier than any other web-shop. It is also easy to understand the status of your order while it is being processed and shipped. In the unlikely event that you want to return an article, Amazon is a pleasant experience as well.",2
I'm on a call with Amazon now about a return and the advisor on the call has one of the best customer services telephone manners. I've experienced similar with Amazon before as well so appears like a consistent thing. Great to know they've kept their customer first tradition.,2
I know people who work at their warehouse and they love their jobi also use amazon a lot and can’t complain. Even when they things go wrong its always solved asap,2
"its a great place to buy, just be carefull choosing the seller.",2
Tried to buy a glasses cleaning kit today.. Amazon kept flipping to a new page Pushing me to upgrade to Prime.. OVER and OVER again... Would backup and look at product 10 sec later it flipped my page again!!! Gave up on Amazon and bought from another WEB Site...  Do not buy often from Amazon because of poor Website that just pushes what they want you to buy... Not what I want...,0
Amazon delivered my package on the wrong porch! 😤 Now I have to go next door and look like a PACKAGE THIEF!! 🤦🏽‍♀️,1
Great concept with the Prime! subscription. 1-2 days delivery almost everytime.,2
"So I order all the time off of Amazon, never had to many complaints until recently. They have shipped a few wrong orders, though I was able to get them replaced fairly easily, it was hours on the phone, and running in to mail a package back to them. The reason I ordered from Amazon with that purchase was that I needed it fast with the wrong order being sent twice was not able to use it. Then even more recently I have found that all the Amazon apps are kinda completely annoying. I used to have kindle, shopping, video and music apps. The problem is that when I tried to use my husband's account that has prime for the shopping app and my account for everything else, it would sign me out of all the apps on my phone. There seems to be no option to sign in with different accounts for different apps. Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download. Extremely frustrating.",1

Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1
"Everything about Amazon is great, even customer service, if you can find them. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is that they make you jump through hopes to call customer service. I got an email stating I didn't return an item I return a month ago. I had to login and search the website for 5 min in order to send them my phone # so they can call me back? This actually made the phone call easier because i didn't have any phone prompts and it took 2 min to fix everything. But why was it so hard to figure out how to contact them?",2
Ordered an item for delivery on the 21st June and waited in all day as time was up till 8pm. Surprise surprise no delivery and a whole day wasted.,0

"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer assistance woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer assistance calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after shipment before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other items minutes after shipment.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1
Amazon is a worthy competitor to Walmart. The vast variety of choices coupled with excellent customer service makes Amazon one of my two choices for just about everything I need. ,2
"Very bad experience,  I don't advice any person to buy from them, they make me very disappointed with my order, getting too much late, when I called them to verify, they shown careless like they don't care and asked me to check with courier.

It’s my card where is my data protection?? Absolutely stupid uneducated people working behind the scenes at Amazon and to allow one of their customers to continue to use my card is outrageous!!! I’ve had to block the card so that no more transaction come from this card but for Amazon not to remove my card is a joke it’s my card and they have breached my data protection due to me making them aware of this fraud and for their manager to do sweet FA!!!!",0
"Over the years I have spent thousands of pounds at Amazon. Puchasing from distance sellers is often a leap of faith - but not with Amazon. Should I be looking for high-value items I need to know that the supplier can be trusted to honour their commitments and service promises. Never once have I had a single bad experience or cause for complaint, and for this reason alone I am happy to forego reasonable price fluctuations with occasionally lower prices elsewhere as I know that I'll not be left high-and-dry with a problem. Basically, Amazon have got it right and afford their customers with the consideration and respect that is reflected in their deeds and service policy. For this reason, Amazon will get my preferential loyal custom for as long as their exemplary service continues.",2
"Awful company. Refuse to refund payments for wrong deliveries, missing deliveries stated as being 'stolen' by customer service but nothing done about it, customer service always saying I'd be contacted within 24 hours by email or phone, but that never happens.

"I am gobsmacked by these people. I cannot understand the arrant stupidity of not following the delivery instructions and just leaving an electrical item outside, well away, 20 yards,from the front door, in the middle of winter when rain is highly likely.I was in, the item could have been dropped and the doorbell rung....and then there is absolutely nowhere to complain to. I will have to review my future use of this firm following this experience",0
Very good service. Protect customer.,2
Sad to say Amazon is getting worse. Talking to customer support doesn't correct the problem. My problem Amazon have started to leave deliveries on the door step and not waiting just drop and walk.

"Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime. It just seems more like a waste of money to me.But I've never had an issue with Amazon itself.",1

Customer service is horrible. I made a purchase for my granddaughters birthday. The package was delivered to my house instead of my granddaughters.

Been a week without any washing machine and the whole process has been utterly useless. Tried phoning their customer care people and got nowhere. Will never use this company again for purchases like this as other companies provide a far better and more comprehensive service. Amateurs!",0
I've been very happy with Subscribe and Save.,2
Amazon stop using Hermes. They are useless. Or at least state on the order you are using them so we can then not order> They are your suppliers so start taking responsibility instead of passing the buck. I say again in case you are the only ones who do not know (or do not want to know) Hermes are useless. Goods not turned up. No idea when they will,0

"Amazon is truly amazing. I am a long time customer and recently I ordered a down alternative comforter and it was delivered, However I made a mistake or someone in the house did and I could not locate the package.  I called Amazon and I told them that I did not receive my package. They issued a refund . I subsequently found my package and I called Amazon back and asked them to cancel the refund . They told me they had no way of canceling the refund, and I did not have to return the item, and I could keep my comforter as a happy holiday gift from Amazon. Now, that's what I call EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! TY AMAZON!",2
Got my tissue paper roll within 13hours of ordering. Thankyou so much for quick service guys.,2
Happy though still some problems in it. Nowadays make delay for item shipment,1
I order a pocket watch for my grandfather and it was not working I contact amazon and they send the replacement very quickly with not additional charge.,2
I was able to purchase some old books I had been looking for for a long time. The book is The Black Book of Communism. It was written by 6 frenchmen. Everyone should read it. Excellent.,2
Great company to deal with!,2

Sometimes there are a few problems with Amazon.,1
"unfortunally,amazon canada use intelcom to deliver their parcel. this courrier leave the parcel in the lobby of the building. this happen all the time,despite a very clear notice from the landlord to not leave the parcel in the lobby. the driver do not take the elevator to put the parcel at the door of the suite. they even not ring to see if they are someone at home.  they have been many parcel stolen.  amazon know that issue and do nothing about it. one alternative work well. you request amazon to deliver at your local post office. whitout this i will not buy at amazon to avoid the delivery by this unfamous intelcom.",0
"Prices are still acceptable but assistance going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer assistance and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"So sick of this company. #1 I pay a huge amount for prime and they never ship , 2 day anymore. #2 used the wrong credit card and within seconds if placing the order on 11/29 I hit cancel order to redo it. Wouldn't let me so I called. Woman said too late order was in shipping already. Lie #1!! On 12/6 I got an email that credit card was denied I needed to update credit card. Clicked link several times wouldn't let me update the card. Live chat guys says order shipped can't change payment method would recv on the 8th. Lie #2 Umm no not right. Puts me on hold comes back says credit card declined need to update card. AGAIN  it won't let me!! He's useless and says someone will call me. Finally ab English speaking rep!! But sge can't help me had to transfer me to a different Dept that can. This rep lie #3 orders already shipped can't change credit card. Are ya kidding me?? I'm about to lose it now. Finally she says oh your bank declined the card you have to call them. Ummm no I know it declined the cards no good as I already told her!! After going around and around for 20 minutes I tell her just cancel the order. She says fine it's cancelled. That was hours ago order still isn't cancelled!! So sick of reps that cannot understand English!!",0
"Everything okay, sometimes I get order faster sometimes not. I only buy through Amazon, not 3rd person. But one annoying thing they do not accept different recensions than 100% positive, if you wanna put truly opinion they will not accept your recension. That's scamming of people.",1
"It’s okay, amazon is cool for gadgets though",1
"It's a great support.. however, since I never know if I'm actually going to get what I paid for due to theft risk and shipment gamble. It would be nice to not have ""package delivered"" show on your order until it was actually delivered. It would also be nice if the drivers actually took packages to your door.",1
I have ordered numerous counterfeit items off Amazon in the last couple months. I also noticed my spa chemicals no longer work. I had to empty tub 2 times in 6 weeks. Frog chemicals now show up with clear tape on them. I’m sure they will say so it doesn’t leak but they used to last 6 weeks and do a good job now they last 3 weeks at most and tub turns green. I have not changed any products and spa is not even 2 yrs old. What are they putting in there . I also only see 4 and 5 star reviews on ever post except this page I had to search for. Amazon is selling counterfeit items and who knows what’s in my chemicals,0
"Pretty wholistic service.  Online movies on demand, fast shipping, good return system.  My go to vendor for almost anything.  The non-amazon vendors on the amazon listings can be a little more sketchy.  Good stuff.",2
"Horrible. They suspended my account due to what they say ""Unusual Activity"" Bs..I've had my Amazon account for many years. They should check into the ppl that there hiring for these companies..Most of them are FRAUDS and SCAMMERS! THEN THEY HAD THE NERVE TO STILL CHARGE MY CARD FOR PAYMENTS...GO TO HELL AMAZON",0

"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was acceptable timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer assistance, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your assistance is no longer acceptable.",1
"Got same day delivery and was chuffed, driver was great too",2
"Amazon USED to be great! However, I have found them to be falling off the last two years or so...all of a sudden there is a proliferation of vendors selling such extremely poor quality yet overpriced Chinese merchandise as to be actually frightening.  The supposedly free ""two day shipping"" more often than not turns into a week or more. Items are being delivered by the USPS, which is not known for promptness nor gentleness-my last item was deliverrd in a padded bag that had a large tear and black streaks. I will certainly be immensely more reticent about placing future orders with Amazon. A shame...",1
"Their customer service have NO IDEA what they are doing!I reported a major issue with my account whereby I could not view any items on my wish list or old orders, also could not open any item to see the full details or add to a cart.I spent 3 hours being passed from one operator to another and at the end I was told other customers was having the same issues and should be resolved shortly.I left it 3 days and tried again, same issue!  Again I contact customer support, been pushed from one person to another and keep asking for same original info (glad I made a list I could copy and paste)!I have had no issues in the past and only 2 days before this started I had viewed and added items to my wish list!  This is a problem their end, I can use Amazon.co.uk without any issues.All they say is please stay connected I am working on it and then push it to someone else!TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!",0
New Amazon Delivery Scam BEWAREAmazon have now introduced passwords for delivery drivers for high value itemsThis is being abused by drivers asking for password and then claiming item not in van Customer service refusing to refund and stating was delivered using excuse of password being provided  BEWARE NEW AMAZON SCAM involving the use of delivery passcodes - this is to protect amazon not you !do not purchase anything valuable from amazon totally unreliable,0

"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank decentness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your support we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
"I have been buying stuffs from this website that ranges from simple music to books to merchandise for the past couple of years. I never had (so far) any problems with the quality of the products, the delivery time is always within the specified date range.One of the things that I do like is the fact that I am able to track my packages almost in real time.It is one website for online shopping that I certainly trust and would definitely recommend to anyone.",2
"I cannot get enough: subscribe and save, next day service, and lots of add ons.",2
Greatest customer-centric company on the planet.,2
I am living in the uk and I have a British bank account as well as German account because I have moved 5 years ago to the UK. It is not possible to send from a German Amazon account or 🇬🇧 account anything to my family and friends. All payments declined even i have enough money on the German and British bank account. I guess thank Boris! Or What?,1
"Overall, amazon is terrific. The prices may not be the best, but the fast shipping makes it worth it. They mess  up shipping maybe 1 out of ten orders, but you come to expect that their quality has declined as their prices have increase",2
Got my kitty litter delivered but it was clumping kitty litter and we have had ice and snow which is now melting and amazon leaves the kitty litter in the water from melting snow and ice. Why can't the amazon driver knock on the door . I was home but didn't know he showed up so now my kitty litter is useless because it has clumped up . What  is wrong with amazon !,0
"A so-so usage, the shipper never called me when they didn't meet me so many times they dropped the package outside the door, never cared that the properties inside are expensive or not.",1
"I'm disabled and don't get out and about much.  I very much appreciate Amazon's range of goods, especially the books, and the value is tremendous.  I have found the most outlandish things on Amazon, such as a Flywhisk for Himself to use when walking the dog on the common in high summer.  If I want something, chances are I'll find it on Amazon. SO much easier than trying to make my way through crowds in my wheelchair!  I do most of my Christmas and Birthday shopping on Amazon now.  So easy, great prices and often postage free delivery.",2
"I am writing this review not in reference to any of the supplied goods from Amazon, which I have mostly always been happy with. Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.I appreciate the fact that when things went wrong that weren't even your fault, that you fixed them for me. Thanks.",2
Never had a problem with any orders. Great service.,2
"I really love the item range at Amazon.com However, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD) If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me. Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of support from Amazon.",1
"I have been using Amazon for years and years! I can honestly say that I have not had any issues. When I've had to make returns I have managed to do that using their online resolution centre easily and as I have followed their guidelines, have received a refund with no problem!",2
"I have brought lots of things from Amazon and I do love the company, however I ordered something so exciting in about March time and it never ever turned up, I got an email saying they had received the order but it never turned up, need my money back 😩",1
I don't understand how I buy an item from you then you tell me you bought it from a 3rd party there's nothing I can do to help you!!!! WOW!!! That's crazy to me. Amazon you lost me today!!!!,1
"I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!",2
"I recently reviewed my bank statement and noticed chsrges for Amazon subscriptions that I did Not authorize. After further review o noticed that they had been charging my account for many months in 1 case 1 subscriptions was more that 8 months. After asking to have this unauthorized subscriptions canceled and to be reimbursed i was told that they would only reimburse me for 3 months🤦‍♀️ They've been taking money from me for over 10 months on 2 accounts and you're only gonna reimburse me for 3 months...they are ""stealing"" money from me. This is Not the 1st time that ive had a problem with Amazon and unauthorized subscriptions. After the 1st time i started checking my Amazon account on a more frequent basis to ensure thst i didn't have this problem again...i know that i didn't do it monthly but goodness this is crazy. Also I'm a Prime member and 1 of the charges was for Prime music...a ""benefit"" to being a Prime member is Prime Music but they tried to say maybe i ""searched"" for music that wasn't included with Prime. I Don't use Prime for any type of mysic because i have Sirius XM. Im frustrated, disappointed and upset. Im doing this review so that other Prime members can be alerted to Amazon Shenanigans and how they are ""Stealing""",0
"I ordered an item to be delivered in two days. It has not arrived.  I am leaving my destination on 12/31. I cannot sit around and wait for someone who may deliver a product that should have been here already. Their delivery continues to deteriorate. Packages are tossed over a railing, in plain view. That makes it easier to steal. Amazon use to be reliable.  We use them at least once a week. I may have to find a more reliable company.",0
Power SaversDespite being fraudulent Amazon have listed five power saving devices on their web pages.  The extravagant claims for these devices are based on incomplete knowledge of anything to do with electrical power consumption measurements.. Save 50-75% on your Energy Bill  what utter utter frauds.  Amazon of course  don't make only sell them as a drop shop.  M E Denton Lincoln UK,1
"amazon shopping quality went down, amazon customer service quality went down, prices are not cheaper then others anymore, many times bought on Walmart, HomeDepot as it was cheaper.Amazon prime in no longer worth it - 8 out of last 10 orders were delivered well past indicated at shopping delivery date. I have cancelled prime.",0
Never had any problems getting my products + they are very cheap and arrive very fast,2
Great delivery and return policy.,2
"Bought 500 .22 pellet from ""Amazon"" not a seller for $6.24. They then mark my order as undeliverable, cancelled my order, refunded me maybe( I haven't received it yet) and said I could reorder. GREAT except the price is now more than doubled at $12.99. this is a scam as far as I am concerned. I believe when companies like Crosman raises there prices Amazon cancels any item not shipped due to some magic error, so they can get the higher commission on it. I have seen this with private seller alot were an item was won at auction and the seller thinks the price was too low so magically ""it was sold in our store""",0
Reason f o r one star is far from friendly an not good at solving issues orders are never on time I would not recommend this place to any one an they don't respond back to you an if they do it's not on time .,0

"This installment of Total Gut Makeover, featuring IBS is an essential guide for those suffering from IBS. For years I have battled with symptoms and flare-ups that I was unsure how to handle and left with some misguided medical information. Although I am still learning, the recipes included within this book have improved my day-to-day life significantly by making only minor changes. What I was looking for the most with this recipe book were some simple meal ideas that I could prepare ahead of time and easily take to work for lunch. Meal planning can be overwhelming, but this guide has a 21-day meal plan that is easily repetitive and enjoyable, while also including some meals that are easy to prepare in advance. I'm already seeing an improvement in my levels of fatigue from only a week of implementing these new meals into my routine. For now, I'm not strictly going by the guide, but more so interjecting these meals into my otherwise normal routine. The summer tomatoes and gluten free berry muffins are top favorites for me!",2
"Hello I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years.The best company to order online In my opinion. The service is excellent comparing to any other websites.No matter what issue I had with the goods or with the shipment , Amazon customer service always made the best decision.

"I placed an order, Amazon provided the wrong tracking number, or the seller provided the wrong tracking number to them. It was delivered to another state, and I know it was not my item because it was described by USPS as a small packet item delivered to mailbox, my item was a treadmill which would not be a small packet that could be delivered in a mailbox.I tried contacting the seller and with no success. I looked for a way to contact Amazon to tell them that contrary to showing the item was delivered, it was not delivered and that I was getting no satisfaction from the seller, I looked everywhere on Amazon, there is NO customer service to contact for such issues - nothing at all. I finally had to contact the bank to dispute the charge because there was no way for me to get any assistance from Amazon.",0
"Can't fault Amazon for their super fast delivery and excellent customer service. Always kept up to date via email too. Bought hundreds of stuff in the last 2 years...and I often leave a feedback.

"Awful - Nb this is about Amazon export sales LLC: ordered from them, package arrived safely in UK. Delivery screwed up by useless UK courier, Hermes. Hermes say you can contact the seller directly who will raise delivery issues with them. Just try contacting Amazon, a pathetic joke.

Placed order & paid for next day delivery. Arrived on time (I.e. next day).Under the present circumstances very good service.,2
I absolutely love Amazon prime the addition of movies  and next day delivery on thousands of products is incredible sometimes I would sooner wait for the delivery man to arrive the next morning or afternoon than queue in a store. its the future of shopping,2

Amazon has its fine points, but overall it really lost its ""Touch""....don't get me started with Amazon Prime Shopping support....it started out strong....but now....it is just plain crap!!!! Expired, rotten, thawed, broken, and open items...are just the norm now....sad! I do not see a benefit Paying for Prime anymore....",1
"Honestly, noo too average no too decent, is fine",1
Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty decent but they really do need to sort out their third party order  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1
One stop shop where I can get anything I need with a tap of a mouse. And if I'm having trouble making a decision on purchase the reviews are always spot on.,2
Normally very decent but the last 2 orders have not gone well one never arrived and other came damaged managed to get they swapped but it took allot of emails and hassle might shop local going forward,1

"Amazon has been pretty helpful for most occasions. Sometimes their third world customer service associates have difficulty understand what I am trying to explain in email, but they do try their best to guide me on what I need to do.

An huge variety,2
Received a text message notifying that the driver tried calling us requesting for a safe place to hand over the parcel – despite the fact that we are currently in the house. There was no attempt to ring the door bell or knock on the door.

I just tried to review a product and suggested that perhaps some of the other reviews might not be real as none of the many thousands mentioned the obvious problem I wished to point out.

"You shop on Amazon.  You find what you want.  One of the reasons you shop here is because of their shipping.  You place your order because Amazon promises your package will be delivered on a certain day.  Then you wait because your package doesn't come.

"I have never had any problems with Amazon.  I have rarely had to return any items and when I have, the process has always been quick and painless. Most recently, however, they have sent me a book with about 30 pages stuck together. Instead of them sending me a replacement (which is usually what happens when I go through the return process), they have asked me to send this item back for a refund.  I ordered the book in the Black Friday sale at about £2.79.  The book has now gone up up £7.99.  There is no way I would pay full price for the book so I am now a Christmas present short.  I wish they would have just replaced it as it was their fault for sending a faulty product to start with.",2

Unfortunately the shipment person did not put the item in my mailbox but put it sticking out under the doormat, It would have fit in the mailbox but the lid on the box would not be able to close. that is not a problem. The post office routinely puts letters and packages in the box even though the box lid does not close. I would have preferred the item be put in the box and not partially under the mat. I did see the package but had i not been paying attention I would have stepped on it. Please put my packages in the mailbox. Thank you.",1

"Amazon Customer service was helping my sort out a subscription issue.  They mirrored my fire 7 screen to help navigate the issue.  The problem I have with that was that the customer service representative insisted that I log in to the subscription's website, use my amazon uid/pwd to log in to the subcription's app.  Ok - But... the screen mirroring was on and she wanted me to  check the box to show the password!  TO MY AMAZON ACCOUNT!  I just kept messing up my password until she got impatient & got off the phone call and mirror of my fire 7 tablet.  Then I went out and fixed the issue myself.  Poor practice on Amazon Customer Service's part by wanting a person to put in their password WHILE MIRRORING IS ON.  And insisting that I check the box to show my password.  Suspicious...",0

"Amazon says there was a billing issue with my account. I have called them multiple time and emailed them multiple times to address this issue but they are playing pass the buck game.

I'm trying really hard to be fare but the more mess ups the harder it gets. Delivery of goodss have become hit or miss. The quality has been fairly fine when I do get them. My main issue is the refund process for items that I dont get delivered. It is time consuming and they are extremely picky on the way you reply. I should not have to jump through loops to get my money back. I really wish they would make it mandatory for drivers to take a pic of every order left. There needs to be a better way for drivers to confirm order address or they need to stop being lazy and actually pay attention to what address they are at.,1
"I had an account with Amazon for a while, but didn't use it very often. I was able to shop in December and later during the holiday season I received an email that my account was blocked and I need to confirm it within 24 hours. There was no explanation as to why this is happening etc. On December 26th, I was sitting with my family not checking my email!s Today on January 8th I tried to buy something again, but couldn't. When I called for help, they couldn't enter my post code so they were not able to check what was wrong. I ended up having my account blocked for a reason that was not given to me and the help center was unable to help. No other platform has put me off as much as Amazon. If you don't want me as your customer I will go somewhere else.",0
"Good prices, quick shipment (via prime) and excellent customer support mean that I now buy most things through Amazon. They have removed the stress and risks of buying fines for me and I now receive a few parcels a week from them. In the rare cases when there are issues contacting customer support quickly resolves them.Update from my original 5 star review. Amazon have become more aggressive as they seek to monetise their high market share. Alexa continually tries to sell you more supports (you cannot stop this) to the point of ruining the user usage and has today signed me up for an audible subscription it offered my six year old and she declined  (Alexa has the recording DON’T sign me up).Customer support now don’t offer email and the chat use literally two hours of life I’ll never get back refusing to acknowledge the issue or allow me to raise a complaint. I used to be a a loyal customer who trusted Amazon to treat me with respect but increasingly feel more just a Pound sign in their eyes",1
Deliveries are amazingly extremely slow. I live 5 minutes from there location in my town and yet I have to wait all day long for a package and most of the time it’s delivered to the wrong address. So I decided to have package delivered at a hub station close to my house keep them from delivering it at the wrong house as always and still got to wait all day long WOW Unbelievable,0

"You cannot complain to this awful company. When they tell you something and you disagree, they will hang up on you, and definitely do not raise your voice. If you do, they will hang up. They always deliver to the wrong address. One time, I realized that they delivered my underwear to the lady across the street, and I got the hair coloring. The delivery idiot had just left, so I called their English free representative. I told her they had just left, and that he had to be right down the street and they should get them to come back, but noooooo, they told me I had to wait and file a claim.",0
"Pathetic AmazonI ordered L'Oreal Professionnel Serie Expert Liss Unlimited Evening Primrose Oil, 125ml and De Fabulous Shampoo, 250ml and Conditioner Reviver Set, 250ml on 05/09/2018 and both delivered to me on 06/09/2018 through Amazon Prime Delivery.When I opened the packet, I found that the bottles were not properly packed (sellotaped here and there) and there was leakage also. Oil was coming out of bottle. In fact it seems that these bottles were packed by someone from Amazon after getting them returned by any other customer. In my opinion I had been delivered product already used/returned by someone else.I had clearly read the policy regarding return/refund at the time of placing the order and I knew that product was not eligible for return/refund but I was not sure that I would be delivered such kind of already used/returned by some else product. I needed these product on urgent basis therefore I decided to get them delivered through Amazon Prime delivery and I paid extra money for that but what I got? Already used products… I never expected it from Amazon.I have paid my hard earned money to Amazon for these products and now I got defective products. I sent an e-mail to Amazon mentioning the issues I faced and attached pictures of the same. Next day I got an e-mail that ""on verification it was found that the products were damaged therefore refund would be issued"" and I was asked to update my account details, I updated my account details and on the very next day I was informed that the refund could not be issued as pictures are not clear.I sent pictures and numerous e-mails again and again but all in vain. I tried to contact customer care but my number was blocked. I tried chat option and they informed me that after examining pictures they haven't found any damage in the products. Amazon already examined the pictures and accepted that the products were damaged and on re-examining Amazon found these products good..what a joke..Amazon making fool out of me. It is requested everyone not to shop from Amazon as it is a fraud company. Pathetic customer care service.I am from hospitality background myslf...this kind of customer services I or any of my friends have never offered to anyone ..you should be ashamed of being serving customers like the way you are..Highly appalled..I will never recommend Amazon to anyone.",0

I’m so very pleased with my Amazon order!I ordered fresh Gluten Free pasta.  I ordered GF tortellini stuffed with 4 different cheeses.It arrived packed in dry ice and arrived in 3 days of my purchase date.  We had an Italian meal last weekend with the pasta and my family LOVED IT!!!  They couldn’t tell it was GF Pasta at all.  I will definitely order more fresh pasta from Amazon.  I would have gave them 5 stars but GF prices are high.,2
"Constant delay in delivering items, missing items and damaged goods. All the customer service what to say is they are sorry but that does not help. Just had a failed delivery two days in a row but not to a home address it was to a Amazon locker so how can this be ? The customer service were not interested and told be just to wait and I will get my item soon. I found this quite insulting. I also pay for prime and asked for a months refund and the person laughed at me and said that’s not what we do.",0
"I cannot believe this actually happened and I do not believe it was done by mistake. Instead of the meta quest 3 we received 2 boxes of cat food. I was given pass code to driver which kind of gives it away that it's an expensive product, so I don't know if the driver is the culprit. Straight away tried to contact amazon through the app which was not easy, after explaining the situation to a representative on the chat he said this time ups will collect the return and I will be refunded within 14 days. Not sure what to make of that! I had to reorder as its a birthday gift for my son. Again I received email that a pass code is required. I am now very worried same thing may happen. I will be recording once I hear a knock on the door and make the driver witness what's in the parcel this time. Wonder if anyone else has experienced anything like this",0

"Absolutely disgusted with Amazon, yesterday I placed an order through Amazon which I have done many times before, today I see a notice on Amazon (no email sent to me) that the card I used didn't go through and so they have charged to another card on my account (which is my work credit card) with no authorisation from me, this card was not linked as a default card.  This has now caused an issue with my employer as I only have this card for work related purchases. I am also quite sure that unless I agree that a card can be used as a default card then automatic payments cannot be made.",0
"I used to love Amazon and it used it almost daily to purchase items. I am a prime member but I find most prime items are more expensive. I dislike the ""add on"" only set up of items. I don't like the fact I have to pay separate subscriptions for each Alexa/echo  I have in my home. My deliveries always turn up on time and on the rare occasion I have had to return something it has always gone incredibly smoothly although I have read they will ban customers who return too many items which is slightly off putting. I like Amazon but just don't use it as much anymore as it is no longer competitive with its prices and I don't like feeling ""had"" with hidden fees. I won't be renewing my prime membership.",1
"From my experience, it looks like Amazon is sneakily supporting BDS.My shipping address in an Israeli city in Samaria has started triggering an automatic reply ""does not ship to Israel"". Just on a hunch, I changed to an alternate address in the Tel Aviv coastal area, and instantly I saw that the same item DOES ""ship to Israel"". That's already bad enough. But when I tried to order the item, the order kept getting confirmed and then cancelled after 24 hours (5x). Among other excuses, Amazon support told me my bank kept refusing the payment request - my bank told me they never got any request. Finally Amazon told me my account is ""very sensitive"" -- SO sensitive they can't even tell me what's wrong with it by email, ""for security reason [sic]"". Then they stopped talking to me.I'm betting what's so ""very sensitive"" is my billing address, still in that city in Samaria. And the ""security reason"" is that if word gets out that they are discriminating against Israeli customers based on political bias, they will be liable under American anti-BDS laws.That very same week, Amazon was publicizing its new selling hub for Israelis. Talk about two-faced!BTW I had a similar experience last year with Amazon UK. Their 'customer care' people also gave me bogus excuses, and they also stopped answering my emails.All Israelis should think twice about partnering with, or buying from, Amazon.",0

"Amazon as a company has decided to limit free speech and free enterprise by limiting conservative apps from operating.

I respectfully say thank you for your great customer service representatives. 5 stars indeed.",2
"I ordered an Amazon Fire stick. It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an order confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the order status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new order date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer assistance and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the acceptables never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too. Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund usage. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.",1
They advertise prime as having fast shipping yet I have waited over two weeks for my skincare kit. It clearly stated free two-day shipping on their site if you are a prime member. I was in a rush to get this item and I decided to spend  the money to become a Prime member and get the item quickly and it still isn't here two weeks later. ,1
"I use amazon a lot, especially around the holidays. My husband has prime shipping, so most items arrive within 2 to 3 days. I have had some problems with some returns--not getting a full refund on goodss on I returned because of the seller's policy. I had some difficulties with a merchant this Christmas, but the merchant handled the problem to my satisfaction. You just have to be careful that the merchant does not charge a restocking or return fee, especially if the mistake was the merchant's fault. My husband ordered an item from a seller on amazon and it was defective. When he contacted the company, they sent him a return address label but it was not prepaid, so we had to pay the shipping fee to return it. I told him he should have refused to pay for return shipping since the item was defective, and he needs to mention that in his review of the seller. Overall, though, I have had mostly positive interactions with amazon and will continue to use them. You can find almost any type of item on amazon, which makes shopping with them very convenient.",1

"I use Amazon a lot and am generally very happy with the service I receive. However I'm only giving 4 stars, rather than 5 as on the one occasion I had an issue with an order, Amazon Customer Services were very slow to respond - in fact, they refunded me without telling me that they had, leaving me to keep contacting them! Overall though, I would say that 1 problem when I've placed over 100 orders tells its own story. I will continue to use them - keep up the good work!",2
So I ordered a bunch of stuff and I waited for days for the delivery. I called them and asked them where is my order and they said it was delivered? I didn’t receive anything and it was a bulky order so I was confused how it can be lost or stolen? I asked the customer service man to contact the driver and he said they can’t do that. A massive company like that? So I requested a refund because I didn’t receive my items. I got the refund and today I receive a pathetic email from the ofc specialist team saying that they may close my account because deliveries don’t go missing like that blah blah. I’m confused exactly what are they accusing me off? I’m not a thief and I always pay my way but if my items were not delivered I have every right to a refund. And then ti get this stupid email has really pissed me off. I have been a loyal customer to them for years no more. Disgusting service from a huge company like Amazon!,0

"I am writing this review to share a recent experience with Amazon that has left me deeply disappointed and concerned. After purchasing a Panasonic camera, I discovered that it was missing an essential component - the battery charger. This led me to contact Amazon's customer service, where I expected a simple and straightforward resolution. However, what transpired was far from satisfactory.My interaction with a customer service manager named Cris, based in the Philippines, was not only unhelpful but also deeply troubling. Cris's approach to handling my concern was evasive and unprofessional. The situation escalated to a point where, following my expressed dissatisfaction, I received a notification about ""abnormal activity"" on my account, which I believe was a retaliatory action.This experience has raised serious concerns about the misuse of power within Amazon's customer service. The treatment I received was not just poor service; it bordered on tactics I would associate with organized crime - using intimidation and authority to suppress and control. As a customer of over 18 years, I am shocked and appalled.I believe such behavior within Amazon's ranks is unacceptable and poses a significant risk to customer trust and loyalty. I urge Amazon to address this issue seriously and take necessary steps to ensure that no other customer experiences such treatment. Until then, my confidence in Amazon and my decision to continue as a customer remains uncertain.",0
"in general they do pretty well.   god help you if you want to leave feedback about them or their site.    their annoying gdamned app will message me all day long every few minutes about deals or hey do you wanna buy, or an order that I placed is going through step 500 of the 1000 things they'll tell me about, but they can't be bothered to tell me when/why an order I was looking for was cancelled or otherwise marked 'undeliverable'.   and trying to be able to talk to a person about this issue, or let them know that I think this is a problem?   I may as well pee into the wind and call it a hot shower, cuz ...  newp!   'customer support' means I get to do it myself through their website.it might be time for me to reconsider if I really want to  order anything from them again.",1

I had returned a couple of items and had the balance refunded to my Amazon account because Amazon stated the money will be there within hours. Cool. Amazon also stated same day delivery. Cool. I needed cat treats that same day and Amazon promised same day. However, once they get your payment, they changed the dates! It’s gone from same day delivery to 3 days later! I will never refund to my Amazon account again and I don’t plan to shop at Amazon half as much.",0
Review sites should start giving us the opportunity to leave negative star reviews. I bought a set of frangrances from one of their sellers. They turned out to be fake. They must have bought the real versions split them and mixed them with water. The company changed it’s name the minute I placed the order. Insane!! Amazon says I can’t leave a review exposing them. WHATEVER!! Then I’ll leave one exposing them! On numerous review sites!!,0
"I've been ordering from Amazon since October 2016. I got to know of them when I stayed in the US for a couple of months for technical and hands-on training. I've experienced delays, items lost or damaged or even ""delivered"" but no one knocked and I was home the whole day. On the other hand, I've also experienced extra-early deliveries, being given freebies, and all that.In my years of online shopping, I've also bought from competitor platforms like Lazada, eBay, to name a few. I still buy from other platforms but what keeps me with Amazon is how I find their customer service to be. The quality is exactly what you would expect of an American company: customer-satisfaction-centered.Your experience may differ, but I can see myself ordering from Amazon for years to come simply because if they do it right, I am one happy customer; and if something is wrong, their customer service whether chat or call will get my problem resolved each time.",2

"I use Amazon a lot.  Every month I'm ordering stuff, usually more than once.  Products I order usually get to my apartment fairly fast, and I usually get free shipping by spending over $25 at a time.  But their Web pages could be designed a lot better.  Sometimes important information is hard to find, or completely missing.  Sometimes one Web page is for several different items, but the reviews for these different items are all mixed together.",1
"Many people to talk to, but no one who can really help your issue. They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a average mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",1

"Once great, this online marketplace has been destroyed by inaccurate listings, reviews for the wrong products which grossly skew overall product ratings, and most importantly - search algorithms that push products that often have absolutely NOTHING to do with what is entered in the search bar. In fact, in many cases it is possible to type EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BY BRAND AND MODEL NAME and get results that are often completely different and unrelated products or at the very least poor quality imitations of what you asked for with hundreds or even thousands of incorrect and misleading reviews for other products. Shame on them. Seems nobody is monitoring or moderating reviews, listings, or descriptions any more. Too bad. Time to move onto different retailers at this point.",0
Amazon make it VERY difficult to get free order when you spend over £20. It used to be automatically applied. Now you have to get past the constant flogging of Amazon prime go through the order option and select free order. Not only must you spend a whopping 20 quid you have to avoid getting mugged at the check out for free order. How many BILLIONS do this lot need.,1
"The first thing I should say about Amazon is that if you want a cheaper price for something that you want, then you should check here first. The next thing is that you can get free shipping on almost anything if you qualify for it (which is easy to do) They have everything and anything on the site. I would recommend this site to anyone and everyone!",2

"I've been using my Son's Prime account for 5+ years & now need to use my own account.I'm at my wits end after several calls to Customer Service which seems to be someone in a foreign country each time.After I enter my email address in the box, Amazon sends me a numeric code that I successfully enter in a box.  The problem begins here; Amazon asks me for the expiration date of an old credit card that I haven't used in years because it was compromised & closed.No matter how many times I enter my email  & enter their security code, authenticate my address...the program always asks the same question...""what is the expiration date of an expired credit card""!I want my account restored using my email.  The suggestions from support were ""get a new email or use my phone number instead"".  I run my life using a central email & don't want non urgent texts coming to my phone & I certainly don't want Amazon telling me to change my phone number should another issue arise were I to use my phone number.I know Amazon has sophisticated business on the corporate side, but the retail side must know a credit card expiration date to an old expired card?I authenticated all other information correctly.  So my account exists, but is not accessible by anyone?",1
my order came a week earlier than expected and the tracking works extremely well all over amazon is great to use and would recommend.,2
They’ve gotten difficult over the years.  I recently had items in my cart and called prior to ordering and the second rep (Amazon Locker Specialist) explained the items weren’t eligible for Amazon Locker and why but to go ahead with shipment to a UPS Store and they’d make an exception and reimburse the per package fee.  I received the three packages today and called for the $15.  The first agent insisted after I explained it all again there was “no record” like I’d made it up.  I think their game is for the consumer to give up. He transferred me to a supervisor who also made me explain it before mentioning they “have a recording of the conversation” and she credited $15.,1
Always easy to use this site,2
"I am gobsmacked by these people. I cannot understand the arrant stupidity of not following the delivery instructions and just leaving an electrical item outside, well away, 20 yards,from the front door, in the middle of winter when rain is highly likely.I was in, the item could have been dropped and the doorbell rung....and then there is absolutely nowhere to complain to. I will have to review my future use of this firm following this experience",0
"offers lots of choices of the seller, but even good reviews did not always reflect the actual product that I received",2
I am beyond disgusted with Amazon. For months now they have been taking money from my account for a prime account I do not have. I have tried multiple times to call amazon up and it is a wrong number. Ince the numerous emails I was sending were answered and then the next email I received was to say they are not replying to email due to Covid! This is the third time this year I have been charged for services I am not using with. First it was being charged for two amazon prime accounts when I only had one... since cancelling they are charging me for one account even though I am not a member. Audible- (amazon company) was also charging me for an account I didn’t have. The fact that it is near impossible to get in touch with them makes the whole experience incredibly distressing. They are thieves.,0
"Amazon have yet to refund me £160 which they say my bank has, when asked the bank they don't hold money they refund it straight away but amazon seem to think it takes 3to 5 working day depending who you speck to and others say 10 working day, so please be advised when buy from amazon they will not refund you if an item is pressed my mistake or faulty, please don't make my mistake haha happy shopping people or find an alternative",0
"Amazon charges for Prime service, then offers 2 and 3 day shipping as a benefit for your paying more that $100 annually for it.  However, they reserve the right to break this agreement when it suits them. If for whatever reason they can't get your item to you within the time stated (even though it's listed as a prime item) the excuses from customer service vary from ""The item wasn't in one of our depots"" to ""This item has been delayed and hasn't reached your local facility"" or just plain lies promising the delivery will make it the next day. So don't count on, or expect an item to be delivered when promised. And don't expect to be treated like a ""Prime"" customer when you call for answers. Their customer service supervisors will be rude when they feel like it, and just hang up on you if they want and apparently there's no path of escalation for this behavior. I've canceled all of my recurring subscriptions and will cancel my Prime membership before it renews. Amazon is very convenient, but it's not worth the frustration, stress and rude treatment I've received from their customer service team.",0
Never ever really had issues with Amazon.Always deliver the correct items in excellent condition and always on time,2
Never had a problem with these guys & always reliable!,2
"One of the best online store I have used, its a very user friendly platform and I love using them anytime I need to buy something online.",2
Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.,1
Excellent thanks for letting,1
"We literally could not live without them, they have turned shopping from a chore into a fun experience and let us do it all from home. Almost every product on prime arrives exactly when it’s supposed to and any that do not are not the fault of Amazon. Selection is amazing, I think a more identified mark should be listed for 3rd party sellers like the mark for prime, most third party stores are top notch but I’ve seen some scams out there and when I tried to report them it fail’s sometimes. If you stick with Amazon stuff and not blame them for the delivery company issues you will have no problems ever. I cannot for the life of me understand why the overall rating isn’t close to 5 stars",2
"My moan is about the order assistance provided by their Enfield (North London) Delivery Depot.Amazon Tracking states that packages leave their depot around NOON, yes noon.Most of my orders are delivered to my local 'locker' which happens to be within a Post Office which, on a Saturday, closes at 3 pm!!!!! Should I have a order to home the drivers have a tendency to tap on the glass in and surrounding the front door (which rarely I can hear), why I have no idea because there are TWO working doorbells which would be impossible to miss.",1
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1

"I ordered medicine for my cat and needed it that day.  According to the site, it would be delivered the same day I ordered and I paid an additional $10 for this delivery date.  I received an email from Amazon stating that it would NOT be delivered for three days.  When I contacted Amazon (don't bother - no one speaks English nor do they understand the language), I was informed pretty much too sad, too bad.  I told him I wanted the order cancelled and I wanted a refund.  He stated I would NOT be receiving a refund.  I will NEVER order from these criminals again.",0
I was supposed to receive 3 parcels today one of which was a birthday present non of them arrived even though it states that they had been posted through my letter box tried to chat with chat box who advised me that they have completed delivery information and they have not been delivered and to re contact them if I do not receive them by the 22/11/23 this is not the first experience of not receiving my parcels and it is not acceptable,0
Nothing that i deslike - satisfied with prime,1
Excellent services All other company’s should use amazon as a example on how to deliver on service Excellent on price of goods and customer service,2
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the items supplied. It's Amazons own order support that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1
"Wow, what a great experience I had with you guys! I ordered a Boltune Bluetooth Earphones V5.0 and am so impressed with the fast shipping, the product itself and the gift card worth 20 USD that came with it. It was so nice to see such a personalized touch. I'll be sure to tell my kite surf friends about my online shopping experience. Keep up the good work. I will definitely buy from you again.",2
"Honestly, I had purchased on Amazon before and I never had problems with any of my orders. But recently, I decided to purchase shoes on Amazon and I had the most stressful experience. When I ordered my shoes, I kept tracking it and everything was going well and I liked how Amazon always tells you when your shipment will arrive. On the day my shipment was suppose to arrive, i checked my tracking information and it said it was being sent back to seller with no explanation. When I reached out to the seller he explained to me he didn't know why either and that id receive a refud. I was very annoyed and confused but I gave amazon another chance because like I said before, I have had good experiences with Amazon. So I decided to just purchase the same shoes from another seller on Amazon and when I did everything was going well until on the day the shipment was suppose to arrive AGAIN. On this day, I logged on to check my tracking info and it said UPS was unable to deliver my package. I contacted an Amazon Agent and they told me that my address was incomplete and I needed to contact UPS to complete it. Mind you my product was delivered and at a UPS near me. When I contacted UPS to complete my address they told me that it was a huge change of address if I completed it,So UPS told me to contact Amazon to complete the address. when I spoke to another Amazon Agent they said they couldn't complete my address either because the carrier had the product. At this point I'm calling UPS and Amazon back and forth to complete my address and no one can do it. Finally UPS told me I could pick it up at the UPS ware house but I needed an ID. And I couldn't pick it up because I always use a Nickname online shopping. If Amazon could have told me my address was incomplete as soon as I purchased my product, I would not have gone through all of this. That was the most stressful online experience I've ever had at that point I just canceled my order.",0
"I won't use Amazon.ca until they stop using Purolator.They lost another one of my packages after waiting for 1 month.Oh and guess what, the item is no longer in stock.",1
the customer reviews and ratings are very useful.,2
"Happy with the purchase I made but I don't like the offer and stuff of amazon prime, i don't like the idea.",1
"BOYCOTT AMAZONI have used Amazon for twenty years or more, and buy hundreds of items from them every year. Last week I had an insolent message from a so-called Account Specialist who claimed: ""We noticed that you have requested multiple returns in the last few months, and some of the items that you have returned were damaged, used, or not in their original condition."" That was a pack of lies. I wrote back, pointing out that I have never returned anything unless there was something wrong with it, and that nothing had ever been damaged or been used. This waste-of-space (who has never signed his name) then copied his first message without answering my email. I then complained first to the Manager, then to HIS boss, and I sent copies to Jeff Bezos which always did the trick. The waste-of-space pulled the same stunt four times - never replied, and simply copied his first message again and again. I have now demanded that my complaint be escalated and until it is resolved, I will not buy anything through these misfits.",0
Amazon is easy to use. I love the convenience. Their app runs smoothly. I can find what I need.,2
"I've rarely had issues with Amazon prior to this, but I have cancelled my prime membership and closing out my Amazon credit card account and I will NEVER use Amazon again. After realizing I needed a cable to connect to a conference at 10am the next morning, I purchased this item specifically because it had next morning delivery, even adding two other items I did not need to be above the $25 threshold for the 4am-8am delivery. I woke up at 6 because I didn't want the package sitting out front after sunrise only to find the item hadn't shipped yet. After waiting until 9am, only because the order had changed to 'preparing to ship' before I raced to Walmart and purchased the item. Later, the order delivery time changed to between 5pm & 10pm, so I used the Amazon assistant to cancel the order, but received a message saying that it might be too late to cancel. Shortly after I got an email saying it was too late to cancel. I then used the messaging system and after initially being told the same thing by 2 employees, I was put in touch with a supervisor who told me he contacted the warehouse to cancel order. A short time later I saw that the item now showed 'shipped' but still had delivery window of 5p to 10pm. This time I requested a call back, and after wasting approximately 45 minutes trying to explain that because it had not arrived in the promised timeframe, I was forced to purchase it already and since I had only purchased it because of early morning delivery, even adding items I did not need to be eligible, asking for order to be cancelled was not an unreasonable request. The two employees and 'supervisor' I spoke with were not helpful and even rude, telling me the item had shipped (but wouldn't arrive for another 5-9 hours), they could not cancel order. I know for a fact that they can contact drivers because of a previous missed delivery where they contacted driver to complete delivery the same night. But all attempts to cancel this order were denied, telling me I would either have to track the order and be out front when truck arrived to refuse delivery or waste my time to return item. The order was delivered at 7pm, I tried tracking, checking about every 5 minutes, but somehow after seeing 6 deliveries before mine, when I next checked back it showed delivered. I was not asking for anything outrageous, they failed to meet the promised delivery window, which is THE ONLY REASON I MADE PURCHASE, even adding two items for my dog in order to get order above $25, this shouldn't have been an issue. I'm finished with Amazon, if they fail to respect or appreciate their customers, I will take my business elsewhere.",0
"I purchased an OtterBox defender phone case on December 11 and the color was wrong so I returned it, been waiting for weeks for some kind of word on my $38 and when I call amazon iam told that they refunded a completely different card, not the one used to purchase this item but one from over a year ago Nov 2018 to be exact that I had purchased an OtterBox on over a year ago! When I pointed this out that it was a different card that was used to purchase this , Amazon didn’t seem concerned about it and said that I should try to contact the card issuer to find my money! I don’t even know what card it was ? I wasn’t given the last 4 of it or anything! I was so shocked I asked for the transcript so I could read it again. Customer service is non existent at this so called American Company! Nor do they employ anyone American at thier customer service.",0
Customer service very poor.I do not recommend shopping on this site .It's best not to do any business with this company....Search the internet it's best to buy straight from the producers.,0
Has everything you could need and always at a competitive price. I buy everything on amazon...,2
I bought a Product on Amazon which doesn’t work. I have initiated a return but neither the seller nor amazon customer service are returning my emails. I also wrote a review on the bad customer customer service on amazon which amazon refuses to to make public in their website. What about transparency for other customers? Both good and poor experiences shall be shared with the public.,0
"Pricing may not always be the best, but it's competitive. Goods selection is stellar. Deliveries are on time 99% of the time. Customer service is outstanding.  They always resolve in my favor and are willing to spend as much time as it takes. They definitely go the extra mile.",2
I'm trying really hard to be fare but the more mess ups the harder it gets. Delivery of items have become hit or miss. The quality has been fairly fine when I do get them. My main issue is the refund process for items that I dont get delivered. It is time consuming and they are extremely picky on the way you reply. I should not have to jump through loops to get my money back. I really wish they would make it mandatory for drivers to take a pic of every order left. There needs to be a better way for drivers to confirm order address or they need to stop being lazy and actually pay attention to what address they are at.,1
I wanted to know where my order was and the customer service helped with this.,2
Usually the service is excellent and very quick. On the few occasions where there has been a problem Amazon have been quick to sort it out.,2
Cheap & always quick delivery. Can always find what I am looking for,2
"I will leave Amazon.  They have a curated profile of who they want as customers and the tiers are quite obvious.  Their shipping system is dismal and random.   For so many people, Amazon simply cannot be bothered. The region they live in is not desirable to Amazon's accountants.  Profit is the ONLY motivation of Amazon. They shift all responsibility to the shipper, whose name they pull out of a hat.  Countless people that do not live in or near urban regions cannot reliably use Amazon.  I get endless refunds because my items never arrive.  Looking to join the obviously required class-action.",0
I find amazon is no longer as great when it first started blooming. Packages don't arrive at all or don't arrive withing the prime time. Just no longer a big fan.,1
I love the fact that I can buy anything on Amazon!  They have helped me when a company sent me an inferior product that I bought through them and have allowed me to sell my own products.,2
"Though ordering and paying was easy, the shipment part was not so fine. I ordered a book and it took almost 2 months to arrive.",1
Constantly requested reshipment of my item and my request was ignored time and time again. My mop arrived 6 days later than planned. Once it came I was very happy with it though so worth the wait.,1
"I've had an issue with Amazon double charging previously, and their response was far from swift. I ended up relying on my bank to refund me the amount due to Amazon failing to accept responsibility, and putting the phone down on me after hours of phone calls trying to beg for them to refund me.I now attempted to verify myself for Student Prime, however, my email was not accepted by Amazon's automated system. I sent manual verification, to be told my card wasn't saved to my account (it was). Afterwards, I was asked to resend my details which went back and forward around 3 times until I had to call them to chase it up as I needed a product urgently for an exam on Friday. Unfortunately, nobody was able to assist and my details were passed around everywhere. I've only since started receiving scam emails claiming to be from 'Apple ID' and 'Amazon Pride' which have been sent to the hide my email for Amazon. After reporting this data breach, they have done nothing about it, refused to accept responsibility and again put the phone down, while my order is still half processed. I also received an email saying someone had unauthorised access to my account and to call Customer Service, who can't do anything.I'd never trust Amazon with my details and will close my account as soon as I've received my order. Disgusting treatment of customers and don't deserve a single penny!",0
I know people who work at their warehouse and they love their jobi also use amazon a lot and can’t complain. Even when they things go wrong its always solved asap,2
"If I have a choice, I ALWAYS shop Amazon!!!!",2
I will never use Amazon again ever. Tortured me with paperwork to reclaim Vat then didn't even supply a Vat invoice. They don't comply with EU law. Never again. I'll make an effort not to buy any of their products,0
I have had great experiences with them for nearly a decade. My only complaint is that I wish they would pay their workers better wages.,2
"I’ve used Amazon a lot without a problem ….until now. I thought I’d write this review to highlight a word of warning to other users on a particular issue….returns! I bought a large pack of cleaning sponges, the type that you use without a cleaning product (processed melamine sort) only to discover they are a cheap, flimsy copy of the usual ones and don’t do the job….upon trying them discovered they are not fit for purpose. Amazon had already deemed them an item that is ‘un-returnable’. You need to be aware that you could be stuck with an item you don’t want because it’s flawed or you changed your mind,  plus they won’t even comply with the distant selling rules. I’m very disappointed.",0
Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single order.,1
Never had a problem with these guys & always reliable!,2
"I order a lot on amazon. They usually ask for comments on items. I did a lot of comments on the items that I purchsed. I suddenly realised that I canot add comments on the quality os some that I recived and had to return them. I recall 3 times that I left comments amd truly said but Amazon send me a espouse that it canot be published. I wondered at the time of Amazon was trying to protect customers or the businesses that are selling on Amazon. Customers are allowed to leave comments that are honest and true, but Amazon filtering stops negative ones and this is not protecting the customers rights but businesses. If we the customers stop buying from Amazon, where would Amazon be.",1
Great place to search for items and see what's available but the website needs filters to help your search - such as price filters to make searching for items easier,1
What’s the point of paying for Prime and being told you will get next day delivery and you don’t! This has been happening to us for a while now. In future we will shop elsewhere!,0
"Fantastic service. I regularly purchase from Amazon. Delivery, customer service and returns are so convenient. Recently called to get some help with returns. As always the customer support lady was very helpful. keep it up.",2
"I always get what I expect from Amazon.  Quick delivery, good customer service and quality products.",2
I like this platform . It’s easy to use and it keeps you updated . The problem sometimes comes from shipment . Some shipment persons don’t follow instructions and leave packages unintended on the floor were all passbyers can take package and steal it . It started to happen more often .,1
i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early,2

"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great usage with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer support rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer support, is that if you ask a question about a goods because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer support reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
Amazing timing! Great customer service!,2
"I give Amazon a 3 out of 5 rating due to their affordable item range, which is a definite plus. However, they need to address the issues of incorrect deliveries and improve their reshipping process to provide a smoother customer interaction.",1
LOVE AMAZON!  Top notch company providing excellent customer service!,2
"Usually my amazon deliveries are great, but only when I deliver to my mother's home as they always put my parcel behind the wheelie bin if no one is home or just in general preferred space even if I'm home and they take a photo to let me know. However, when ordering, make sure to check what area you live in cause some areas are prone to either stealing your parcels if its small. I ordered 2 mascaras recently and it was suppose to come Thursday and suddenly I get a notification it's delivered today and left in the letterbox when it was not there at all, so disappointed, I'm never going to order to my apartament as my parcels are always never delivered, only if they're large parcels then they arrive as I'm shown tracking, and it arrives to me as I wait downstairs, also depends who delivers it, but when it comes to small packages it's always a problem, I'm awaiting a refund and re delivered same item to new address. Plus I didn't get a tracking map this time for this one  the shipment just flew out of nowhere, it kept saying delivering tomorrow then today and just switching up.",1
1. I singed up as a seller2. Amazon withdraw $49.99 from my CC3. I Can't list my items4. I contact Amazon and ask why. They say that Amazon no longer approve new sellers in my categoryWhy not let SELLERS know that BEFORE they sign up.Now they offer me a check as refund. They refuse to refund to CC. It would cost me over $15 to cash that check since i'm located outside of US.They are scammers!,0
"Prices are still acceptable but support going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer support and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"Once I went through everything you have to go through to speak with a real person, I spent over 2 hours with a very nice amazon rep and a few others who helped me fix the many, many reasons I wasn't able to log in to my own account. Email updates, phone not even receiving the code sent via text to enter in order to be able to edit my info. (Couldn't update my phone number to log in because they kept insisting I verify my old phone number through a text sent to the number I no longer have!)  Or the password not accepted because it's in use (because it's mine) even though it's current. Yes, it was both an adventure and a huge undertaking requiring a team of experts to cut through all the engineered obstacles in place to keep someone out. (Unfortunately that someone today was me.)  She was very nice and they all stuck with it and helped me. Very nice people once you can reach them.  😊",1
"Update, after a day of back and forth plus a trustpilot review I finally got a comprehensive answer and I am now have all the info and reasons why I cannot post my item review.  Maybe an explanation in the first place would have helped.                                                    I have written a review for an item I purchased. I was sent an email to say it was rejected. Fair enough. Why it was rejected is not noted so I looked at the guidelines and popped back on to right a review within these guidelines. Not allowed. Barred for writing a review because I really like something? Emailed the address given by Amazon for any questions regarding this. Reply states they cant find the review. Yes that would be correct Amazon- as you rejected it, the review wont be there. I replied and got another email stating I had emailed the wrong place and was given guidelines on how to report dodgy reviews. I have emailed again asking for someone to actually read my first email and let me review the item I purchased. Round and round we go, Will update if I ever get and answer to my initial request.......",1
"I don't get it.I ordered a valve for our shower.It came in and It didn't look right.I tried to install it but my trim kit didn't work with it, so I returned it.I got a refund, great.Then a while later Amazon sends me a message saying they rec'd an older valve and to return the correct valve or I would be charged for the valve.Really???  I sent them the exact thing they sent me.Been fighting them for months.  They just keep saying they want me to send back the correct valve.I've ordered, like most people a ton of stuff from Amazon and this is just unbelievable.Customer service?   I don't think so.I'm really pissed that I have to pay for some idiot that's decided they got something back other than what was sent to me.  Was it mispacked by the supplier?Was it returned by someone before me??Now I get stuck with paying for this?I mean it's a couple hundred bucks.  What if it was really expensive?  No way to get someone to listen.  You just get stuck with the bill.NOT HAPPY!!",0
"This review is split in two: - One for buying direct from Amazon (5* no question, best internet retailer by a mile) - One for buying from Amazon Market place (2* great until you have a problem) Amazon direct:What more is there to say about Amazon, when you order from them directly then it is flawless, any problems are taken away by their outstanding customer service team. They impress me every time. Amazon market place:Essentially one would expect that if you buy it via market place then since it goes through Amazon's engine and has their brand in front of it you'd think they would want to protect this and thus apply pressure to shoddy marketplace practices from some of the retailers. They don't. I bought some headphones, they broke after 3 months, so I requested a return from the company. Initially contact was good, then it all went quiet and I found myself contacting Amazon to request they gave them a bit of a nudge to play ball. Nothing. To cut a long story short, after several attempts with Amazon to get them to earn the cut of the sale that they put through their website I ended up going direct to the manufacturer. They told me that they didn't guarentee anything bought from the marketplace as there were a lot of fakes on there. I asked them to look at my phone anyway and tell me if they were fakes as I would have had far more to go back to Amazon with if they were and pointed out that they were in their first year of service and were guarenteed. Luckily they weren't fakes and they replaced them immediately, but Amazon's halo slipped dramatically for me as a result.  If you want your cut of the money Amazon then sometimes you have to do the dirty work too. If you steer clear of the marketplace then you will never go wrong with the mighty Amazon though.",2

Posted wrong review!,1
"Amazon prime temporarily locked my account out of the blue for no reason. And it keeps telling me to contact the support team, only problem is, when I try contacting the support team, it tells me to log in WITCH I CAN NOT DO!!! So I am completely stuck, and because they have no other way of reaching out to them, then call (which I will not do from Denmark). Sooooo I guess I have to tell my bank to block any payments to amazon prime. Edit: I ended up creating another acount with another email, and got through to live chat. The promised to resolve the issue within 48 hours, so lets wait and see if thet actually does help",0
"Amazon never fails! I’ve had numerous things ordered since this lockdown and can genuinely say Amazon have been outstanding during this pandemic, ensuring no matter the circumstances they still keep a quality service!",2
"Amazon is a great company with alot small problems, specially when it comes to vaguely answered customer assistance questions and those people have very limited power to help you with.And my most hated thing is the order status there should be more information and it should be more accurate.Other than that am happy with Amazon.",1
"Ordered 3 items last month and havent get it yet . Its been a month. 30 days. Talked to their cs everyweek . After 20 days,1 item has been shipped (says in the app but no email or whatsoever) and its been 10days i havent got it. Anything NADA!!. Yes i have been charge.. 3 CS said they can fix it coz it was only stuck in their warehouse. Then this guy, the last CS i talked to said he cant do anything about it. What a surprise",0
"Amazon's customer assistance has declined over the last years. Their 2 day shipping for prime members is great, but when there's an issue with an order their customer assistance lacks the support that they should be providing. ",1
"The packaging of Amazon is really good, but it's annoying to unpack. The 10000 tape packages are too much to unpack, but after we unpack, the quality of the package is impeccable.",2
"I absolutely agree with every single terrible review. The absolute worst customer service. They continuously transfer you to another rep because they don't want to get the bad survey whether you contacted them via phone or chat. The supervisors & managers are a joke as well. No one follows through, they lie constantly to YES get you off of the phone, & straight up don't give a fu**. Like I said the worst ever! NO COMMON SENSE! I would never treat my customers this way.*Maybe Amazon should stop getting cheap labor in other countries. They can do much better overall for their customers & afford better staff.",0
"They have EVERYTHING.  So, I just ask for Amazon GCs for birthdays and Christmas.  Every year I  build up a nice credit balance that I can use anytime.  Also, it can be good for all my friends & family, who are online, so it's easy to just send GCs for birthday gifts.  One-stop, all occasion solution.  I love the reviews; so helpful for making my shopping decisions.",2
"New to Amazon, So far so good. Their lockers are very close and items have been delivered very fast. Had a few delivers at home and all good so far. I do think some of their items are more costly than other places which shocked me, I thought Amazon was supposed to be cheaper. I stick to Amazon items, some of the delivery costs are a bit steep from other sellers. At the moment it grabbed me for convenience. Probably have a nightmare after leaving this review. Fingers crossed.Update, And so it begins, one order lost in space also was a bit shocked I received an email stating the order was delivered. I was sat in the lounge, driver didn't even ring bell. Thank god I was in. Anyone walking past would have seen parcel at the door. Hub locker or nothing In future.",2
"Been a customer to Amazon for years now and just getting fed up of all their cons. Happy to keep my account so the kids can use Alexa and my wife can read her kindle however I will not be shopping with them again. Extremely poor service. Very disappointed and disgusted at their recent service. Just the usual from a large company, think they can do what they want. Happy to give my money to other on line services.",0

"Amazon cancelled all my recent orders due to a ""security concern"" that they thought someone else had accessed my account - they did not, and these were orders I personally placed on Amazon, but their security system is too stupid to know the difference. Now I am struggling going back and forth between the BBB and the Amazon Executive Account Team.Get rid of your damn ""security"" system if it is stopping people from doing legitimate business on your website!Edit for Update: Amazon restored my order that was canceled. Rating increased because my order was restored to my account, but customer assistance was very unhelpful. 3 stars at most only because of the headache it caused me trying to get it fixed.",1

"Pretty wholistic service.  Online movies on demand, fast shipping, good return system.  My go to vendor for almost anything.  The non-amazon vendors on the amazon listings can be a little more sketchy.  Good stuff.",2
"Amazon is taking longer and longer to ship. When they finally do, they send your parcel (in N.B.) with Bonshaw. THE WORST DELIVERY COMPANY EVER!!! Have you read their reviews Amazon? NOT ONE is positive, the company is despised and yet you insist on using them and losing customers because of it. Prime membership is a joke, as is guaranteed delivery date. SO close to closing my account!!",0
Fairly decent assistance. My acceptables arrived some hours late but all were in excellent shape which was impressive.,1
"First agent hung up on me for cussing even though it wasnt directed at her. Second said the only option I had to was to report fraud to my bank since no one would help. Couldnt talk to a manager and everyone is outsourced to a country with a super thick accent. I would like to speak to someone whos first language is English and willing to tell me how to get the information to verify my account. Clearly I dont remember. But there has to be a way but all they kept saying is ""i understand how you feel"" no you dont you are useless",0
"Amazon Prime started out on a acceptable foot but the business continuity for order is NON-EXISTENT!  Almost every order (although thru prime) does NOT arrive at the time promise.  I pay for and use prime because it USED to have a speedy order.  I could wait almost to the 11th hour to order and get my goodss timely, THAT is a thing of the past!  I ordered $200 in items for an upcoming vacation and as I write this...it is 4 days until my vacation but my packages states that it is running late. The order times and dates perpetually change.  This is baffling to me because I made sure that ALL of my items was on Prime order so that I could get them before my vacation. I am NOT calling customer assistance again because I found out by an Amazon worker that they are only reading your order details from the same platform that we see our order.  So they are absolutely useless.  In compensation, they had out a measley $5 credit.  WTH is $5 on a $200 order???  It would be helpful for them to actually track the package up to calling the truck OR driver that has the package.  But I get the feeling that even if they did that, they would would be on the phone with the drivers ALL day, FURTHER delaying our goodss.  I want to cancel my membership and stop paying for Prime because an 70% of my deliveries are not PRIME!  This is just ridiculous!",1
In UK or DE they give big discounts very often. In the Netherlands almost never.,1
"I was a victim of fraud so l called to cancel the fraudulent account but according to te reps l have to login to cancel. What how do you access an account you didn't create. I asked for supervisors because of all the ""overseas"" didn't understand spoke with someone here still the same run around. ",0
"Thank god for amazon! they are a life saver next day delivery sometimes on same day, much better to ebay ect I'm shocked they've got such a bad rating on ere??",2

"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic items for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer assistance every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
Issue after issue I give up now Amazon gone down hall soo much,0
amazon will take ur money and say u dont have the money to add a new card then take the money again talking about they gotta hold it before shipping it. its  better to go to the store then shop with them online,0
Amazon is quick to take your money and process the order. But if you return something even if you never opened it. The item gets delivered back and the process takes longer than the Justice system takes for holding an officer that has killed a black person on camera/with one hundred witnesses accountable for the killing!,0
"Its clear from reviews that customer service via India is the worst possible service available in the current market.  It is also clear that Amazon as a mega giant does not care one bit.  I have just spent two days and spoken to 5 people,  used the chat 3 times and am still, actually more, aggravated than than when i began.  The phone connection is inconsistent and full of static.  The people  accents are very hard to understand. I am first generation American and no stranger to accents but these reps are very garbled in their translation.  First I have twice been told an item that was never delivered would be replaced and that has never happened.  Frankly at this point I feel that they outright lie.  They lie and have no problem with it. And amazon as a company has no problem with the fact that the CS people lie and do not actually follow up on issues.  Second the delivery person here in USA is repeatedly delivering to the wrong address and no one seems to be doing anything about it. One rep actually told me they cannot follow up on something like that.  The items are going to the wrong address so often it seems to be purposeful.  Unfortunately there is no way for me to contact amazon delivery.  i tell india CS it is happening and they say they cannot contact anyone here.",0
"Almost always deliver items in a day or two, unlike eBay, which takes a week or longer. The few items I've had to return were taken back with no issues. I highly recommend Amazon! You're doing a great job!",2

"What's Not too love! Order, delivered to the hedge... So some of the drivers are impatient! But over all excellent service within 24hours on most things, some items are a bit s h I t e and break but again no fuss returns as long as it didn't come from a third party seller. Mainly fabulous could do better.",2
"Amazon is amazing when it comes to customer service.  I had to return a damaged video card and they refunded my money before I even sent the card back, no questions asked.  Now I didn't use amazon again this time, but ordered from NEWEGG and I am having a horrible experience.  NewEgg is lying about my order process, been hung up on 3 times, been lied to twice, my new GPU has been in the ""packing"" stage for 5 days now.  This kind of behavior is unacceptable and this kind of behavior is not what Amazon does.  Amazon is the best!  Screw NewEgg!",2
Amazon is a staple for my Xmas shopping. They make any gift giving an easy task even for the pickiest people. I go to Amazon for everyone & their variety of products make shopping so easy.,2
Use Amazon every week.,2
"Amazon is an outstanding website to purchase a few things online. However, I have issues with delivery. My experience with the delivery is bad. I noticed that I am not the only one who has issues with delivery in my apartment. Some of the residents in the apartment have experienced the same issue. When Item is delivered, they update amazon where the package is left. Therefore, it is delivered with misinformation about the exact location of the package because the package actually was placed outside of the apartment where an individual somehow stole my package. I could not confirm whether it is a false delivery or the package is actually stolen... I had to report it and I requested a refund. Amazon is very hesitant about refunding or replacement. Nowadays, I can not trust amazon with delivery. I start to feel anxious that they will misinform me about where my package was actually placed.",0
"Terrible service, driver marked status as delivered without delivering it. Spent half n hour looking for it. I wont talk about their customer services. The other week they sent half of my food order. Was nice buying from you un the past but i wont be giving amazon any of my hard earned or time",0
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day order and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a support provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after prices were raised and prices are higher than in stores already. Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1
I am always very pleased with Amazon and shop here often,2
"TOTALLY UNEXCEPTABLE2 DAYS AGO I HAD TO GO NEXT DOOR TO PICK UP MY PACKAGE AT THE GRINCH HOUSE THANK GOD SHE WASNT THERE, AND TODAY THEY PUT MY MERCHANDISE IN MY NEIGHBORS BOOK.",0
Horrible.  Unhelpful.  Would not cancel an item ordered by accident.  Doubt I was even talking to an actual person.  And at Christmas.  Leaving me with no cash to buy my daughters gift.  Canceled all products.  Customer service is bull crap,0
Really great company,2
I love everything about Amazon.... need i say more,2
"They are about the worst thimf ever most corrupt idiotic people I’ve ever come in contact with. Jeff Bezos is a narcissist and let all the money he made go to his head. The site is inoperable for the most part and when it is operable and you can actually place an order don’t expect to get what you ordered or get it when you expected it. You will get the wronf items with no customer care to back it up . The customer care chat is only available in the app and it malfunctions. Though it malfunctions, the people who respond also have noAccess to actually assist with anything . They just want to call you and waste moreTime. Who would do this except a narcissist ? Who would have rules like this ? Also in spite of all the times their company is messed up in other accords, the weird thing was my account was blocked because of me using it. So I used to a few other times before and got poor service so I quit using it but someone wanted a gift card so I sent them one and the account was LOCKED because they thought it was fraud even tho it came fromMy IP address. So I do I like chat like I say they people there are of no use they just want me to call. This was for a friends birthday . Time is sensitive in this regard . Wake up",0

Driver didn't bother delivering. Told customer rep who said to give to 10pm and if hadn't arrived would get a full refund. Got message saying attempted delivery. Lies! I have a ring on full settings that's fully working. Driver went home as couldn't be bothered. 4 more reps later and asked to wait longer for £5 as an apology. Said would escalate which I asked them not to as Driver had my address on parcels. No anonymity guarantee and then they were unable to gift the voucher. Said wanted refunded in full. Can't do that either and I'd have to cancel my end. Over an hour with them to give up and go cancel myself. Unable to cancel myself. Insanity! Am so mad at amazon all round. No longer a company to trust. Buyer beware.,0
"3rd party purchases are ruining my thoughts about Amazon purchases.I have found 3rd party purchases to be worse than Ebay in shipping time.Lately, even Amazon fulfilled items with the disclaimer of ""May take 4-5 business days to ship"" are actually saying....""BEWARE, THIS IS NOT IN STOCK. WE HOPE TO HAVE IT AND WILL SHIP IT IF WE GET IT IN TIME. IF NOT, CALL US AND WE WILL LIE ABOUT THE SHIPPING DATE AND FINALLY MAY NOT EVEN GET THE ITEM TO SHIP TO YOU.""",0
Amazon employ thiefs to deliver their items! I have no choice but to stop using their services now as most of the parcels these days never arrive! They dont care if you are in or not and have come home several times to find my purchases left in front of the unsecured see through glass doors that allow literally anyone into our block of flats! Dispicable! Reported several times to them but nothing ever changes.,0
"thieves!software making ""mistakes"" happen, to the disadvantage of their customers",0
"I ordered a gift on Dec 2 and they have been lying to me ever since— jerking the delivery date back and forth. I finally called customer service and the first rep could barely speak English. I tried to be polite but she could not comprehend what I was asking. I demanded a rep in the US who could  understand English and when I got one ( after 20 minutes on hold) she did “get” what I was saying. She filed a stuck order ticket. So-Amazon then lied again and said the item would arrive on the 19th. I knew this was bull because the website STILL did not show it as having been shipped. As of today the site says it will arrive today which of course, is nonsense. Last time I heard from the customer service gal she said it won’t ship till the 28th 😡😡. This episode clearly proves that Amazon listed merchandise for sale for which they lacked sufficient stock to fill orders and instead of being honest, they lie lie lie. And I have been a prime member for well over a decade. Very very disgusted.",0
Hi have just ordered  my grocery  from Morrisons delivered by Amazon on Friday to be delivered  between 4..0pm to 6.0pm did not arrive did not have the transport  to deliver so decided  to reorder for the Saturday  ordered in the morning  to be delivered  between 6.0pm and 8.0pm received  a message  from Amazon approx 7.30pm to be told we are having trouble finding transport to deliver your goods could you wait until 10.30pm before  you or we cancel the order so this one was cancelled  as the first order.  This service  is a shambles ,0

Ordered 4 prime items. Needed today. 2 delivered but in my safe space although I was home!!! 2 apparently unsuccessful delivery as I wasn’t in. Oh yes I was. Idiot forgot them and most probably couldn’t be bothered to come back. I’m fuming as they were birthday presents. Disgusted with Amazon. Really gone downhill!!!,0
"Amazon will make right by their customers. Of course everyone makes mistakes from time to time. But they stand by their return policy, bulky items often not even need to be returned to get refund in case there is a problem. Often, items will arrive earlier than promised, and you can even order to a nearby store or pickup location if you are more comfortable doing that.Amazon is famous for its costumer friendly policies and putting the costumer first.",2
You are my go-to place for anything and everything.,2
I purchased prime membership 6 months before. Most of the times my goodss are delivered late.It says that it will be delivered tomorrow but it gets delivered day after tomorrow or even late sometimes.,1
Option for shipment i use Amazon on a regular basis I like them except they don't give you an option on who you want to to ship your goodss it's simple you pick your shipping company at check out 3rd time I've recommend this thanks,1

Husband knocked every door in our street.......nowhere to be found.Contacted amazon, which is a nightmare trying to do.....the automated responses said would deliver today, site showed delivered to a neighbour in no 4, it was not. Went back on to amazon.....automated again, that said a mistake and will be delivered in 3 days.....absolutely shocking and unbelievable, and very frustrating.Amazon you are worse than useless",0
"Amazon have yet to refund me £160 which they say my bank has, when asked the bank they don't hold money they refund it straight away but amazon seem to think it takes 3to 5 working day depending who you speck to and others say 10 working day, so please be advised when buy from amazon they will not refund you if an item is pressed my mistake or faulty, please don't make my mistake haha happy shopping people or find an alternative",0
The best customer service and high bar for all companies. Quick deliveries and if a package gets lost by the carriers they make the process to send a replacement really easy. Prime is the best!,2
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, goodss are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with goodss directly from Amazon, I find their supports lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1

Rang customer assistances on first attempt not got to a person. 2nd time spoke to a very pleasant customer assistance person  only to find out I had been charged £12 and £5 for late payment.

"As a student, Amazon is my go-to place when ordering online. They have everything you need, student or not, and at cheaper prices than anywhere online most of the time. They also offer second hand items, which is useful for a History Undergrad like me, always buying big ol' dusty textbooks.",2
"I purchased an incorrect item back in Nov 2018. Upon opening the package, I realized my mistake. I immediately applied for a refund, got my refund code, prepared the package to be sent back, and paid for the shipping back to the seller.I contacted Amazon in mid-December after I realized the package had been delivered but my refund had not been received. They told me it could take some time and that they would take care of everything. I left it at that.I had not received anything nor heard from Amazon into early January, so I contacted them again. I got the same response but they were escalating it to their complaints department. Great?!?! now I had to wait for them to get back to me again.I had not received any communication since contacting Amazon earlier in the month. I was getting annoyed. I contacted them for the third time and I got the exact same run around that I was given earlier. I was given three days to hear back from Amazon to see if I can even get my refund.It went from a simple return to the potential I won't even get it. Leaving the seller with both my money and the product. Every agent I spoke to had no information and no power. They couldn't do anything. Useless and a waste of time.I have since deleted all my accounts",0

"Amazon often, but not always, tries to make things right when something goes wrong. When it doesn't try, it's kind of a disaster, but I've had more fine usages than ordinary.ordinary usages have included 1) getting dropped from their referral platform for absolutely no reason (accused of violating platform policy); 2) having packages stolen from my porch and having CS ghost me in trying to figure out a resolution; 3) having third party sellers shirk responsibility for problems and having Amazon tell me it's not their fault, or 4) selling fake goodss or lying about material content or other configuration.In general, I think they're better than plenty of their peers.",1

"To all,We have been Amazon clients for a very long time.We have just ordered an iPhone XV for our daughter...when we received the package, we gave the Amazon code to the delivery guy. The package was sealed with tape. When we opened it their was a Dove lotion bottle - clearly the same weight and size of the iPhone.We called right away the customer service but Amazon said that the package was delivered. They were not nice at all and after 5' of conversation did not seem to care. We had to send photos and we are awaiting their answer within 3 days. This is theft. It can only have taken place in their warehouse or while it was delivered but...someone somewhere must have known what was in the package - which means access to Personal Data! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.NEW SCAM - DO NOT ORDER iPHONE or anything expensive - Warehouse or delivery THEFT!",0
Products are overall pretty acceptable. But order is horrible. So many things have not been delivered on time. UPS delivered way better than Uber or prime order trucks. Very frustrating.,1
So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years and when they say your package is arriving or it’s going to be delivered then that’s what it is. So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very average business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,1

"I've always wanted to purchase things from Amazon, since they have a variety of items and brands that I love but the most annoying thing is, they will never deliver items to my country. Only to my neighbouring countries OR when the item is available to my country, it is out of stock. But after reading everyone's reviews on Amazon and here, I think I should be thankful that I couldn't purchase anything from this website, considering how they actually accept used and returned products and then sent it out to other customers. I've seen way too many reviews mentioning that. The chances of me getting a used item is high, so no way I'm gonna purchase stuff from Amazon. And some of the sellers would actually sell fake stuff too, so nope. I ain't gonna patron Amazon.",0

"I don't have personal experiences or opinions. However, I can provide information about Amazon. It is a multinational technology and e-commerce company based in Seattle, Washington. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon started as an online bookstore and has since expanded into various product categories, including electronics, apparel, and cloud computing services through Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is known for its customer-centric approach, vast product selection, and innovative services like Amazon Prime. If you have specific questions about Amazon, feel free to ask!",2
"Amazon support is the worst. I got a defective item and it stopped working just days after the return window. The seller said they would send a replacement and to have amazon support help me with getting the shipping handled since their products are in amazons warehouse. The agents refused to listen or help and just copy and paste the same responses. They refuse to help and then lie to customers. One amazon agent told me that sellers have sent replacements to customers in the past, so that meant for a FACT that this seller also has a personal warehouse. Literally said it was a fact, but then when I asked if that seller for a fact has a warehouse because the agent knew of some sellers having their own warehouses? the agent refused to respond and just kept changing the subject. I asked the agent how they could know for a fact that the agent had a warehouse? Refused to answer. So I asked if they lied about knowing for a fact that the Seller had a warehouse, and the agent said that they could not confirm or deny that.... Wow amazon. Went from stellar support to almost one star reviews on trust pilot... Not to mention stores like costco (their membership costs less than amazons even) offers 90 day returns. Walmart, with NO membership offers 90 day returns as well and I have never had issues with their support either. You spend days trying to get help and get no resolutions. With all the money amazon generates, put some money BACK into customer service, and stop outsourcing the work to people who could not give less of a damn about the customers or their experience.",0
"With a single push of a button, your enrolled in a membership, your account is charged. There is no security measure in place to make sure this was not a mistake. When you cancel there are multiple steps in place to make sure,this is what you want. Most companies ask for confirmation so deceptive practices are not used. Very insidious business practices.",0
Why do Amazon continue to send delivery confirmation emails when the orders haven’t actually been delivered?When I queried I was told that although I received a delivery confirmation email it can take up to 48hrs after the email for the order to be delivered! Ridiculous!,0

I was shocked.Amazon.de customer support stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1
Every time I order I'm left with tons of Packaging to dispose of!,1

"This is not a review about Amazon but on Samsung which Amazon sells many of their products.  You can not trust what the Samsung company tells you!     Here's my story;In December of 2020, I contacted Samsung customer service directly because I wanted to purchase a television that was compatible with the MLB Channel.  The Samsung customer service person recommended a television and assured me that it was compatible with the MLB Channel. (I have a copy of the e-mail stating this)The baseball season did not start until April so I could not test it out ahead of time. Now it's over the return period.  I contacted Samsung and was told there's nothing they can do.  Which tells me that they do not stand behind their product and do not value me as a customer. So don't trust Samsung to do the right thing! I will no longer be a Samsung customer.",0

Slow not what it use to b years ago! Much more goodss,1
"Been a customer to Amazon for years now and just getting fed up of all their cons. Happy to keep my account so the kids can use Alexa and my wife can read her kindle however I will not be shopping with them again. Extremely poor service. Very disappointed and disgusted at their recent service. Just the usual from a large company, think they can do what they want. Happy to give my money to other on line services.",0
Review sites should start giving us the opportunity to leave negative star reviews. I bought a set of frangrances from one of their sellers. They turned out to be fake. They must have bought the real versions split them and mixed them with water. The company changed it’s name the minute I placed the order. Insane!! Amazon says I can’t leave a review exposing them. WHATEVER!! Then I’ll leave one exposing them! On numerous review sites!!,0
"I received the wrong item from an Amazon purchase and returned it.  The total cost of the item was approx. $500.   I have returned purchases to Amazon many times and the returned funds have always posted against my Amazon credit card balance.  This time the credit posted to a non-existent Amazon gift card.  When returning the item, Amazon preselected “refund to your Amazon account balance”.  This in no way indicates it is returning the money to a non-existent gift card.  To add insult to injury purchases were posted against the gift card vs my Amazon credit card so they won’t refund the remaining gift card balance to my Amazon credit card!!  This seems to be entrapment, as Amazon’s messaging regarding where the funds are being returned to isn’t clear!  It seems Amazon is intentionally using vague language in their auto pre-selected option for returned funds to ensure customers spend the returned money through their company!  If this is unintentional, Amazon should add “gift card” to the auto pre-selected return funds option so customers understand the funds will not be returned to their Amazon credit card used to make the purchase, but instead be added to a non-existent gift card balance.  The gift card was created at the time of the refund!  As I stated above, this seems like financial entrapment to ensure returned funds remain with AMAZON vs being credited to the Amazon credit card used to make the purchase! I believe any reasonable person would assume “be returned to Amazon account balance” means being returned to your Amazon credit card balance.  Especially since at the time of the return there were no other Amazon account balances other than the credit card, there weren’t any gift cards on file, and every other refund processed through Amazon had been credited to my Amazon credit card balance. When “gift card” isn’t in the sentence of the pre-selected option, and Amazon has credit card options, it seems like it is an intentional action by Amazon to be vague in their messaging to entrap customer’s funds and ensure more funds are expended through Amazon!  I rarely write reviews, but felt people should know about Amazon’s ridiculous refund policy/messaging, as it could really cause harm to families already in financial distress due to the resent pandemic and resulting economic downturn.",0
Excellent service and prompt delivery. Secure packing.,2
"Their customer support needs a major improvement.  They need to watch for fake items and horrible sellers. I bought something special for my mom, received the wrong item, and they were mad at me for it.  Do something to fix your company Amazon.",1

"This is a pretty long story but TLDR; returned faulty iMac to Amazon using my own chosen courier after they refused to arrange a collection - now have both my item and funds and are refusing to refund me.A while back I purchased an iMac however as it was faulty, I requested a return. Amazon refused to pick up the package and would only help me out if I used my own courier. I arranged a UPS collection from my house and Amazon then refunded me for my shipping after providing them with my shipping invoice which also included tracking number. The item was returned to Amazon a day after it was collected from my address so after chasing up multiple times (one day I was literally transferred to 7 agents and then eventually a ‘manager’ who was unable to provide me with a resolution as I didn’t have a collection receipt - I was never told I needed to provide this and UPS never handed a collection receipt over to me upon pickup, as the tracking was provided I didn’t understand why this was needed also. After even more back and forth I was told to wait 14 days and that I wouldn’t need to wait any longer… 14 days passed no refund no update but received multiple emails saying my refund was processed and then other emails saying it would be processed etc etc… After even more correspondence I have been told to wait up to 30 days which is almost up as of next week and still no sign of a refund. The situation has made me feel physically Ill as I doubt I will be getting me refund and nobody is willing to help me. I’m out of 1,200 as well as an iMac.Worst experience ever - not sure if these reviews are anonymous but any advice on how I can get my refund or take legal action would be appreciated. Disgusting service.",0
"I use Amazon often.  There is a large selection of goods.Their delivery is stated so you know when to expect it, usually within estimated time.Never had any problems.Their subscribe and save is a good service for regular deliveries and save a little extra.",2
"Refused to issue a refund - THEIR error.  Bought a pair of OTC hearing aids for $500.  Clearly stated returnable until 1/31/24.  I didn't like them, so sent them back in the original packaging.  They claim I returned an OLDER MODEL (which I of course have never owned), and they couldn't issue a refund.  No proof of what they stated.  Geez.  Unbelievable.",0
"The packaging of Amazon is really good, but it's annoying to unpack. The 10000 tape packages are too much to unpack, but after we unpack, the quality of the package is impeccable.",2
Terrible Site go to eBay and search for something and it will take you what you are looking for whoever's working at Amazon does not have a clue if you search anything on Amazon they do not show you anything your looking for try eBay one time and I promise no one will.use Amazon again.,0

"Generally, I like the Amazon operation. However, there is one part of the operation that causes me concern, and that is book supply. At times over the years, I have bought 'books', which turn out to be little more than 'cut and paste' exercises by some plagiarist. The latest one claimed it was published by Amazon and I suppose it was via the Kindle platform. Amazon should stop this practise, plagiarism stinks. I just wonder how many copyright laws have been broken.",2
Good for the most part but customer assistance can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon goods or 3rd party seller,1
Warning if you order anything of value and the courier decides not to deliver or deliveries somewhere else AMAZON will use every excuse known to man not to refund you1. No signature has not to been obtained.2. Tracking info states delivered to a (shed) I don't have a shed.3. Amazon told me to wait for 72+ hours.4. I need a crime number from the police.5. Check with neighbours.6. Reported missing item to the police I have a crime number.AND STILL NO REFUND. County court proceedings now!Please see the Consumer Rights Act 2015 Amazon liable,0
love amazon ,1
Amazon can be fine but when its average its average. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
"Your order staff are rubbish, they just throw packages into porch and walk off leaving porch door open.This is a repeat complaint and you do nothing about training. They are all THICK AND USELESS",1
Have been purchasing from Amazon for years I've bought many wonderful products. I'll always give 5 star reviews made one negative review about a bogus product was absolutely misrepresented.. Now Amazon has removed all of my reviews throughout the history of my purchases and I am no longer allowed to review any products. How. How is the customer supposed to make an educated choice on a product if the negative reviews are removed,0
"Do not put any giftcards or balance in your amazon account. I have been a prime member for over a year and have purchased $10000s worth of items. Amazon pushed the idea of reloading the account balance, and even offered incentives to do so. Once I added money to the account, it was instantly closed due to ""unauthorized users accessing the account""So in order to protect the $2000 I recently added to the account, they decided to steal them for themselves.This is a common scam according to google, never load any giftcards onto amazon, never buy giftcards from amazon and never signup for amazon prime for a year in advance.",0
"Amazon are a great company being let down by too many order drivers not following saved order instructions in our area ( Shortstown, Bedford ).",1
"At this point impossible to maintain the expectation for the number of customers and business they are responsible of.The system is not there to serve the large mass of customers and businesses on Amazon. Yet, it is still the largest e-commerce site. It is convenient, easy to utilize and buy.  As a business you do get the large reach to the audience and credibility.However, you should not only rely on this website.  There were items that get to me quickly and some that never arrived or cancelled. Well I never lost money yet, and nothing really amazing either.",1
"Amazon prime temporarily locked my account out of the blue for no reason. And it keeps telling me to contact the support team, only problem is, when I try contacting the support team, it tells me to log in WITCH I CAN NOT DO!!! So I am completely stuck, and because they have no other way of reaching out to them, then call (which I will not do from Denmark). Sooooo I guess I have to tell my bank to block any payments to amazon prime. Edit: I ended up creating another acount with another email, and got through to live chat. The promised to resolve the issue within 48 hours, so lets wait and see if thet actually does help",0
"Oh Amazon, what would I do with out you.😀👌Amazing products, amazing price, lots of choices and above all, the best customer service ever. No one compares to amazon.",2

Amazon account specialists will close customers accounts with huge gift card balance inside without reason. How can amazon sell gift cards and later block your account when you use said gift cards on your account?  Amazon Is a fraud company,0
I am not getting OTPs sent to my phone in South Africa which has worked for decades  it suddenly stopped working yesterday. Now that phone number has been blocked. I’ve spent 3 hours on chat and phone calls with Amazon Cistomer Support where I repeated the simple problem over and over and over again and no one could help. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. No exaggeration. So we set up a new account with my wife’s details which was fine. When we tried to enter hýe ozone number once again no OTP arrived at her phone. They keep on insisting we are making the error and yet it is their system. I e been using Amazon and the OTP for many years and it suddenly stops working but not one of the 12 customer service agents could help,0

"Become an awful company during this lockdown, unprofessional and complacent!Their policies have gone out the window for the customer, 4 disputes and 2 weeks to achieve a refund, on top of that I was lied to twice that my refund had been processed, which a Manager actually admitted to after a huge argument. Have cancelled my prime, and will not be renewing with this awful company anymore, the film site is rubbish, Netflix is the better option, Amazon music is a compete rip off, you pay £7.99 for Prime, then the thieving CEO of this company wants another £9.99 to get all the music, well guess what you get better music on Spotify for less money and as for shopping, everything is cheaper on Ebay and gets to you just as quick. Plus any problems you're refunded with no issues. There's definitely life without Amazon!!!!",0
I can't see that there's anything to complain about Amazon.  I keep the UPS driver very busy so I know what I'm talking about. 😁🙂Great company to deal with in every way.,2
"customer service good beyond belief. made more than 100 orders, problems with about 10. everything resolved perfectly.",2
"UK customer service was abysmal.  It is probably outsourced and there is no accountability because Amazon is too fragmented. They kept telling me 5 weeks delivery (yes  really) could not be improved because of their ""process"", and said I should cancel if not happy (yes really). After 1 wasted one hour of my life trying to get reasonable treatment - item was in stock in UK, but I hadn't joined Prime, nor paid for delivery. We ended our non productive ""chat"" with intransigent agent.  Then I paid £5 extra for priority delivery. Hey presto ,- item was delivered within 2 days! (Yes really). Morale of this true story is be ultra careful when you place order regarding delivery ""promise"" as you won't get any help if things go wrong. Outsourced customer service staff clearly need training, but Amazon is that big  they probably won't bother.",0
Brilliant is the only word to describe Amazon,2

"Bought a Kindle on a 50% offer. After 2 weeks I was told they didn’t have any left and couldn't tell me if/when it would be delivered. The only thing they could offer was a refund.What they actually meant was they'd put the price back up so wouldn’t fulfil my order, I can order one now at full price for delivery tomorrow!",0
Don’t gave amazon your credit card number or any information.Becouse they take out $371.00 from my account and I didn’t order anything with that amount.When I called them it was not in their records but why did it say amazon.So my bank is looking into now.So beware if you use them and keep track of your bank account or you will be next.I will never  order anything from them again.,0
"My wife and I are dedicated Kindle fans and Amazon customers. They released the new line of Kindle's this week which made us both happy (it's the best e-reader out there and improving it even more is terrific) and a little frustrated. You see, my 2nd Generation Kindle is only 18 months old and is now 2 generations out of date. My wife's Kindle is a 3rd generation and less than 7 months old. I suggested to Amazon, through a web form, that they initiate a buy-back or loyalty credit program to allow 0Kindle owners to upgrade. I was a bit frustrated when I got an email response saying no, apparently from a call center in India. The form asked me if I was satisfied with the response. I clicked ""no"" and within 5 minutes, Amazon called me on my cellphone. I calmly explained my idea and the frustration of the very automated ""no"" response and they took everything I said on board. While they don't have a buy-back program, they gave me 2 x $40 credits to use against new Kindle devices. I should explain that I am an Amazon Prime member and that I do spend a couple of thousand a year between books, e-books, gifts, movies and electronics on Amazon, but they impressed me by responding well and recognizing loyalty.",2
Great web site,2
"At one time, Amazon was an efficient, reliable and customer-focused organization. That being said, over the past 24 months, they have become one of the most unreliable and inefficient logistical/retail services I have ever dealt with. Products take longer to arrive when compared to other retailers who don't charge an annual fee and delivery windows are often missed. Customer service agents are based outside of North American and for the most part, are difficult to deal with and generally require further explanation and reiteration to resolve the most basic issues. We have also noticed a steep decline in Amazon's streaming services including the quality and reliability of the content. Lastly, we have found Amazon's customer experience extremely poor. Streaming subscriptions that provided specific movies, that we have maintained for several years are no longer available and can only be ""purchased or rented"". This is extremely poor practice and given that it appears to be (primarily) the movies we have watched, I am inclined to believe that this is an intentional act to force us to buy these movies despite already paying for the subscription. We will be canceling our Prime membership, along with all subscriptions in November when they raise the price.",0
"I absolutely love Amazon and have been shopping with them for years, but I couldn't believe it when a Botabay Dog Stroller was bought as a gift for my ageing dog from my sister and the description states that it has a rear storage pocket, it doesn't!!! That was one of the main reasons it was purchased. My ageing dog loves it, but we are so disappointed. My sister spent over £205.00 on it.......how disappointing!!!",1
Love em! Great company with exceptional service and prices.,2
"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has fine infrastructure (fast shipment, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1
"Amazon’s order support is decent and legit quicker than other ecommerce in Australia, But the subscription plans are pretty suspicious. I got phone calls from amazon in my personal number which I registered in amazon, and someone said that your prime subscription is turned on (But it’s not) and you are about to be charged 80 dollars for that. I said I am rich, don’t worry about the payment. Then I removed my bank card from the app.",1
Amazon has improved their service in my experience. I would use them again.,2
"Had a transaction for over £500 made on my account, only way I found it was that there was an address in the USA on my delivery addresses. They'd archived the order.At no point in the thieving little c*nts purchases did Amazon have any system that might have queried why £500 worth of stuff was going to the USA under a different name (internet security 101)Tried contacting them and the customer services are completely useless. Talk about the Spanish inquisition! No I don't know some random yahoo in America! They've made a serious balls up and will have to investigate before I get my money back.Hold your hands up and admit your security systems are crap and refund me immediately. If the shoe was on the other foot it would be slightly different. Take criminal activity going on in your business seriously!",0
My son ordered the Lego R2D2. It arrived today and on inspection 3 of the packs had been opened and resealed. Ironically the packs which had been opened contained the parts which make up the mini figures. Both of which are 2 of the ones which are highly collectible. All Amazon say when contacted they said to refer to Lego. This has never happened with items bought from Lego. Someone is making a bit on the side opening these packages!!!,0
Amazons 3rd party sellers are horrible. I ordered wheels from one seller and tires from another. The wheels are lost somewhere in transit and the tires where delivered  missing 2 out of 5 tires.Amazon needs better rules and guidelines to be a 3rd party seller.,0

"Amazon has been slipping for a while. Their shipping has been getting longer and longer. They will tell you at check out when the item(s) will be delivered and the item(s) arrive a week later. Being a Prime member at one time had benefits, now its becoming a nice cash cow for Amazon without providing what was, top notch assistance and order. One day, about 4 years ago, I orderd an item from Amazon and it actually arrived the same day! I was sold on Amazon, now I can take 20 minutes of my time and go to Walmart, pay less and have the item in my hand when i leave the store. This is what happens when a company get too big for itself.",1

I purchased a oil painting pai t by numbers.  Cost about $30.00 the seller is a third-party.  Amazon has not supported my efforts to get a refund.  I have not received my order.

"3 years ago someone who spoke English would have solved my issue within 5 minutes. It took 30 minutes, 2 phone calls and 7 customer service agents to tell me that they could not help me, nor truly understand my issue. This was an utter waste of time. Amazon has really gone down hill.",0
Every time I have an issue they sort it straight away. Live Amazon!,2
I've had a refund in limbo for a macbook pro for a month and support has been useless and even hung up on me after refusing to tell me their full name.  It should be illegal to hold on to such a large amount of money for so long.  I still have no idea when or if my refund is going to be processed.  I've been an amazon customer since 2002 and the quality of their product has been in constant decline the last few years.,0
"Vulgar through and through next day delivery load of rubbish, was supposed to be here today got a delivery time scale then it changed to alater time scale, says neighbours get delivery's from amazon courier but skipped my address, contacted vulgar amazon customer services and all I got was wait till 10pm wait till 10pm waited few hours longer went back through to be fobbed off again u till I demanded to make an official complaint got another useless waste of space advisor, who initially tied saying that delivery was attempted at 2.11pm soon changed their tune on that when advised them I have cctv and can prive otherwise, he offered to compensate for the vile service with delivery and offered and a massive insulting £5 credit on my account of course i told them to keep it. Moral of this story is don't bother paying for prime as your don't get ypur spaces next day as it states, miss selling at it finest well I will be reporting them. Thieves avoid them and don't not invest in prime, u don't get what ypy pay for.",0
"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank acceptableness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your support we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy,2
"Purchased same swim shirt in two different colors last Monday for $20.98 each. When I tried them on this afternoon they were a little too big, so wanted to exchange them for next size down. Since Amazon does not do exchanges and only refunds, so I would have had to purchase the shirts again in my new desired size while returning the previous ones I received. Unfortunately, the same exact shirts are now $29 each today! That is a pretty significant increase from just 7 days ago! Now I know you can receive a refund for the difference if an item/product you purchased days before goes DOWN in price, but what about those who have or will experience a similar scenario as mine? All I wanted to do was exchange them for a smaller size and pay more or less the same price as last week. How is this fair? It isn't. SMH...",0
prices very acceptable shame some items come not very well packed and have to go back replacement and refund policy very acceptable shame i have to use it often,1
Amazon needs to be stopped by government for exploiting workers and retailers.They harbor horrific slave like conditions by underpaying and overworking staff and screwing suppliers.They debited my card for a subscription I didn't set up and refused to refund meAwful business.I hope Jeff Bezos never comes back from his space trip.,0

"I ordered off a supplier through Amazon, I ordered three of the items and later discovered Amazon charged me 3x the delivery fee. The product was ordered and would be delivered together!! I requested Amazon to refund 2 x the delivery fee and they refused and also decided to argue with me consistently back and fore on email until I got fed up of their confrontational attitude and gave up. I to date have never received the goods that I paid including delivery of £35.00. They decided to deliver early without warning I was at work so they decided to leave at a post office depot miles away from where I live. I am not going to collect the goods and made that clear to Amazon on email. So to date I do not have the goods and they still have my £35. I will never order from Amazon again. I have made that clear to them and they don't care as they are literally in the pound seat. Dispicable!!!!",2
"I have been a customer of amazon.com for a long time. I am overall satisfied with its assistances. However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer assistance to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service has had a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.",1

They told me I need to get a police report for them , police told me that Amazon need to contact them as it’s there issue as there drivers didn’t deliver , I’ve asked Amazon repeatedly to send me proof ( photo, signature) that item was delivered, they  said they have none. Now because it’s more than sixty days Amazon are saying case closed and I’m not allowed a refund for items I’ve paid for and didn’t receive. Isn’t that theft ??? They drag the process out and don’t get back to you when they say they will do so the case goes over 60 days . Will never in my lifetime purchase anything of them again.",0
"I have just recently started shopping online in Amazon. They are able to ship the deliveries on time when I purchase the items. But when I try to return a item that I incorrectly purchased, it still said pending item returned for a drop bar handle bike via Canada Post, it has been since June 24th that I have been waiting for the refund. According to the Canada Post site and tracking system, it said that it was returned and shipped to the Amazon warehouse, but on the Amazon tracking status it still says it is waiting for the item to be returned to it. What is your phone number or email as I tried finding the phone number for the site but had a hard time. Please help!!!",1
"Everytime i order, always comes on time, always sold at a brilliant price, saves shipping and payment details so it's always spot on with no hassle!",2
I was able to purchase some old books I had been looking for for a long time. The book is The Black Book of Communism. It was written by 6 frenchmen. Everyone should read it. Excellent.,2
Always had a great usage except for the one last time. i will come back edit this review if I have a decent usage next time.,1
"A few weeks ago I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase a sewing machine, for those of you who don’t know, this isn’t a cheap purchase by any means. So to save a few dollars I buy a factory refurbished model being sold by Amazon, great reviews, all the bells and whistles, and roughly $150 worth of included accessories. Order showed up a day early and I’m super excited to set it up and start figuring this machine out, but much to my disappointment when I unpacked the box none of the accessories were there except for one, or so I thought. In my disappointment I started a return when I was offered a replacement item to be shipped to me next day and I had a month to return to one I had with missing pieces for free, using a UPS pickup, just had to confirm that it I didn’t return the item the full cost would be charged to my original payment method, which couldn’t happen, this was a splurge, but since I was absolutely returning it I wasn’t worried about this and agreed. Since I was bored and decided that I could still mess around with the machine without the optional accessories that were to be included I set it up and started reading through the manual when in it I discovered basically a hidden storage compartment in the base of the machine. Open it up and ta-da there’s my “missing” accessories. So I hurry up and try to cancel the replacement but it has already shipped so I can’t, okay no problem I’ll just return it when it gets here. While laughing with my mom about my little blonde moment she mentions that she would like to learn to sew and wants to buy this machine off of me, okay no problem I just have to get ahold of Amazon and have them change the payment method they will charge when I don’t return it since I didn’t want the charge on a credit card. Contact CS through the chat feature and explain that I no longer wish to return either machine and that I need to pay for the replacement one but need to change my payment method. CS Rep asks me to wait for a few moments while she sees if this is something she can do, when she responds she says that she is unable to change the payment method after an order has been placed, but that I haven’t been charged. Confused at this point I tell her I know I haven’t been yet because I was to return one machine but that I will no longer be returning it and I agreed to be charged the full amount for both if I didn’t send one back and that I was just trying to pay for the second machine. At this point she tells me she understands all of this, and that what she was trying to say is that she will switch the replacement to a return so that I can keep both machines and not be charged for the second one. At this point I’m floored, but this was my mistake, and I’m not trying to not pay for it, I just want to use a different card to pay for it, why should Amazon give me a free machine just because I can’t change a payment method on a machine I wouldn’t have even needed shipped to me had I dug a little deeper in search of the accessories? Again she confirms that I can keep both machines with no charge for the second machine, also that she will send me email confirmation of this at my request, just in case a charge shows up on my card because this seems to good to be true. Within 30 seconds of ending the chat I have email confirmation of keeping both machines and not being charged for the second one. Wow. Thank you Amazon, you made myself and my mother very very happy yesterday. Never would have dreamed I would end up with a free mid level Brother sewing machine by contacting Amazon in an attempt to PAY for said sewing machine just because they don’t have the ability to change my payment method. Still in shocked disbelief, I guess the karma gods were happy with me yesterday.",2
"I have had an awful experience with an Amazon purchase.  First, the representative suggested I apply for Amazon Prime credit card because they offer 10 months interest free and my purchase was over $1700.00.  I applied with him but my purchase did not get put under the interest free option so I owe full amount.  I only applied for the credit card for the interest free option.  WHAT A SCAM.Secondly, I picked a delivery date for my item and it is for next month on a Saturday.  I triple checked that I could pick such a date and was assured yes only to find out no.  The delivery company tried to deliver a month ahead of time.  When I called Amazon they lied to me about what had transpired and blamed delivery company.Next, the delivery company contacted me again and this time it is 2 weeks before delivery to tell me they DO NOT DELIVER on Saturday's even though the Amazon Representative said I could pick any date available on the calendar.Lastly, spent over 3 hours talking to Amazon Customer Amazon Service Representatives trying to get all matters resolved and to date, nothing has been resolved to my satisfaction.My advice, DO NOT PURCHASE LARGE FURNITURE ON AMAZON AND DO NOT APPLY FOR THEIR BOGUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS.Completely disappointed with Amazon and the lack of customer service.",0
Amazon chat never  seems to dissapoint.I always have such great experiences. ,2
"I've ordered from Amazon several times in the past year, but the purchasing interaction varies. Products fulfilled by Amazon, such as Kindle Paperwhite, were well received and packaged. However, there have been misses as well, such as a gorillapod fulfilled by a third party seller on Amazon. It was a cheap knockoff and Amazon somehow disallowed me to post a negative review on their listing for this goods. Felt so cheated!",1
The things I find on amazon always seem expensive to me,1
Okay customer support but their order is amazing,1
excellent delivering! I got the package a day earlier than expected and it was very easy to track the package and see how far it was. I ordered from Denmark and only payed a small prize for taxes when it arrived (44 kr),2
I love amazon and their employees was pretty decent as well,1

"Amazon continues to impress with its vast selection and quick delivery. My recent purchases arrived on time and in good condition. However, I noticed a slight increase in prices and some inconsistencies in product quality. Despite these issues, Amazon's customer service was responsive and helpful, resolving my concerns efficiently. Overall, a reliable choice for online shopping, but there's room for improvement.",2

I wasn't the happiest about the shipping because the seller never gave a tracking # or confirmation of shipping, so I had no idea why it was taking so long to just ship out one little purse then all of a sudden came in the mail one day. I hate that because we have had issues with carriers delivering to wrong address!

I ordered Onion oil in Amazon but they delivered me Argon oil.. I received 3 products same time so I didn't check the name n started using when I used for the second time only I saw it's not Onion oil n it's Argon oil.. I was shocked n checked my order in Amazon I have ordered Onion oil but they delivered a wrong product.. When I called Amazon they're saying time is over it's been 15 days now since the product is been delivered so they can't do anything.. so sending the wrong product is not a mistake but which I didn't verify is a mistake.. people please don't trust Amazon any more.. SENDING WRONG PRODUCT AND BLAMING THE CUSTOMER N ONE MORE CHECK WHETHER THE BEAUTY PRODUCTS YOU GET THROUGH AMAZON IS GENUINE. Thank You all..,0
"I ordered an item on November 15. I received the item November 17. Unfortunately the order person did not put the item in my mailbox but put it sticking out under the doormat, It would have fit in the mailbox but the lid on the box would not be able to close. that is not a problem. The post office routinely puts letters and packages in the box even though the box lid does not close. I would have preferred the item be put in the box and not partially under the mat. I did see the package but had i not been paying attention I would have stepped on it. Please put my packages in the mailbox. Thank you.",1

"Never, ever use Amazon Payments! Sure it works as a payment form, but when you have trouble getting your money back on a subscription that was already cancelled, Amazon customer service is non-existing. Have spend the last 3 days trying to get help from Amazon customer service, and it is quite clear, that despite numerous mails from their side regarding ""our customer is important"", they have no intention of helping me with a mistake that they made... Very disappointing and the last time that I will use their Payments.",0

"Bought several presents in the days before Christmas. Was delivered at 8pm the day before, but they did keep their promise! I don't know how they do it!",2
I pay for prime and its normally decent but recently deliveries have gone missing or been broken they also have proved they don't check sizes from third party sellers as I bought an item listed as UK large and received Chinese large which is basically a UK small. Customer support have been shocking and rude.,1
I love shopping at Amazon...but don’t try to contact them..I got a scam call today saying a charge of over $700 was being added to my account..I tried comtacting Amazon with their form..”call me”...that didn’t happen...”chat with advisor” ...couldn’t do that either..no shows..they are decent at collecting the money but customer assistance...no show.  So disappointing..not that they care...too busy raking the cash in.  Not the first time ...I should have known not to waste my time.,1
"it is bad enough that your drivers do not allow time for your customers to get to the front door but what is worse is that having rung the bell and immediately walking off they then leave the parcel in full view of the whole street.

"Amazon is dropping the great customer support they use to have by allowing sellers to dictate the length of time to get your refund whenever an item is Not received, instead of issuing a gift card with credit one has to wait for about 7+/- days to receive money which you had already paid..unacceptable customer support and fine use of public funds if you multiply every customer",1

I absolutely love Amazon prime the addition of movies  and next day delivery on thousands of products is incredible sometimes I would sooner wait for the delivery man to arrive the next morning or afternoon than queue in a store. its the future of shopping,2
Horrible customer service - I got a new cell phone number and can’t access my account because my cell number tied to my Amazon account is an old number. I called customer service and they are jerks - say they are in Seattle when in fact they are overseas and their phone systems suck - what a pain - Amazon is going down hill in a hurry - I won’t be using them going forward!

"I made an order online to buy some extension cables for my house.

Always been impressed with Amazon customer service. They have sorted any issues I had straight away and the agents are fabulous. This is why Amazon will always get my custom.I prefer to buy items actually from Amazon rather than ones that come from sellers as I’ve had a few problems with items from sellers. Amazon have always put it right though. Other companies could learn from Amazon customer service. I have to shield as I’m on chemotherapy and have relied on Amazon though lockdown. They are fantastic.,2
"Amazon is my go to for obvious reasons. I'm a prime member, prime fresh, etc...I love the services they offer. It's so convenient, how could you not use them? Anytime I need a refund it is pretty much instant. I've also been getting one day shipping as of late. Can't complain about that.They lose a star for being a morally grey company.",2

"I bought some vinyl records from amazon recently, but when they arrived I found they had warped from heat and were damaged beyond repair. I contacted customer service and they immediately offered to send me replacements, without even requesting that I send back the defective items first. This is top class customer service!",2
"Do not buy from Amazon. Their customer service has become among the worst in the industry. I purchased a number of items all of which were not the products that I ordered, were defective, and/or were damaged. I was instructed to return the items at my cost and Amazon would refund the money and reimburse me for the shipping charges. Amazon did not refund my money and did not reimburse me for the shipping charges. I spent four months hassling with customer service in an attempt to resolve the matter. Amazon has refused to do anything about it and, in fact, has told me that if I raise the issue with them anymore, I will be ignored. That is some excellent customer service. I have no products, I have no refund, and I have not been reimbursed. The letter I sent was addressed to Mike Roth, the Vice President of North America Operations. He referred the matter to a customer service specialist to take care of whose name was Amanda Beach. Amanda is the most obnoxious and hostile Amazon representative. The public should be careful in buying from Amazon unless they guarantee you a refund with a prepaid shipping label. Amazon is next on the list to go downhill. When a company customer service fails, the company falls through the hole. The next thing to come is that Amazon’s fulfillment centers will be for salealong with their newly purchased Amazon prime aircraft.YG",0
"Most websites have this option of saving a wishlist, my favorite sites have the option of saving items on the websites personal wish list or on amazon's wish list.  I can't always remember all of the website where I have items saved, or which item is in which website; I can, however, always go on amazon and check all of the items I have saved (no matter what website they are from), and there is always the option of grouping different items together.Love It!!",2
"I recently order a tonneau cover for my truck. The item ships in 2 pieces: the cover and the rails. Amazon only shipped the cover and did not ship the rails. I called their customer support and was told there was no way for them to ship me the missing box... instead, I would have to return the product and re-order.I returned the one box I had received and waited for Amazon to receive the returned item. After 2 weeks, I still had not received a refund, so I called customer service once again. Apparently, something was missed so they hadn't issued a refund. 5 days later, my credit card was refunded.As requested, I re-ordered the product. Once again, I received only the cover and not the rails. When I called Amazon, I was told I couldn't return it because it hadn't been delivered even though it was clearly sitting in my garage (apparently it did not show up as delivered in their system). I waited until it showed as delivered online and called customer service again (4th time if you're keeping count). Same story... they cannot send me the missing box so I will have to return the cover and re-order.This has been going on for almost 2 months now.The saga continues... Given this is an oversized item, it must be picked up by a local carrier. After 10 days, 3 calls to customer service, and 4 emails to customer service, I finally received the email I needed that needed to be forwarded to the local carrier. 2 weeks after initial delivery, the box was picked up and is on route to Amazon.Not over yet! The one box was picked up from my home on November 10th. It took until November 21st to get to Amazon in Toronto. Amazon now claims they need up to 14 days to process the return and issue my refund. As of November 30th, Amazon's systems have yet to be updated... and of course, no refund.",0

Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty fine but they really do need to sort out their third party shipment  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1
"I'm shocked at the poor reviews Amazon has on this site. I guess the only ones leaving reviews here are those looking to vent. Been shopping from them since they only sold books. Best customer service in the world, bar none. You can always trust them to fix any problem you have with your orders.",2
"If I could give zero stars I would. Once again, Amazon's continued use of the United States Postal Service (USPS) has screwed me, too many times to count. You pay for GUARANTEED delivery by a certain date, but God forbid if you live in an apartment or condo complex. UPS and FedEx hand deliver all packages right to my door on time as they are supposed to, but not the laziest people on earth who work for the USPS. I get package delivery notices in my box requiring ME to travel 20 miles round trip to pick up my package, which will now be 2 days LATE at least before I have time to do so. I have registered complaints with Amazon but they do not care and REFUSE to hold the USPS to the same delivery standards as UPS and FedEx, but continue to say my delivery is GUARANTEED. BS! I have also asked them to tell me WHO will be delivering my package prior to placing my order, and again they REFUSE to change their policy and at least let me know that so I can go someplace else without this hassle. In the future anytime I see that USPS is my carrier I am cancelling my order and going elsewhere. Go to hell USPS, and you wonder why you are losing money. If you were a private company you would be out of business. Amazon should be ASHAMED of themselves for allowing them to continue to deliver sub-standard service compared to other carriers.",0
Shipping is hit and miss. Mostly miss. They don't post real reviews. If you have anything negative to say about anything they usually don't post it. Most items now are shipped from china in my experience. They charge your credit/debit card before they ship 99 percent of the time. They have horrible customer service. What use to take 2 or 3 days is now 2 or 3 weeks. They don't tag out of country sales and usually the sellers doesn't mention where the item ships from or made. Amazon is just another big corporation that cares only about themselves and how much money they rake in. No more Amazon for me period. Support your local community by buying local.,0
Always responsive and professional even when there is an error with the order.  I wish other online stores kept to the same high standard as Amazon.,2

Ordered something on prime for delivery yesterday. Said it would delivered by 10pm and was on the phone to customer service who might I add are very rude and spoke to me like I was stupid.

"I have been a Prime customer for yers and have always had a pretty fine usage up until the last few months. More times than not when I select a goods it will give an estimate of 1-2 days on shipping, but once I pay for the item and it gets shipped, the shipping time changes from 5-8 days. Shipping has become unreliable, and the shipment people do not follow deliver instructions at all. I even have video recordings from my doorbell cam of them making rude comments when dropping my packages. It is almost pointless to pay for Prime for the purposes of faster shipping.",1

never had any problems with deliveries and always on time,2
"So completely disappointed in what Amazon has become, which is completely unreliable with shipping, regardless of how you place your order. We placed a very large order before our vacation and had requested that our products be delivered on the same day in 1 package, as an Amazon prime member. The website stated that our products had been delivered when they had not actually arrived. When we called to see what the problem was, our order was cancelled leaving us scrambling to find the items we had ordered, the day before we leave. I have been a prime member for YEARS and have experienced this same problem too many times and should have known better than to trust this company. I will NEVER order from Amazon again and will be cancelling my prime membership. The stress that their lack of efficiency has created is not worth it to me. We will shop elsewhere. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Get your act together Amazon!!! People depend on you and you are FAILING!!!",0

"The very worst!  They sent me an email regarding recalled products and to contact customer service for a refund.

(had to ping Bezos- yes, he is available- or his office is, unlike most CEOs...) 3-4x to fix issues caused by my ip bouncing all over the states.corporate responce -once you get it- is decent. customer support doesnt know which language you speak half the time(1and1 fr email server didnt help).shipping from some merchants is like snake oil for some reason. ask for nose nettle and you'll see what I mean. can hardly fault amazon for that.however the DRM has got to go. too many issues with kindles and resetting them and not working stuff that DRM is making you buy all over- im not happy about that.+1 is that the kindle functions- when the cord is modified- as an original xbox memory card.",1

"I use Amazon a lot. Their customer support is great, but increasingly I’m finding it time-consuming and frustrating to sift through all the “sponsored” and cheaply made Chinese items. Even if I search for Made in USA, the Chinese stuff shows up first. ",1

"I normally find Amazon to be a good company to shop with. However, I bought a used Nintendo Switch Lite that came not working from Amazon Warehouse specifically. Upon setting up a return, I see they aren’t refunding the full price of the item. This simply isn’t fair business. I hope to buy elsewhere in the future. Update: I was refunded the full price minus shipping. While this is partially unfair since the item didn’t power on, I found it was an acceptable outcome, and will continue to shop on Amazon. I probably won’t buy used items there though. I’m also adding a star to the review (from 3/5 to 4/5). Another update: I’m no longer going to be shopping on Amazon. They sent me the wrong size shirt and no one is home when trying to correct things. While I was able to get a refund on one mis-sized shirt, I am thinking the other shirt I ordered will be incorrect sized as well. Both shirts were print on demand. A size that is wrong happens, the problem is that I literally have no one to contact in this situation. One terrible experience A final update: I am back shopping with Amazon. Just be aware, from my experience, it’s not possible to speak to a representative.",2
Customer service was horrible guy called Aziz when constantly asked put me onto a manager he said then I am the manager when clearly he was not... amazon clearly states on their page that if an item has not been delivered in the guaranteed time frame they said it would be delivered in they are supposed to compensate their customers... I got told no I was lying and to send their customer service a link.. ? Maybe read into your own policy's before you turn people down. Still waiting on my orders... with 0 help horrible staff,0

"I love Amazon. They have a nice selection of products. I broke a cell phone and had to replace the screen. I was able to order a replacement screen kit for under $10. Shipping time was a little longer than I would have hoped for, but I did receive my item.  I was also amazed with the list of resources, when I was researching the kit, it had a list of ""How To"" videos. I found that very helpful.",2
"I've been a prime member like forever. This past year, numerous orders have taken a week or longer, when said to be delivered within 2-3 days. Some I was able to cancel, others could not be cancelled. Also, more and more packages are damaged or torn open. I even received one order (vitamins) where the envelope was EMPTY and looked like it was never sealed. It's been pretty aggravating...",1
Amazon cannot provide reliable customer service that will not lie to you. They qithold my packages for absolutely no reason and then garuntee my package here on the same day and it never shows up. I can never get any answers out of their rediculous customer service team other than it's not my fault and we are too lazy to do their jobs.,0
Never had any problems with using Amazon. The items seem to be better quality than Ebay in general. The buying process is easy and enjoyable.,2
"Ordered a battery charger for same day delivery, waited all afternoon and evening and the parcel never turned up.Got an apology from the agent and told it would be sent the next day (today). today i get a message saying i will not recieve it till friday.I ended up cancelling the order nad will be closing my amazon account as soon as the refund is made.Its happened to me 3 times now, if they cant keep there promises then they shouldnt commit in the first place.",0

"Worst customer service ever !!!! I order some protein and when it arrived, it was not the one I ordered. I contacted Amazon who told me to send it back and they will send out a replacement and refund. Was told it would be delivered on Sat 27 Nov, said online I had been dispatched. So then got a email saying delivery delayed and will be delivered as soon a possible ?? Contacted customer service and they just fobbed me off with excuses and told me I just have to wait !  They couldn’t close down the chat quick enough. Absolute disgusting customer service.  Not the first time this has happened to me.",0
"Amazon has certain pluses about it, but like many large companies they tend to overlook customer assistance. I waited 1 1/2 weeks for a replacement item before I called them only to find out they forgot to send it. Really? How does this even happen?",1
"BEST. WEBSITE. EVER. If I want to buy anything accept for food and phones, I go here. Best prices you can find anywhere.",2
"You can find just about anything on Amazon.  Love the site.  Easy to use.  If any problems with an order, always easily resolved.",2
"I haven’t had a terrible usage but I also haven’t ever had a great usage with Amazon. It’s solid if you need something within a few days and you don’t have time to go to the store, but only if you actually order though Amazon and not one of the other sellers on the platform. Those are hit or miss, some are reliable and some are not.",1
"It's no doubt that amazon has a very good reputation for their large product choice, competitive prices and efficient delivery system. They have the best delivery system i've experienced. So 100% confidence in shopping on amazon's site.",2
I always buy there- always on time with great prices,2
Brilliant next day delivery service with plenty of variety to choose from no matter what your looking for,2
I have to say amazon did a fine job in retuning an items.I can see are not perfect..but this time they did well. Fruugo in the other hand never did.,1
They are horrible . Full of fake reviews. New items arrived used and cost more than brick and mortar.,0

Good one... Products are acceptable,1
Amazon.com big thank you. The self publishing journey with you has been wonderful.,2

I've ordered books from here several times and overall it's ok. But the shipping if very expensive and long,1
"Not much decent , late order",1
"Can't fault them on customer service, the only reason I have given them 4* instead of 5 is because they don't pay tax.",2
I'm actually happy with it. Hope this continues.,2
Best customer service,2
"Amazon engages in wholesale fraud and the FTC and courts need to act.  Amazon profits from fraudulent sales when customers fail to jump through the hoops to obtain a refund and Amazon is a party to this rampant fraud by falsely asserting to customers that items never sent have instead been ""Shipped"" and that they are ""On their way, but running late"".  Amazon told me that and when I clicked ""Track Package"", Amazon suggested that I call the USPS and provided its phone number -- with no tracking information whatsoever!  Ever wonder why it's impossible to get through to the USPS on the phone?",0
Recieved quickly but the package was not good,2
"I would give 5 stars and here’s why I’m not. I’ve been using amazon for several years now and they have been great! Especially with prime. Now, here recently they have started delivering packages with their blue or white vans. Every since they started,  I’ve had quite a few issues! I’ve have packages that never showed and had to end up getting my money back or have them resend it. Claiming that my house was not accessible! I’ve been staying here for over a year and NEVER have I had an issue until they started using the random people in these vans! I checked videos from the cameras around my house and it showed where these people are throwing my packages!! I wish I could post the videos!!! Come on amazon you have to do better!",1
It's really hard to return items I almost rather take the loss on the average purchase,1
My package was supposed to be delivered on Sunday which has not arrived yet. I keep getting is excuses when I call. This is highly frustating and worst service i ever had with Amazon. Please do not use amazon services for delivery since their agent might steal the products order by customers like us and they customers have to call amazon and inquire about products.,0
"HORRIBLE service! Never got two of the items I had ordered on 4/5 that was supposed to be here by the next day 4/6. By 4/12 I had contacted them TWICE asking what's going on after I had gotten a notice that the delivery had been CANCELED as I did NOT cancel the order. The 1st time I contacted them and asked them why the order had been canceled they claimed the order was NOT canceled and that I should get it soon (LMAO YEAH RIGHT). even though my tracking link said otherwise that my order was being sent back to amazon as they had canceled it. 5 DAYS LATER STILL NO DELIVERY. Such a waste of time and they are such CROOKS! Just want your money and think you will forget about it! TOTAL SCAM! I don't see how Amazon is allowed to stay in business with such SHADY business practices. They finally gave me a refund after telling me the order WAS CANCELED like I had told them it was originally, so I could reorder, and they had also told me they would refund me a month's payment of PRIME for my trouble and all the TIME I wasted since the product did NOT come in a timely manner as it did not even come at ALL! Now I am STILL waiting for my refund for THAT. I'm sure I will have to contact them AGAIN about that to get my refund for my membership. Will be canceling membership ASAP as they have gone downhill and cannot support such a crappy business who does NOT EVEN HONOR THEIR OWN PROMISES AND DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. JUST GROSS!  Customers should NOT have to keep at a company over and over again to ensure that the company does WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. Would give ZERO stars if I could!! :/",0
"Further to my last review, Amazon has made some amends so thank you.",1
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1

"They haven't been delivering to where I asked them to and I'm not getting my packages.  Also, we pay for prime but don't ever get our packages in two days. That's frustrating",0
"At one time, Amazon was an efficient, reliable and customer-focused organization. That being said, over the past 24 months, they have become one of the most unreliable and inefficient logistical/retail services I have ever dealt with. Products take longer to arrive when compared to other retailers who don't charge an annual fee and delivery windows are often missed. Customer service agents are based outside of North American and for the most part, are difficult to deal with and generally require further explanation and reiteration to resolve the most basic issues. We have also noticed a steep decline in Amazon's streaming services including the quality and reliability of the content. Lastly, we have found Amazon's customer experience extremely poor. Streaming subscriptions that provided specific movies, that we have maintained for several years are no longer available and can only be ""purchased or rented"". This is extremely poor practice and given that it appears to be (primarily) the movies we have watched, I am inclined to believe that this is an intentional act to force us to buy these movies despite already paying for the subscription. We will be canceling our Prime membership, along with all subscriptions in November when they raise the price.",0
I just love it!I mainly use it to order books,2
"I'd give no stars if that was possible. When you get ripped off by one of their sellers, they don't stand by you. They give you the run around with their claim filing that never amounts to anything. They admit they owe you the money but never credit you. They keep trying to give me a lousy $5 credit to purchase something from their own company. All that means is you now need to spend more money instead of getting your full refund after returning the item.",0
"Ordered PlayStation Portal cost £199. Parcel arrived with a totally different item, informed Amazon straight away and returned incorrect item. Had an illegal transaction from Amazon weeks later they took another £199 from my account for the PS Portal that was NEVER RECEIVED!

"My wife and I had an issue of being charged for Amazon Prime membership when She wasn't a Prime member. We noticed the charge after it made that checking account overdraft and, get a $29.00 overdraft fee. We then back tracked how long it had been happening. It happened for seven months. She contacted customer service and spoke to a man named Jake. He was very courteous and compassionately professional with his behavior. He fully reimbursed us for the mistake plus the overdraft fee. I respectfully say thank you for your great customer service representatives. 5 stars indeed.",2
"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was fine timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer support, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your support is no longer acceptable.",1
i have found something that amazon don't sell.i am a laryngectomee and i was after a larysnorkel freedom so i could go swimming again but i can't find on anywhere and even on the lary page i can't even pay for it so if amazon don't sell one then i give up but other wise its a decent firm to buy from,1
I've got a burst tyre so needed an air compressor to see if i can crawl to a garage for a new tyre. Took three days to arrive. Tracked them online. Guy big grin on his face when i said there tracking was good. Made a comment on notice i put on front door for friend in case i was not in. Delivery man wears bright fluorescent  yellow. Makes a trite comment and still grinning walks away. Now i have to see if i can repair car.     ,0
"Meh, it was alright. Overall am happy, expect for a few orders. ",1
Visiting Amazon website is a pleasure--almost too tempting. It's easy to find what you are looking for & many items are delivered without charge. I like being able to find pre-owned books at bargain prices & being offered suggestions for what might interest me. Friends & relatives might tire of my enthusiasm if they were not as keen on Amazon as I am.,2
Excellent service and prompt delivery. Secure packing.,2
If you want an item it will always be found at Amazon. There shipping is always reasonable and on time. ,2

Amazon is the premier marketplace for all your shopping needs ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!,2
"I find if what you order is from Amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly, but if it's from a third party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated shipment time and that is what lowers the rating in my view.",1
"Amazon Prime. It's fine when they have the item in stock and you are prepared to wait until the end of the day.Recent orders - My keyboard broke, so when asked if I wanted shipment morning I said yes please. Got a message late morning saying couldn't deliver, nobody at home. This is code for ""you live off my route, and I have too many parcels to deliver, so I will pretend you weren't in"". Liars. So instead I received it at the end of the following day.Next one - I ordered an item that said it would be delivered next day from their website. An hour later I get a message saying that the item would be delivered in 11 days time. So I cancelled the order, and my money will be returned in about a week and a half. Amazon must have known that they had no stock, their stock must be computerised for the robots to be able to fetch it off the shelves. SO liars again. When you are paying an extra £90 a year for next day shipment, this kind of behaviour sours the relationship.Next problem - you cannot complain by chat about an order you have cancelled. So I asked for a call and was called by a young woman the other side of the world, for whom English was guesswork. But then I don't speak Phillippino either. Waste of my time again.",1
"Great company, can get almost anything way cheaper than most companies, quick shipment too.My only issue is the drivers.....never ring the bell and dump stuff at the door in open view as late as 8pm! Employ staff who respect the fact they have a job.",1
"Awwww, so ordinary interaction with them. Paid online and got nothing!!!!",1
Amazon does not ship items when they say they will be delivered. They were great  but now less than good. If you mention them in a negative review it’s deleted. They now are as bad as physically shopping in side at Walmart.,0
"Amazing full stop. Amazing prices, amazing shipping time, amazing support services, amazing site, amazing products..........",2
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a order, they take away the packaging from their last order and use it again.",1
"Once I went through everything you have to go through to speak with a real person, I spent over 2 hours with a very nice amazon rep and a few others who helped me fix the many, many reasons I wasn't able to log in to my own account. Email updates, phone not even receiving the code sent via text to enter in order to be able to edit my info. (Couldn't update my phone number to log in because they kept insisting I verify my old phone number through a text sent to the number I no longer have!)  Or the password not accepted because it's in use (because it's mine) even though it's current. Yes, it was both an adventure and a huge undertaking requiring a team of experts to cut through all the engineered obstacles in place to keep someone out. (Unfortunately that someone today was me.)  She was very nice and they all stuck with it and helped me. Very nice people once you can reach them.  😊",1

Amazon are thieves. Recently I was charged monthly for 4 months for prime services on a US account that I've never used or setup. I have UK based acccount.

"Today being stalked by Amazon. Sending me MENS VANS SKATEBOARDING SHOES ONTO MY PHONE. I am sick to death of Amazon stalking me on my phone 😭😭😭😭😭 I continue having complications with both talking to any English speaking CSR and getting rudely spoken to by foreign people overseas who clearly Do Not Care:( That I am a Prime Member means nothing to Amazon. I have been trying to buy a dog stroller on a payment plan. They approve the payment plan and then proceed to charge my Card for the over $320.00 full price of the dog stroller. The payment plan is to pay for this item month to month. Not all at once. I have bought 2 other items using their month to month plan with no problems. Yet the minute I try to buy this very important item they charge the full price even though I checked Month to month and the agreement shows I will only be charged a fraction of the full price. Zero help from Amazon about this. I contacted Petique the dog stroller makers and all they said was 'Sorry about Amazon,"" So Zero help. Many of my packages get stolen or delivered to completely different cities and I get cruel emails telling me my order has been delivered to me-when in fact it has not. I feel like there is a criminal element to my account because people email me telling me I need to change me mailing delivery instructions just seconds after I place my Amazon order. Also telling me to ""Update your Billing Address"". I have called and emailed Amazon about all of these issues and its always the same 2 voices of 2 men; they are very rude, sarcastic and sounds like a former landlord who did very bad things to me. It has gotten scary ordering anything from Amazon anymore. Amazon also continues sending me Suggestions to buy: MENs Watches. MENs Clothing. MENs Shoes. ALL MENs items. I am a Disabled Woman with Cancer. I have NEVER bought ANY Mens items and have asked them to stop sending me MENs suggestions. It is very disturbing the way they treat me; so badly!

Gifts I ordered for order to family in a different state was left on side apartment door vs. in the lobby. Did not ring my mother's apartment to let her know they were there other times. Yesterday I was expecting a package, it shows delivered and I was fed some excuse by the customer support rep that some ""new drivers"" may be scanning packages of delivered before they are. While this may be a chance due to the holiday season, I am giving them today for the package to show. If it does not, I will be asking for a refund or for the item to be re-sent.",1

"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic items for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer support every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1

They told me I need to get a police report for them , police told me that Amazon need to contact them as it’s there issue as there drivers didn’t deliver , I’ve asked Amazon repeatedly to send me proof ( photo, signature) that item was delivered, they  said they have none. Now because it’s more than sixty days Amazon are saying case closed and I’m not allowed a refund for items I’ve paid for and didn’t receive. Isn’t that theft ??? They drag the process out and don’t get back to you when they say they will do so the case goes over 60 days . Will never in my lifetime purchase anything of them again.",0

Most of the time I no problem with ordering from Amazon.  But I have noticed that if you do not write a favorable review when you are requested to write a review they will come back and say they cannot use it for some reason or another.  How is this honest reviews if you are going to cherry pick which ones you are going to use?  That is not a honest review of the product or how it was delivered.,0

This a bit difficult to write a review as Amazon have many different components on its site I've ordered many things from them some of them fantastic others never again the really two big problems I have is when you ask them not to leave on door steps they do and dont put through letter box as dog will eat it and as the person who is delivering doesn't know what's in the parcel it could be harmful to the animal send I know you need to be over 18 to order and  show you are over  that age but am well over that age but they whould not leave it how stupid,1
"Never had a problem with Amazon before now but just got a message to say that my package is undeliverable due to damage and I'll get a refund,but if the package is damaged I would like the choice myself of inspecting the package and then rejecting it,I ordered demon screen de icer and how do I know that the driver has taken it and damaged the package themselves,won't be using Amazon again",0
"Ordered 3 tier shelf.  They said it was delivered,  & charged my card. I asked to what address? The seller put $58.00 back on card. I then checked Home Depot.  I bought 3 tier shelf for $32.00, free delivery. 4 days it was home.",0
"Had previously left a review puzzled by 2 month non-receipt of an order placed with Amazon UK. When I eventually decided to contact Amazon Customer services, I was surprised how easy it was to get to speak to a human being (inside of 3 minutes). The CS rep understood the issue first time of explaining, had a suggestion to resolve it honouring the special offer price I had originally ordered at, and sorted it out in minutes. Well done Abdallah -restored my faith in Amazon first go.",2
Every order directly from Amazon is a great experience.,2

"Amazon customer service doesnt even deserve 1 star. My fiance and I ordered decorations for our wedding next month, and they delivered it to the wrong address. They offered to refund to a gift card to re order. Well we did and that didnt make it either. Now we are to the point thst we will never use amazon again, and they wont refund my money back to my original account, they want to instead send another gift card. My fiance has been on the phone for the past 2 days trying to resolve this and get our money back and they refuse to refund my money back to my bank. Poor service lost this customer and family for life.  F#&* you Amazon.",0
"As with most Amazon customers I use them a lot because they carry such a wide variety of items and frequently I can find items on Amazon that could take me hours or days of shopping in stores.  But there are these aggravating issues: (1) Their auto packing tosses items into one huge box, frequently with insufficient packing materials, and I have had so many broken items I no longer order items such as prime pantry (2) Because they do put as much as possible in one box it is frequently too heavy for me to handle and is frequently put in front of my door so I cannot open the door and have to walk around the house to move it to the other side, which any sensible shipment person would realize (3) Amazon's newer shipment support that I guess is avoid using the post office involves a number of different carriers, some of which are so poor that I have to call customer support...once because an item was just tossed into a snow bank on my driveway, another when it was tossed onto a dark driveway where it was smashed, or I suddenly got a notice that no one was there to accept the package and I NEVER changed from unattended package instructions (4) sometimes the shipment person leaves the package at my back door, where it does not occur to me to search for packages, so sometimes it is there for a few days before I realize it was delivered (5)when you are expected to say why you are returning an item you get a list of options that for me have seldom included any item connected with why I am returning it so I just mark off any one of them and hope for the best (5) if you ever get an email address or phone no. for Amazon customer support cling onto it because if you try to get that by an inquiry on the Amazon search you will never find it there.  All of these negatives have led to my checking with EBay now and ordering there when they have the same items, which increasingly they do.",1
This is a minus 10 review rating. I ordered 2 items for delivery today and although they haven't arrived their status shows as delivered. Customer services say I have to wait another 2days for my order to arrive. What is the point of having amazon prime if I cannot choose the delivery I want?,0
"Pre ordered Dying Light 2, hasn't arrived on the release date, telling me it could take until the 10th February to arrive. Never using this again.",0
"Daniel from customer service helped us with our Hoover issue. Extremely kind & sorted out issue within 15 minutes. Thanks for your support and help Daniel, you’ve done such a great job 👍",2
"I ordered two chairs on Amazon and used my Amazon credit card. When I posted a review about the poor quality the chairs were and how poorly Amazon’s customer service behaved, they refused to post my review. They’ve posted every other review that I’ve made whether it was favorable or unfavorable about the item. However when it was unfavorable to them, they refuse to post it. Be very careful with Amazon and their credit card. With any other credit card you can dispute a charge but with Amazon credit card they won’t even answer the phone. The chairs were of poor quality and very difficult to put together. I requested the seller replace only one of the chairs because that was the only one that was broken upon delivery. They responded immediately that they would make it right and then they ignored my next three requests. So I tried to deal with Amazon directly and submitted a dispute and they totally blew me off. They said they get back with me in a week and I never heard from them. I placed another dispute and same process. So then I tried through the Amazon credit card and I couldn’t even get a customer service rep on the phone. And there’s no way to dispute a charge online. I will certainly never use my Amazon credit card again. While Amazon has pretty much everything you could want, they can’t behave as though you don’t matter at all.",0
"Lately the chat is in India. No matter what your concern, they cut and paste nonsense as a reply. They always insist they will take care of the problem and don't. Just get rid of the chat, Amazon, instead of having this charade.",0
An online sales company that supposedly guides buyers with lists of product reviews.I wonder how many of these reviews are bogus as I keep having mine refused due to my telling the truth about how poor the service was.,0
"No proper complaints procedure. The customer is not valued, and customer service is non-existent. Items go missing, returns are problematic, refunds are promised, but never delivered. The couriers damage the parcels without care. The products are often cheaper elsewhere. I don't know what I was thinking of when signing up to their free trial because the missing items were far from free. It was a learning experience and the lesson learned was don't use Amazon.",0
"new to trust pilot, i like it very much.had amazon prime for some time, decent most of the time.",1
Whats the point in leaving a review of Amazon on its own website as requested only for it to be rejected because it was negative.  Did you know it will only accept and display only positive reviews of itself in which case the reviews Amazon display are totally unrepresentative of the real situationNow you know why on its own website 'Amazon' has a 100% feedback.   Lets not mention the ones it rejected.,0
I ordered a squishmallow dinosaur from here for my friends birthday. when it came in the mail it wasn’t even big it was flat and felt like it didn’t have any stuffing. I am disappointed in my purchase the way it came.,0

"I ordered a walking aid through Amazon December 17 and was was to be delivered in January.  I kept getting notified it was running late, then I was told it was stuck in Customs in New York,  There has been no further contact from Amazon.  I don't want the $220 back I NEED the aid to walk.  I have been bed ridden almost 2 years from a total knee that became infected and I have had 5 surgeries.  I need the aid to get back on my feet.",0
"Only problem is 1)they're becoming a monopoly; 2) they charge too much to join them to get discounts on items & offer free shipping; 3) when they send an offer of $1,000 gift card by just answering a few questions. no matter how you answer the questions you are bombarded w/phone calls from companies of every area their questions are in. The calls start very early in the a. m. & continue all day. Every day for months. Never received the gift card; 4) search & you fnd other companies that offer items for less & offer free shipping without having to join at all 5) customer assistance at the end of my free week or month (i don't remember now) were very kind in cancelling my new account & graciously refunding me my money they automaically when i forgot the date of my free trial.",1
"Lately Amazon has been doing great. They have managed to get my items to me on time. Previously, it was like everything I purchased was coming late. Today, I get a message that my package will be late. Please, let's not start this cycle again. I'm leaving a review based on the company itself. I would like to make a suggestion. When, a Primes member orders items within a certain time frame to have them delivered by a certain day, that's what we expect. Some of us are business owners, work from home, and have projects to complete. Paying for a support just to receive items late is a mute point. Here's my suggestion. For every order a prime member does not receive by the correct time frame indicated, you refund half the purchase price or give a $15 Amazon credit automatically. This means prime members should not have to call in and request this credit. You should have a designated team who keeps track of shipping to ensure orders will be delivered on time and when they are not, you credit the prime membes' account and send the notification of received our items late. How does that sound. Because $5 isn't enough. Truth be told $15 isn't either. However, it's more that $5.",1

"Amazon just makes shopping more enjoyable and life easier! I find nearly everything I ever need — from shoes to paper towels — and they are at my doorstep days later. And whenever (rarely) there have been any problems, their customer service is unbeatable. I fully trust and love the shopping experience, Amazon. Thank you!",2

"The very worst!  They sent me an email regarding recalled products and to contact customer service for a refund.  I contacted customer service and after over an hour of arguing with them, they said that I can't have a refund because the order is expired and it's to late.  Understand that by law they must refund recalled items. The product was purchased in August 2019 and the recall just came out on January 30, 2020 covering January 2013-November 2019.  This, by law, must be refunded, but no, they will let me return it with a restocking fee.  Yes, that is right, a restocking fee for a product that is recalled and they are going to restock it!!!!!!

"I ordered an Amazon Fire stick. It was supposed to be delivered on 6th June 2023.I received an order confirmation on email. It stated the parcel had been delivered at reception. This is somewhat suspect because there is no reception area or anywhere safe to leave it, except with a neighbour. It wasn’t left with one of them. I enquired about this on Amazon chat. To be told the order status was updated too early. Strange… Apologies were given and the new order date was 8th of June 2023.Surprise, surprise…the parcel still didn’t arrive on 8th June. I called Amazon customer assistance and informed them about this. The customer advisor stated they need to speak to their manager. I explained they are in breach of contract the fines never arrived and funds have been taken. I asked for a full refund.To be fair, after the advisor had spoke to their boss. They stated I would have a refund in up to 5 working days. They also told me I could keep the items if they arrived. Of course, the items never arrived.I received a confirmation email of my refund being processed. Thankfully, I received a full refund including the postage and packaging I paid for too. Despite the initial frustration to start with, I’m happy I got a hassle free refund interaction. Although, I am somewhat reluctant to order from Amazon incase a parcel doesn’t arrive again.",1

Excellent service throughout this difficult time. We have received orders with friendly delivery service keeping the social distancing measures. All deliveries have been met on time which we are grateful for.,2
"I tried to do the online chat, and the experience was awful. I'm pretty sure it was AI. I did the Amazon Delivery day, my items were supposed to arrive today, yet they haven't even been shipped yet. And it's not letting me cancel my order. Now I need to wait who knows how long for my items to arrive, before I get my money back.

"My item was delivered to another house and  still don't know where it went, i spent half an hour in the cold trying to find the item in the garden. They often don't deliver right, leave it outside in a paper or cardboard envelope where it gets wet. On the times where u are in and they do knock, they run off leaving it outside, before you can receive the parcel and whether you are in or out it's just left, when u are out they send you an email to say it was handed to resident when it wasn't. The customer service is abysmal! It's impossible to get anyone on the phone and it took me over an hour and a half to get anyone one on the chat bots. Eventually a human in the internet chat offered me a voucher for my terrible experience to which a manager took over and reversed it and said it was tough but they couldn't give me anything. I made a complaint about their customer service and the reply to which I copy below. I since haven't received any refund for the item that wasn't delivered despite as advised requesting. Use this company at your peril. Yes it's slightly cheaper when you don't have any problems but once you take into the delivery costs there's not that much in it. Instead of a corporate entity that doesn't care about its customers Im now going to use independent reliable companies with a good reputation and I  don't mind paying a tiny bit more for.  U can get similar prices for books with forbidden planet where you can get someone on the phone if any problems and you can also shop around with Blackwell's, bookshop org, foyles, hive, Waterstones, wordery, whsmiths and world of books to name a few to try instead....Here's the reply to my complaint quoted from Amazon....HelloI'm Greeshma from Management team.I'm sorry to hear that you had an unsatisfactory experience when you contacted us previously and for any misunderstanding that may have occurred. We appreciate that you took the time to share your concerns about our customer service. I have passed your feedback along to the appropriate people in our company.I'm sorry to hear that you still haven't received your order #202-4980457-7937901, even though the tracking says it's been delivered.I can see that my colleague has issued a replacement for the item to the same address but it has been cancelled.If you'd like to receive a refund instead, please feel free to write us back.After reviewing our previous correspondence with you, please accept my apologies for any misunderstanding caused due to incorrect promise on goodwill gesture.This situation was the result of a human error, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused.We hope you'll understand that we can't offer you any concession in relation to this matter.Rest assured that we're striving to correct any inconsistencies in our processes and those of our carriers, and that your feedback is invaluable to us.I hope that you will allow us another opportunity to prove the quality of our service to you in the future.Warmest regards,Greeshma",0
"Whilst Amazon are good for a quick delivery,  I found that some of the delivery drivers couldn't care if you get your package or not. My last order was left outside for anyone to come along and take it. They didn't even ring my doorbell.",0

Admin thanks ,2
Brilliant good range of products,2
Amazon has always provided great products and at cheapest prices The delivery drivers are the issue not the company itself,2
I just tried to review a product and suggested that perhaps some of the other reviews might not be real as none of the many thousands mentioned the obvious problem I wished to point out. This review was somehow not in line with Amazon guidance. It does make you wonder what it is that they are seeking to hide here?,0
"it is bad enough that your drivers do not allow time for your customers to get to the front door but what is worse is that having rung the bell and immediately walking off they then leave the parcel in full view of the whole street.  No attempt to move it to the side of the door.  I have a porch so no excuse, even though I was home at the time !! Happens time and again",0
I used to shop a lot from amazon but lately I do not like their shipment any more.,1
I never had any bad experiences with amazon. You can find almost anything on their website and it will be shipped to you in excellent condition.,2
I purchased 1 FitproVII on10/12/22 from Amazon. I am a prime member and would expect the watch to last longer than 11 mos.It no longer will turn on nor charge.I also purchased same watch around 03/23 for a family member. My disgust is with the double talk return screen I had to navigate which went nowhere.We are reconsidering our membership unless contacted.,0

Ordered a hand held laser for pain relief represented as a new instead got a previously purchased open box product. Amazon is getting worse with terrible quality control. This is the third time something such as this  has occurred in the previous four months across twenty purchases.,0

"I have been an Amazon customer for many years and also as a Prime customer. The main reason is because of their normally excellent returns policy. I've just started a return for an item within the returns timeline only to have to jump through hoops and several arguments to get them to accept the return.Now the main reason for me to buy from Amazon has been destroyed. Someone needs to change this policy of belligerence. However it won't be me, I'm going to buy from elsewhere. The replacement for this product, is twice the price of the return, but I've placed an order with another retailer now.",0
I will never be purchasing anything ever again from Amazon I will be moving my business to eBay you sent me the wrong sized cat tree I ordered the xxl tree got the large tree 2 different prices and won’t do anything to correct your mistake shame on you Amazon shame on your company I will be contacting the seller to let them know what kind of shady business Amazon runs and they might want to reconsider selling their products with you,0
Amazing company. Would definitely recommend buying stuff from them,2
Huge fan of amazon. Never lets me down,2
great price great offer,2
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime assistance, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1
I ordered this eyelash serum which helped me to grow my eyelashes a little. It came pretty quickly and the seller was very helpful when deciding which product to choose.,2
"Sometimes Amazon customers care is so funny because it a big joke. Whats funnier is the amazon fulfillment service. Sometimes the contact with them kind of rub off on you and you're going to be so much funnier. A CLOWN! There's so much trust that when you return a product and the courier service tells you that they don't accept returns and you'll loose the courier charge and you still want the return so you call an associate they ask you to send the details and tracking id and everything will be fine and you pay the courier charge which they promise, will be returned along with the refund- Chapter I CLOWN IOI ! Then,just like the courier service said,they does not accept the product and blame the courier service. you'll think the courier service is a joke but no baby!You are! -Chapter 2 CLOWN IOI They say the courier service wouldn't have delivery in the area,and when they checked into the courier service, it was shown that the adress,which is of an amazon shipment shown that the adress,which is ot an amazon shipment center,was incorrect,Which you may be dumb enough to believe (jokes on you actually), then the courier service calls you to say that they have attempted delivery (and you realize almost every major courier service would be having delivery near an amazon shipment hub) and says that they are not accepting the return and if the product should be sent back.You call the associate they ask you to sent the details and then try again and promise they ask you to sent the details and then try again and promise you everything will be fixed this time. Voila! -Chapter 3 CLOWN 101. You sent it again. They reject it again . They ask you to take back the product. Then try the return again and loose twice the money. IDK what you think man but this class is fire! I don't think its the iey. IDK what you think man but this class is fire! I don't think its the joker hype but yeah. This is jocker,but you're the the funny one! 🤡PS - The barcode or details was not tampered because the second time is asked the courier service to retry after sticking the printing labels amazon sent me, just in case if the barcode was tampered or something.",0
"Had a parcel delivered by Amazon today , the house number was missing off parcel so driver said he asked a few people if they knew where I lived and then delivered me my parcel, what an absolute star and so nice and polite , well done Amazon",2
Just can't trust the third-party sellers anymore. The quality and customer service is such a crapshoot. And so rarely is anything made in America. Going GLocal is so important and Amazon's model has no interest in that.,0
I have not received my product after given date of delivery now after 4 days of that they are not able to track the product i have made the payment online so now they are not cancelling the order nor giving the refundPlease do take care Amazon has degraded their services and approachU can be easily cheated,0

NOW it's going to arrive after I have left!!!! I used to get shipment the next day for free. This particular order was not for next day but in 2 days. That's when it showed it would be delivered. Now I look and it's going to be delivered in 3 days!!!!! THAT is NOT customer support. We are in the Service Industry not the slow as possible industry. Where is the commitment to support?!?  Now I have no phone case for my phone and I will likely drop it and break it before I ever receive my phone case if it doesn't blow away before I return. NOT happy!

"I've been a Prime customer for somewhere between 7 to 9 years now? Weekly in fact. As a small business person since 1995, and one in hospitality, I deal with human beings of every personality type, many nationalties, backgrounds, etc. What it makes you in the end, is a very fair person who because one is also the target of unfair reviews, you develop a sense of propriety and how to manage issues or turn lemon into lemonade. To this day, Amazon has never attempted to discuss lemons into lemonade. They just like to keep you sucking their sour ways of not dealing with something or admitting they're in the wrong, and ignoring you with just citing vague company policies. So the matter at hand is that I've always left constructive reviews, and rarely have said anything critical or disparaging about a product and as a filmmaker who has actually made a documentary film, I give just as much fairness to filmmakers when reviewing shows or movies I've watched on Amazon. Which is why it made absolutely no sense whatsoever when they cut off my ability to leave any reviews of any kind. And perhaps the ultimate hypocrisy of their system is that with every delivery, they want me to leave reviews about their drivers? Or if I've had other issues with products, and there's been some sort of customer service interaction, they want me to review that? Makes no sense. Now bear in mind I've contacted them over and over on this issue, but each and every time, they've never satisified the original problem with any explanation or any other possible path to recovering or restoring our client to client relationship. Instead, they just want you to bow to them and keep on paying them to be disrespectful of yourself and insult your intelligence through and through. Welcome to corporate America.",0

"I love Amazon. I've never had a problem when ordering items from Amazon itself. I did have a little bit of a mixup once with one of their partner vendors who sent me the wrong product, but everything worked out in the end. One of the reasons I like Amazon is for the reviews.

I called and I found out that they supposedly had sent me an email from Amazon telling me that they had close my account permanently and that I can no longer be a customer .because The email stated I had requested too many refunds, and  the second email stated that I had returned too many items due to their policy requirement that your limit on how many stuff you're allowed to return..I never once received any letter  through the mail letting me know what was going on my with my ordering history, instead amazon took it upon herself to go ahead and permanently close my account...I was Informed by an email and never at one time had I received a phone call from freaky amazon regarding my account...In my email I was informed that since they looked at my ordering history and my account had been closed, I was never allowed to open another account with Amazon and neither was my family members that I lived with..I can't understand how Amazon can close my account because I RETURNED TOO MANY ITEMS, AND REQUESTED TO MANY REFUNDS!!!! Walmart allows you to buy and return without totally banning you from there stores...So. as warnings do not be a customer of freaking Amazon",0

"Lately Amazon has been doing great. They have managed to get my items to me on time. Previously, it was like everything I purchased was coming late. Today, I get a message that my package will be late. Please, let's not start this cycle again. I'm leaving a review based on the company itself. I would like to make a suggestion. When, a Primes member orders items within a certain time frame to have them delivered by a certain day, that's what we expect. Some of us are business owners, work from home, and have projects to complete. Paying for a assistance just to receive items late is a mute point. Here's my suggestion. For every order a prime member does not receive by the correct time frame indicated, you refund half the purchase price or give a $15 Amazon credit automatically. This means prime members should not have to call in and request this credit. You should have a designated team who keeps track of shipping to ensure orders will be delivered on time and when they are not, you credit the prime membes' account and send the notification of received our items late. How does that sound. Because $5 isn't enough. Truth be told $15 isn't either. However, it's more that $5.",1
"Monday 20th December I ordered £525 worth of Amazon Vouchers as a thank you to our volunteers with varying amounts. I received a confirmation email at 12:40pm. At 14:36 I received an email from an Amazon email address I did not recognise and it did not address me by name but said ""Hello"". It also asked me to change my password. I thought this might be a phishing email so I called Amazon to check. They confirmed that this was a genuine email and Amazon had deemed my order as fraudulent.I changed my password only to find that my order had been deleted and along with my card details.I have called Amazon at least 8 times and each time they have read from a script apologising and saying this will be escalated.I purchased from Love2Shop with no problems. I have been an Amazon customer for ages, with Amazon Prime as well.The reason I chose e-vouchers was for the very reason they could be sent electronically!For a huge company like Amazon they could have put a hold on the purchase until they investigated and then removed the hold. As of this moment although they have cancelled my order they have a hold on the monies which shows pending in my account.What would I suggest avoid Amazon e-vouchers if you are purchasing more than one.Customer Service is non existent. Poor, poor service.",0
"one of the best online book stores.. i was looking for a book for my project work,i was recommended to amazon and i got the book there and i am satisfied with how they work.",2
Amazon can be acceptable but when its ordinary its ordinary. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
Amazon has gone downhill. My last several orders have been late and I even had to cancel some. It sucks to see something that's supposedly guaranteed to be delivered by a certain time be tracked to be sitting in their distribution center 30 minutes away but still be delivered three days late. They say you're recourse is to be refunded your delivery fee but it's supposedly free with prime so your stuff is late and you no recourse. Makes me wonder if it's worth keeping my prime membership. Maybe if everybody cancelled their membership they'd get the clue and start doing better.,0
"I tried purchasing a laptop from Amazon (my first purchase ever from Amazon). I paid for fast shipping, but instead Amazon wanted to wait a week to ship my purchase ""because I am a new customer, they have to verify that it is really me"". I decided to cancel the order, because I verified with them over the phone that it was really me, but they have such a bureaucratic system regarding payments that I felt like I was just talking to a wall when speaking to their customer support. Overall, I think Amazon has a decent assistance in some aspects, so that is why they at least get three stars.",1
"This review is split in two: - One for buying direct from Amazon (5* no question, best internet retailer by a mile) - One for buying from Amazon Market place (2* great until you have a problem) Amazon direct:What more is there to say about Amazon, when you order from them directly then it is flawless, any problems are taken away by their outstanding customer service team. They impress me every time. Amazon market place:Essentially one would expect that if you buy it via market place then since it goes through Amazon's engine and has their brand in front of it you'd think they would want to protect this and thus apply pressure to shoddy marketplace practices from some of the retailers. They don't. I bought some headphones, they broke after 3 months, so I requested a return from the company. Initially contact was good, then it all went quiet and I found myself contacting Amazon to request they gave them a bit of a nudge to play ball. Nothing. To cut a long story short, after several attempts with Amazon to get them to earn the cut of the sale that they put through their website I ended up going direct to the manufacturer. They told me that they didn't guarentee anything bought from the marketplace as there were a lot of fakes on there. I asked them to look at my phone anyway and tell me if they were fakes as I would have had far more to go back to Amazon with if they were and pointed out that they were in their first year of service and were guarenteed. Luckily they weren't fakes and they replaced them immediately, but Amazon's halo slipped dramatically for me as a result.  If you want your cut of the money Amazon then sometimes you have to do the dirty work too. If you steer clear of the marketplace then you will never go wrong with the mighty Amazon though.",2
"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great usage with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer support rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer support, is that if you ask a question about a item because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer support reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
"I bought a laptop in Amazon but I received a different product as it didn't have operating system installed while title and description of the product said it had Windows 11.I opened a complaint with customer support and the only option they gave me was the return of the product. After waiting for 15 days I received the refund but was not the whole price I paid for. They charged me 5,50eur for delivery and also 35eur were missing which no one could say the reason. Customer support told me they did the full refund and my bank told me they only received that amount.Then I wrote a review of this product in Amazon explaining all these problems and it wasn't published because of some no-sense restrictions of topics like vendor/prices/stock/packaging/delivery.Amazon service is getting worse and worse and you can't complain anywhere.Ratings and reviews of products can't be trusted because they can censure anything they don't like it without any reason.",0
"Orders always come on time and most have no issues. When I did have one last year, the rep was so nice about it, gave me a refund on the spot! He completely understood where I was coming from, unlike Newegg who takes a good 2 weeks to process a refund, needs an investigations team for the whole thing ,etc. Not to mention the prime with a free 30 day trial! And yes I mean free, no having to buy an annual membership and then you get the trial after that. ( you know who im talking about)",2

average The design of website is not very simple and convenient. It is not a kind of shopping vibe. All of the things are unremarkable.,1
Always order in Amazon their product are excellent and always in time.,2

Ordered the VCR /DVD combo for a great price. Was told shipping would be three days and it end up being five. Overall decent usage.,1
"on order time. When I order sometime for one day order I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
Great site. Best for buying electronics with 2 day shipping,2
"my only bug bear is that the postal costs are sometimes hidden away when you an item that is not sold directly from amazon. soemtimes it can be difficult to work out what you are paying for. there have been times i have thought about buying something only to discover the postal charges were astronomically high in comparison to the cost of the item. I think amazon should rectify this situation where the traders make the product price very low  ie 1p and then build the true cost of the product into the postage costs, so you never really know how much the item costs.",2
"Can't really fault them, aside from the tax dodgyiness.",2
"Amazon can not seem to train their employees to be cable to.place small town deliveries on the correct truck no matter how many times they are contacted about this issue. Each order, you hope it will not spend a week or more traveling back and forth across state before an employee finally knows what they are doing !",0
"I go to Amazon for many online purchases nowadays - on the whole their prices are some of the best, and the choice is excellent. There is a lack of detailed descriptions on some items though, and occasionally you take a gamble that something is the correct dimensions or is exactly the model you are looking for. I would happily recommend it though.",2

"Don't order an Xbox from Amazon. They will send you the wrong item. It's happened to me, and it happened to a friend. I asked for a replacement which they said they would do; then another 'Amazon team' decided they couldn't. Another annoying thing if you want customer service on android, don't bother. The keyboard covers what you are typing on android, making it impossible to type. The only saving grace is they gave me a refund quickly. But this sort of thing shouldn't happen",0
You offer so may products are excellent prices and are so easy to use. Keep up the great work!!,2
Used to be poor service and couldn't care less attitude but they've totally turned themselves around and are now THE place to shop online.,2
"Amazon is so awful, half the stuff in my packages are always missing, items delivered to the wrong houses, entire packages not showing up. Then they try and tell me I’ve had too many refunds on my account… due to them messing up every order I place. Doing my head in",0
"Amazon actually proves that the Customer is no longer the king and that you're only there to give them profits. Here's a breakdown of what Amazon stands for today:1. Absolute Garbage Customer Support, IF at all you do manage to get in touch with one.2. The CS Rep has probably not even seen the face of elementary school since all they do is copy and paste replies from FAQs. I don't know what they're being paid for.3. 99% of the products you receive will be in a flimsy plastic wrapper with absolutely no padding at all and your item will be damaged for sure - All in the name of being Eco Friendly. But then you return and ask for a replacement and repeat, more such materials are wasted. So much for being Eco Friendly. In one instance, I literally had to return an item 8 times before I could get one in working order. Not so Eco friendly, just a diplomatic way of making more profits by saving on packaging costs!4. The CS Reps are powerless, they won't help you because they have no power and those that can do something won't get in touch with you, they're the so called back end and no matter what the rep tells you, no one is passing on your comments to the back end, believe me, I know. THE BIGGEST MISMATCH! It's hilarious!5. Apparently, 95% of the stuff sold on Amazon is low quality sourced from China, India and other third world countries and none of them have any kind of health and safety approvals whatsoever and almost everyone is a seller on Amazon selling whatever garbage they desire. And then you see cases of lead poisoning and other health related issues from using that plastic item you just bought from Amazon. Yes that's the culprit. Try to spend a little more and buy Branded stuff Made in a Developed country with checks and licensing authorities if you have a desire to live longer. If only Amazon was 'responsible' enough to do that for us.6. Packaging Standards are the WORST of any online retailer out there. Their frustration free packaging is a scam, it gives you a lot of frustration when you see broken items inside. There's NO bubble wrap or Foam peanuts or any sort of padding at all. Just the item thrown inside a flimsy polybag or a thin crushed box. I don't know who the wise guy is behind the packaging team but there are times when I receive an item as it is with shipping slip stuck directly on to it and there's no Amazon branded packing at all. Not even that low quality plastic bag. Imagine that!7. You actually end up wasting time and in turn money when you have to return, then reorder and then repeat and then speak to customer rep and then still get no resolution and apparently now their 10 day return is changing into 7 days replacement on some items, clever move. Instead of mending own ways, it's better to screw the customer, Bravo Amazon!8. In the end, it's your money. Either you can give it to support a retailer that keeps growing big and keeps screwing your happiness with no concern for your health, expectations, feedback and your hard earned money OR you can choose to boycott them and support a better company or another retailer instead that might be charging similar or maybe a little higher for the same item but will deliver it right the first time and will also stand behind it's products and be there for it's customers. 9. And since I've been fighting for my rightful money and asking for them to improve their packaging standards and had to constantly return items everytime due to damage or cheap quality, my account was BLACKLISTED by them and now they won't let me open another account or even let me get in touch with them. So much for being the world's largest online retailer. This is their sorry state. The choice is yours, the money is yours...",0
"Amazon is big for a reason. You can pretty much find anything you need here, and get a killer deal. With the Markeplace guarantee, you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter. Comforting when ordering from around the world. I rely on Amazon for household goods, electronics, camera equipment, shoes and clothing, books, and entertainment, everything but husband.",2
Spot on delivery. Excellent customer care,2
"Amazon has delivered to the wrong location numerous amounts of times and even though I am a Prime member, it rarely gets here on the day promised.",1
Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.,1
Since you don't care about free speech for everyone and since you want monopolize everything you can kiss my &$$! I don't need you! All you want is to push democrat rhetoric and suppress any others that don't agree with you. You are the fascist!,0

I love the fact if you get prime you get free shipping.i don’t like there return policy cause to me when a adult toy messes up I wouldn’t want it back as for Amazon they want it sent back. I love that you can get on Amazon and practically get anything you want from toilet paper to motor oil.,1

"I use Amazon a lot. If a package is lost or extremely late I get a refund, and if it ends up arriving I still get to keep it. I do pay for prime but I'm thinking about stopping it because they keep trying to force me into a ""shipping day"" once a week. What's the point in paying for prime then because orders are free over $25(I think... It might be $50) I might as well add to cart until I have that amount.",2

"I buy a LOT of stuff from Amazon, but I've been frustrated for a while now on how their algorithm works for suggestions.  On the main page it recommends even durable items I've already purchased.  It continues to recommend items for months in which I show no interest.  Sometimes I'll click on something because I can't tell what it is from the picture and from then on, I keep getting it recommended.  I have cleared my ""history"" multiple times, but it always goes back to the lame recommendations.  The problem is in the algorithm used for recommendations and should be seriously reviewed.",1
I feel like I got robbed and then the customer service rep hung up on me when I told her that she can't change the definition of a word to fit their needs. Original form of payment means where it originally originated from. What really sucks is they don't even care that I haven't eaten in 2 days. I got other returns that are tied up and literally been tied up for 2 weeks I've been waiting. But yet when I order something they deduct it from my account immediately. Now I have a gift card I have no use for because I'm never doing business with the slimy ass company like Amazon ever again.,0
Amazon  customer care number 8247721430 item related quairy . I have only used amazon prime vendors and have had absolutely no issues. Amazon has always shipped on time and had an easy no hassles return policy if a item was defective. I can’t say the same for other vendors such as Best Buy or Walmart.,1

"I have to give AMAZON two thumbs up (⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2), it is great site to visit, though there are a couple of pitfalls to be cautious with from certain sellers. Generally you're going to be OK.The overall products and operating service are as good as anywhere or better and are backed up by a great Customer Service team. And the delivery service is as good as the courier, everyone's subjected to this standard, ALL sellers and buyers that use online shopping.Give AMAZON a go it's GREAT!",2

There is no reply from seller. So I contacted Amazon Customer Service. There were many problems that happened, they made me feel frustrated. Since CHEVAUHN  helped me with cool temper and patient, I am glad. Now I am waiting for my money to be transferred to my account and waiting the return address from Oasis .

I can see shipping notification on orders I had pending but there is no way to access my account. Support does not reply or acknowledge the problem. I never received any email about my account being disabled.I was happy with amazon but will avoid them like the plague from now on. As soon as they reopen my account I will cancel my prime membership and stop shopping with them.Stay far far away, they become a bunch of scammers, their support is all Indian based, i guess they pay them 0.5$ per hour, they cannot understand english and only copy/paste you standard messages.

I suddenly realised that I canot add comments on the quality os some that I recived and had to return them. I recall 3 times that I left comments amd truly said but Amazon send me a espouse that it canot be published. I wondered at the time of Amazon was trying to protect customers or the businesses that are selling on Amazon. Customers are allowed to leave comments that are honest and true, but Amazon filtering stops negative ones and this is not protecting the customers rights but businesses.

"I've been a customer for a long time, and I will probably keep ordering from them - but not as much as before.For the first time, I wanted to find just items made in the USA.  I want to order some shallow bowls, like pasta bowls - and I don't ever by any dishware made in China.  I heard stories a long time ago that they aren't as careful in regulating the dyes & other ingredients used in dinnerware.  We've all heard about the poisoned dog food from China that killed a few people's dogs.  And the worst was the tainted baby formula that killed Chinese babies.  If they don't care enough to protect their OWN children, then you know they aren't checking too carefully.  I see no way to reliably search for items Made in the USA.  I did find what claimed to be a ""Made in the USA"" section.  Then I typed in dinnerware, and it returned the same dishware that I already knew to be made in China.  Sweese was a brand that came up in Made in America.  And it is clearly Made in China.  And it's so time-consuming.  You have to drill down to the ratings, then search questions to find the info.  After 10 tries in a row with zero results from the USA, I gave up and headed over to WALMART where I was easily able to find what I needed.",1

"Amazon used to be incredibly reliable, consistent, and user-friendly, however lately there's been an exponential increase in wrong deliveries, falsely reported deliveries, and stolen deliveries. I understand things happen, but I believe that when they do, particularly if one customer is experiencing this frequently, the customer should be penalized as little as possible. When voicing these concerns after not receiving the fourth delivery within a month, I was met with condescension and a lack of consideration. I have found their customer representatives to be snarky, demeaning, and unwilling to actually fix the issue or offer compensation. Even their apologies are rude. Sad because this business used to be hospitable and efficient. Seems this conglomerate has gotten larger than they can handle. ",0

I have now cancelled my Amazon account and my Amazon books in protest.

That option? That process? That brain cell to ascertain what the customer is asking?

"Most of Amazon customer service is garbage. They lie to customers over the phone or Amazon account chatting, Amazon should get rid of those rats customer services it's just a waste of $ there are not helpful.",0
Poor customer service!! Their representatives lie plus they STOLE from me!!! Their customer service agents ALWAYS want proof when something is damaged in order to get a refund. Plus they overcharge on items and send items that arrive either damaged or spoiled. My boyfriend nearly died because Amazon did not ship a frozen food item in time. He nearly died of dry ice and botulism poisoning.,0
"I wasn't too happy when they completely ""banned"" sales of Confederate Flags. There is still a large market in sales for this kind of stuff. Whether people agree with it or not. You will always have someone that agrees, as well as disagrees. If you guys decided to ban a piece of American history, then you should ban the sales of Soviet Flags as well. As this flag and its representation goes contrary to how this country was founded. Could be considered very offensive as well amongst many Americans far and wide. This is the United States of America we should have the freedom to chose what we want to buy. I'm sick of businesses going along with this government that thinks they can dictate our lives. I think this was a total mistake Amazon. I hope my opinion is considered.",1
Amazon make it VERY difficult to get free shipment when you spend over £20. It used to be automatically applied. Now you have to get past the constant flogging of Amazon prime go through the shipment option and select free shipment. Not only must you spend a whopping 20 quid you have to avoid getting mugged at the check out for free shipment. How many BILLIONS do this lot need.,1
"The worst company ever, my wife bought a phone from Amazon Italy and she received something else not worth a 10$ while she payed for a phone nearly 1000€, the worst in this scenario that we don't have any possibility to contact them as we don't speak Italian, at the end we asked an italian speaker friend to contact them on her behalf, they said that they will start the investigation, 2 days later she received a mail that her account is suspended, truly the worst company and the worst experience for an online purchase, they don't even deserve a 0.",0
"Overall I do not have a problem with Amazon. Admittedly, the shipment support has been slow since COVID 19,but I can accept that.  I can not accept that there have been two occurrences when I place an order and then the item simply disappears. The item is still for sale but for triple the price or more. Of course when you contact customer support they claim the item is no longer available which is dishonest and untrue. I do not believe this is a way to run a company but perhaps customers matter less when the owner is a billionaire.",1
"Garbage company, the worst customer service, they lie and do not know what they do. If you are lucky not to have issues with shipping, missing packages, wrong or broken defective items, well... it works. Rotten from the top.",0
Sometimes there are a few problems with Amazon.,1
"They have EVERYTHING.  So, I just ask for Amazon GCs for birthdays and Christmas.  Every year I  build up a nice credit balance that I can use anytime.  Also, it can be good for all my friends & family, who are online, so it's easy to just send GCs for birthday gifts.  One-stop, all occasion solution.  I love the reviews; so helpful for making my shopping decisions.",2
The watch i ordered for present was of not fine enough quality wise. I replaced it and bought another item.Amazon you should focus on the goods quality if its original or not.,1
Amazon is really great ecommerce brand i would highly recommend anyone to use it,2
"I like Amazon. It has a lot of selection and you can usually get what you need from there. They have some acceptable offers on there if you get them at the right time. Otherwise, it can be a little dearer than on the high street. You have to be careful with some of the cosmetic goodss, they’re not always legit. But Jeff Bezos is really taking the p**s with the minimum spend if you’re not a prime member. It’s been hiked to £35 spend now. I get that he wants everyone in the world to be on prime. But you’ve got enough money now Bezos, stop ripping us poorer folk off 🤬",1
"Since 2006, we have placed almost a hundred orders with Amazon.com.  To the best of my memory, we have never had to contact customer service, and we have never had any bad experiences with Amazon or with anyone who was selling on Amazon.  They seem to be a very well run company.  I realize that not everyone will have such good luck, but their overall record is probably very good.      For $90 a year we get amazon prime, which means we get free two day shipping on most items that are ordered directly from Amazon.  Since we get the free shipping, it is very difficult for other websites (where we usually have to pay shipping) to compete with Amazon.  That is why we end up placing most of our orders with Amazon.  Amazon prime was a smart idea.      What makes shopping on Amazon such a great experience is that alot of people write reveiws of the products on Amazon.  That helps us alot when we make our buying decisions.      I do not recall any bad experiences with the vendors who sell on the Amazon marketplace.   However, some vendors are slower than others.  If you order from an unfamiliar vendor, be prepared to wait.      So far, we have been very satisfied.   Hope they keep up the good work!",2
"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative usage with Amazon customer support over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a shipment date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer support to get a more specific shipment date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in shipment. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended usage with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
Normally they are okay but ther seller account is a joke. I got charged 19p for I dont know what and just using it is a pain.,1
"I always use this website, the costumer help lines, and phone in case you need it its always available, and really good service!",2
first class company. i've ordered many items from blu rays to av recievers. never had a problem.,2
Customer service is amazing! It is nice being able to resolve order issues with no questions asked. I’ve had maybe 3 issues out of over 1000 orders; such an amazing company.,2
My prime subscription has been cancelled for 3 months and every month the bank charge keeps coming up. The consultants at customer care keep redirecting me to different places but I can't seem to stop the transaction. Canceling an account is the biggest rigmarole and there just doesn't seem to be a solution. I keep being redirected and it feels like it is set up in such a difficult way so that it makes it exhausting for you and eventually you just give up. But at the same time I don't even have access to the account anymore. What a mess.,0
"Again I had a parcel delivered to my home address and again they don’t knock they just leave it on the door step in the looting rain,The drivers are to  lazy to knock or put it in a safe place,Amazon are not a bad company, it’s the drivers who are rubbish",0
BE AWARE WHEN CANCELLING ORDERS. I cancelled an order 6 months ago because it never arrived. Amazon failed to provide a refund and is now refusing to refund because it is past the 30 days. ,0
"If I could give a minus star rating I would. I have been a Prime member since 2014, place over 900 orders. I placed an order, Amazon uses Hermes in the UK for delivery here is the funny part Hermes issues  a tracking number, guess what they cannot  track where my parcel is. Despite several conversations I have had several excuses, Hermes could not find my address, one Customer service agent told me it would  be delivered on the bank holiday, when. I challenged him this was not possible because it was a Bank Holiday in the UK, he then told me Tuesday, never arrived. Escalated to a manage Stuart, from Amazon management team (the highest level of escalation in Amazon), in the UK Scotland, assured me he would call back guess what still waiting for the call back? I think we should start  a movement to boycott Amazon.  Appalling customer service, appalling service",0
"I have Amazon prime which means free shipping benefits.  The shipment of my order used to take about a week to 10 days.  Lately, in order to get free shipping it takes almost 3 weeks with Prime.  If I pay for additional shipment, I get the order within 10 days.  I think Amazon is taking advantage of its customers because of the corona virus.",1
"Still the best. Reliable and consistent. Communication is clear and to the point.  Increasingly my shopping defaults to amazon, during lock down there were my 'go to' for everything. Bezos you are worth all that money",2
"Should be zero stars. Delivery people don't even do the bare minimum of knocking or ringing the doorbell, just leaving packages in plain sight to be stolen. Every once in a while it feels necessary to use them but it is really not worth the risk.",0
"Amazon is big for a reason. You can pretty much find anything you need here, and get a killer deal. With the Markeplace guarantee, you are assured a money back guarantee if your order arrives defective or in an unsatifactory matter. Comforting when ordering from around the world. I rely on Amazon for household goods, electronics, camera equipment, shoes and clothing, books, and entertainment, everything but husband.",2
Awful service. Item didn't arrive even though paid for next day delivery. They offered a refund but no apology. I now have to wait 7 working days for a refund. Will not shop from them again.,0
"Ask them to put parcels in designated safe place, not dump on doorstep because of porch pirates operating in the area, like pushing jelly through a wall trying to communicate with overseas untrained customers services, won't care don't care attitude....",0
Customer Service total waste of time. Chat line asked for someone to call (a number which rings you then plays music - 10 times!) & spent 30 minutes on hold on & off with the agent (whom I could hardly understand) with a nonsense response. Expected much better customer service from Amazon so clearly they have a lot of improvements to do.,0
Products are overall pretty fine. But order is horrible. So many things have not been delivered on time. UPS delivered way better than Uber or prime order trucks. Very frustrating.,1

"What I like about Amazon is the ability to order an item and receive it either the next day or the same day if available. I prefer to keep what I order, but at times, they don't fit or are described inaccurately, and appreciate the ability to return or replace them; however, lately, I've noticed a tactic that I hope is just the left hand not knowing what the right is doing and not a more grim plan to deceive their customers. I purchased an item for close to $300 and realized it did not work for what I needed it to. I printed out the return label and returned it to Kohl's. My funds were refunded and I purchased a unit that was close to $500 that served my purpose. Shortly thereafter, I started receiving emails from Amazon saying I needed to return the item and that they already refunded my money. They also stated that my card would be charged the full amount if not returned by a certain day. I may be incorrect, but Amazon has never refunded me for an item that was not returned. I was able to chat with an Amazon representative, they researched and found that the merchandise was returned and I was good to go. A month later, yesterday, my Prime card was charged the full amount for the item I charged. I'm disputing the charges and waiting to see how Amazon responds to my dispute, that will decide my business further with them.",0
"I really starting to hate amazon! They keep taking charges out of my account that is not even documented in their system. The first charge was $12.99 and the rep did not know where it came from. She then told me I have to dispute it with my bank.But oh, it gets better. I bought an item recently, the money was taken out of my account. I checked my bank account today and guess what?! My account is overdrawn 700 dollars. I called the rep , she said it is your bank letting us know you actually have the money in your account.I am so pissed off 😡🤬😤So everytime I order from amazon I am going to have to dispute the transactions with my bank..yea okAlso, my sister's card info got stolen yesterday. Someone in San Fran decided to buy an airbBNB for a night smh! Now we both had to close our cards. I am sure Amazon is responsible for her card info being stolen.",0
"Amazon is one of the famous companies to provide an online efficient shopping usage. However, when comes to shipment, they do not have the best shipment system. I cannot tell whether my items were stolen or they were not delivered at all equals a scam. I bought items such as ram, facewash, sweatshirt, earplug, gaming controller that were not delivered at all. They are more hesitant to refund or replace an item. I believe there are few articles about amazon supports that you can search about. I am just unsatisfied with amazon's delievery supports.",1
"Amazon Prime. It's fine when they have the item in stock and you are prepared to wait until the end of the day.Recent orders - My keyboard broke, so when asked if I wanted order morning I said yes please. Got a message late morning saying couldn't deliver, nobody at home. This is code for ""you live off my route, and I have too many parcels to deliver, so I will pretend you weren't in"". Liars. So instead I received it at the end of the following day.Next one - I ordered an item that said it would be delivered next day from their website. An hour later I get a message saying that the item would be delivered in 11 days time. So I cancelled the order, and my money will be returned in about a week and a half. Amazon must have known that they had no stock, their stock must be computerised for the robots to be able to fetch it off the shelves. SO liars again. When you are paying an extra £90 a year for next day order, this kind of behaviour sours the relationship.Next problem - you cannot complain by chat about an order you have cancelled. So I asked for a call and was called by a young woman the other side of the world, for whom English was guesswork. But then I don't speak Phillippino either. Waste of my time again.",1
fine usage with amazon but could be better in terms of price transparency. I got charged for the order.,1
Amazon can be fine but when its ordinary its ordinary. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
I just had an amazing experience with Rosalyn. I had a mirror that was damaged and I no longer had the box that it came in. She refunded me regardless even though I couldn’t send it back in the box because it was delivered cracked to me. Great experience and I will most certainly keep ordering through amazon. Thanks Rosalyn!,2
Got my kitty litter delivered but it was clumping kitty litter and we have had ice and snow which is now melting and amazon leaves the kitty litter in the water from melting snow and ice. Why can't the amazon driver knock on the door . I was home but didn't know he showed up so now my kitty litter is useless because it has clumped up . What  is wrong with amazon !,0
"I can't combine shipping.  I was going to buy from a merchant and he couldn't combine shipping.  Shipping was going to be over $100, the items could all fit into the same box.",0
"Amazing, fast delivery. Love prime feature, very money worth since it also gives access to free tv shows, movies and extra features on alexa, next day delivery and more. Always use amazon for it's swift delivery and good quality products.",2
"Amazon non accountabilityAmazon, has been jerking me around for over three months. They don't hv phone support . I hv been waiting for 8 orders Never delivered. Charged me and they are not letting me post about it. There is no way to contact them about. I am thinking they are involve in this spamming and Fraud. There is no accountability for this company. Conversely, Amazon is destroying a lot businesses especially now. Shop anywhere but Amazon!!!",0
"Up until recently, I never had cause to complain about Amazon. Customer support was always attentive to my needs. Then I traded in a new cell phone. I haven't received payment for almost a month now and all I get is give it a few more days. I need the money, but they are the big average and I am just a peon. I dropped prime after over a decade and they lost a decent customer who spent thousands.",1
"My interaction with a missing item was really frustrating, for days nothing happened they didn't even took my case serious. Then day after day I annoyed the hell out of them. I wrote them multiple times a day while complaining. I contacted the shipment company which is in my eyes partly responsible. They ignored me for whole 7 days. I also did contact the manufacturer but Amazon still didn't really feel the pressure. So I decided to annoy again and again and again and again until I had another idea. Let's just directly mail Andy Jassy the ceo of Amazon which I did next. I did mention that in the customer support chat and 10 seconds later I got reconnected to someone from problem prevention or something like that and then I explained to them everything again and then 15 min later I'm not even joking they organized a replacement order just like that. Finally!!!!!? But I have really mixed feelings about all the hassle you have to go through first until you mention Andy Jassy and suddenly everything goes really fast. Don't know how to feel about that hence the 3 stars. You should be like that without that I feel I have to pressure Amazon in such a way and annoy them until something is happening. Being relentless paid off but shouldn't be necessary to be honest",1
This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0
Customer support going downhill. Kind of tired of talking to people overseas who can't vocalize. Selection still great and order quick and cheap.,1
My son ordered a gaming monitor £169 and instead received a watch £30. He had signed for it because you need a code now for anything over £100. We returned the watch and have now had a gaming monitor delivered 5times! They won’t leave it because we have no code which was supposed to be sent but never received for the replacement. Customer service appalling! Now waiting for a refund 🤞🏻all because someone can’t be bothered to send a simple replacement code.,0

"I have never seen such a dumb system on any other shopping site! In the occasionally use where I needed to use Amazon to buy presents quickly I couldn't!!!The reason is that you can't buy without an account, I have two accounts which both got locked when I tried to login! It doesn't say why it's locked but it asks to contact customer service! They have a link for problems with login that gives 4 option on what problem it is, none of them is my problem! After choosing one and contacting customer service they tell me I need to fill in a formulare which I didn't even get. They fill it for me and say that I need to wait, it has been three days now!!!! What kind of company am I dealing with???? All this to buy a child book????Never again!",0
Placed an order in December for a food item. Yesterday (23/2/22) the item was recalled. The food had obviously already been consumed and to which I had food poisoning that week and when recalled there was a risk of “microbiology contamination”. When speaking to Amazon about this and explaining how I was not happy especially since I had to go see a doctor and have time off work. The response I got was “I’m sorry your order hasn’t arrived yet”. No help at all to settle my issue.,0
"Amazon has really dropped the ball this holiday season. The app sent an alert about a package being delayed with no expected shipment date. Upon contacting customer assistance, I was told it would be delivered on time. When it wasn't delivered, I aain contacted customer assistance to be told it would not be delivered until 4 days after Christmas.  I requested a refund at this time and was offered a promotional credit for the inconvenience.  I then contacted customer assistance because the promotional credit was not showing on the account only to find out the credit is only usable if I find and purchase a item sold by Amazon specifically (not a vendor of Amazon). So purchase something I may not want just to use a ""credit"" applied? In other words, give Amazon my money. Getting pretty tired of the ordinary business with Amazon.",1
"For the most part, I love Amazon. They are fine at contacting you on FaceBook because they have blocked my reviews and wanted to know how I can fix that. They were very nice and quickly respond to me on Facebook but they told me to try and fix it with customer assistance. You try to go to the contact us page and you just get sorry something went wrong on our end. No popup chat no phone number. Verry disappointed 😥",1
"I use Amazon a lot. Their customer assistance is great, but increasingly I’m finding it time-consuming and frustrating to sift through all the “sponsored” and cheaply made Chinese items. Even if I search for Made in USA, the Chinese stuff shows up first. ",1
Most of the time I no problem with ordering from Amazon.  But I have noticed that if you do not write a favorable review when you are requested to write a review they will come back and say they cannot use it for some reason or another.  How is this honest reviews if you are going to cherry pick which ones you are going to use?  That is not a honest review of the product or how it was delivered.,0
"Very long history with amazon, bought an item which passed the estimated delivery date, ordered the item on 25th January 2020, estimated delivery date 21st February 2020, today is 22/02/20 item not yet delivered.Contacted Amazon, instead of apologising and refunding me, I was informed that I have to wait for 3 more working days, whilst Amazon debited my account 26th January, no item no money and I am being told to wait, who will pay interest on that money.Very very very poor customer service, the managers are not well trained, the staff are not well trained.",0
"I was looking for iPod touch 3 in 1 chargers for my kids iPod's for Christmas and even though the 'sellers' advertised 'free shipping' or 'shipped in time for Christmas' when I got to check out every time, there was either a $9.00 shipping charge for a $3 charger, OR there was some outrageous shipping date like shipped by December 28th. I settled for paying the extra cost for shipping to get it here on time, but may just stick to craigslist, eBay, or half.com for my next purchase.",1
"I used to love amazon. I've been a solid customer for over 8 years. Probably spend over $5,000 a year with them. More and more with each passing year. Now their support has gotten worse, prices increased, and more and more shipping problems. Amazon get your act together.",1
Amazon is the best retailer ever! One can find all types of products at the lowest possible prices. I've located products on Amazon that I've purchased in other countries easily. Service is quick and reliable. Returns are promptly processed. I love Amazon!,2

"I ordered an item for my granddaughter to use for prom and the reason that I ordered it from Amazon was because I could get it on Wednesday before we needed it on Saturday.  Well as of 6:00 on Friday, it still had not been delivered.  I called customer service and she checked with logistics and they said it was probably lost.  She said that she would refund my money and I told her that was fine as long as she did not cancel the order as there was a slim chance that we might receive the item.  She assured me it would not be cancelled.  Well, the order was cancelled.  I was livid!  Customer service is terrible and apparently cannot speak English good enough to understand what the customer is saying when they say DO NOT cancel the order.  Amazon used to be great but their shipping sucks now!!  Will never order anything important from them again.",0

"I was trying to change my default credit card from Amazon Visa to another credit cared. The site would absolutely not do it. I called customer support and spent one-plus hours on the phone with an impatient, intolerant rep. going over and over the sites and selections I had already tried. It just would not let me enter an alternative credit card. Tonight, I found an agent who stayed with me and found a circuitous way for me to enter my new credit card. She was an angel; the rest of Amazon is an overbearing monopoly which I suspect just did not want me to use a credit card other than its.",1
Just received my new watch. Just love it. It's been very good experiences shopping at Amazon for years.,2
The customer assistance was decent.  The background noise at the call center was horrible.  I couldn't hear myself think when I had to answer the questions.  I felt like someone was shouting over me.  I've designed call centers for years.  I can tell when employees are sitting on top of each other without any sound attenuation.  It made my customer assistance usage really unpleasant.  They need to do better.  They are Amazon and they are taking over the world.  They have money for better call centers.,1
"Mixed purchases, arrived earlier than expected.No problem.thanks",2
Fantastic support and logistics. I order weekly from Amazon and have never been disappointed by them.,2
I enjoy shopping through Amazon. After a few issues with my orders I'm thinking twice about shopping through Amazon. Some sellers you can't get a hold of other's never refund you. I have had at least five ordinary usages with sellers from Amazon. I'm still waiting for refunds from months ago.,1
ok not best  Anymore now  gone down hill,1
"I have been using Amazon more and more. I can always find the products I am wanting. Unusual items can be found and with prime delivery it is hassle free. The app is so easy to use. I love it. Only small downside is that some of the next day deliveries don’t arrive on time however these are few and far between. On occasions I gave gad to contact customer services, they have resolved the issue. Returns are easy. Overall a very happy customer. ",2
Always use Amazon as the prices are always competitive. i was told i would have to wait two weeks for one of my orders but it arrived the next day so i'm very pleased!!,2
i cannot believe my kindle doesn't read .docs . Otherwise it is a fine item.,1

I would not recommend amazon to anyone. I have noticed multiple times they have charged me more than what my order says I will be charged and every time I bring it up they either tell me they didn't make any charges or check with my bank. This time she tried to tell me they didn't take any money so I asked if I could send screenshots because she said the transaction IDs were incorrect I emailed the screenshots to her. Then she came back with that money is just on hold not taken out to call my bank. When your sneaking money from people your scamming them period! Even if it's a dollar here or there.,0

"Abysmal service! They are useless, from the monumental joke that is amazon TV to this shoddy cowboy company that is run by a complete geek worth trillions. Then again you can have a penis and be a woman in this day and age so nothing shocks me. ",0
Most of the products i bought they were ok. Now I made very good reviews on that ! Always make sure that when a driver leaves the package outside my place got also great reviews. But they were some products like in TV. antenna  cheap $25.00 didn’t do much I did return it. And didn’t say nothing bad . Got a different TV antenna cost $60.00 bucks also did not work and said I didn’t like it. Then I get in other of a TV antenna cost $200.00 and nothing less Chanel so i say  the product sucks. They blocked me in got offended. So I was hones with my review as well as with the positive review. So freedom of speech is definitely not allowed in a company I am paying for your salary . So I can’t cancel the account I had requested and donethe procedure of do it ? I want out this compan with all my persona information deleted pls. ,0
Apparently ordering something in November means I don’t get it till th 12th of December but when ordered it was to be delivered by the 5th of December Amazons answer sorry it’s not our problem and we can’t refund you because it is a third party seller not my problem you need to regulate them better and start making sure they do what they say they will or drop them simple but thanks for letting my little girl down for her nativity I’m sure she will be so happy to be the only one without a costume thanks Amazon and as for your customer service guy not helpful,0

"from what I see here, you are all a bit frustrated, first of all, some of you wouldn't last even 2 hours as a courier at Amazon, you don't have the common sense to buy a parcel box, you only know how to complain, you have the impression that you have to let the courier treat you as if you were their boss, you have demands and some of you don't even say thank you for a correct shipment, not to mention those of you who lie that the packages haven't arrived, let the courier lose his job, some ….you are , in your work you will have a share of this",1

Right now the thing I am most angry about is the $700 I paid for my HP360 laptop.  If you don't know what a 360 is   It's one of the laptops that folds all the way backward and can become a tablet. I bought it last August. When UPS delivered it, the box was partially opened and it loomed beat up. I wasn't even home to use it for about 3 months and I've used it a grand total of about 6 times!  It's gotten worse and worse every time I've gone to use it and this morning I try to use it - and NOTHING!  Nothing at all. Not a dam thing! It won't even load. I can't open a single ap and im freaking out. So I guess I'm going to call Amazon, tho I don't know why.  Whoever answers the phone will barely speak English I won't be able to understand them and vice versa. Then they'll tell me what I already know because I just looked it up on my phone and I tried to post a bad review on Amazon -  They're not even selling that computer anymore they won't allow me to post a review at all when I try to it brings me to my other orders instead and it says it's past the return and customer help date.  So something tells me I bought a lemon and THEY KNOW IT! I need this computer.  And I was so happy when I got it. It's red, my favorite color. It's just what I wanted...we work hard for our money just for them to steal it from us. I don't hate a lot but I really hate Amazon.",0
Amazon knows what you like and have great services very impressed,2
"Sent the wrong item repeatably and did nothing to resolve the issue, except ask me to return the item at my expense, useless incompetent staff.",0

"Seeing Amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different types of fines. The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty fines or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of fines act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty fines. Also average if you have to return damaged fines, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded order so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a fine way for a company to work.",1
"great experience , although order arrived a little late",2
"I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.",1
"It's OK, but you're just giving Bezos more money.",1
Amazon are excellent for what you need but don't agree when parcel left on step or put inside bins or in your electric box other than that very good site,2
Earlier I was happy but this time my parcel come late and the goods's price was a lot a bit high.,1
"Amazon delivery is ineffective. nothing has been done to correct the issue for deliveries being made contrary to the delivery instructions in my profile. Four out of five (now) deliveries are being made incorrectly. Contacting Amazon and reporting this is a waste of time. I did it yesterday, and again today. No effect. Deliveries still made incorrectly.No other option has been presented.This ineptitude has caused me to stop using this service and company",0
Always had good customer service with Amazon.. products aren’t always the best but fair for the prices,2
I've ordered books from here several times and overall it's ok. But the shipping if very expensive and long,1
"They have reliable drivers masked by rude, and drivers that totally dis respect me as a customer. Throwing parcels over or by back gate saying handed to me in person. Yesterday had message saying parcel delivered to my safe place. Not there. Told to knock at doors to find it.",1
"Don't know what else to say. Living in New York City right next to a shipping center means fast shipping for everything I order. Same day if not next day for most items. Sometimes I think this is a bad thing as it makes me buy so much crap I probably don't need. But if you need something fast, this is the only site you need.",2
"Zero customer service.  You cannot reach them by phone or email.  I challenged charges on my credit card account from Amazon.Their response was to “suspend” my account.  Now I cannot even access my Kindle books that I paid for, on my Kindle that I also paid for.",0
If I could give 0 stars I would. Waited in all day to be told at 16.00 delivery would not be coming.  Cancelled it and requested a refund. 2 weeks later still no refund so finally managed to speak to them.  They have now processed my refund so will be another week at least.  Avoid at all costs.,0
"I think Amazon Prime Video is going downhill. It links to netflix but I've been finding more and more cases of recommended watches show up but when you click on 'watch on Netflix' the programme either doesn't exist on Netflix, or it takes you to a film/programme with exactly the same name on Netflix (but not the one advertised). If it doesn't exist then don't promote it... It makes it look like there is more good stuff to watch than there really is. Not very ethical and clearly not being properly monitored by Amazon.",0
"Wow, what a great experience I had with you guys! I ordered a Boltune Bluetooth Earphones V5.0 and am so impressed with the fast shipping, the product itself and the gift card worth 20 USD that came with it. It was so nice to see such a personalized touch. I'll be sure to tell my kite surf friends about my online shopping experience. Keep up the good work. I will definitely buy from you again.",2
"Bought a selection of items for family back home, all set to deliver to the UK (was sure i did this through Amazon.co.uk)Find out that somewhere along the way they randomly charged me 92.50 for Amazon Prime. Once i spent 30 mins and a couple of transfers on the phone, i got it refunded, but its just as well i checked my pending transactions online otherwise I might never have know they'd charged me, for a Prime account i dont have too. Fast resolve but shouldnt happen in the first place with this much money.",1
"I would not suggest even for this one star, I don’t have an zero option and hence this star. Worst ever. They don’t deliver half of the products and say that we are responsible for the product even if it is not delivered. I have decided to stop shopping with amazon",0

Unclear with its billing. Had to jump through major hoops to get money refunded from charges I did not authorize.,0
"Items sold are original and authenticated. We can blindly trust on amazon. Also the transition period of fines generally remains short. But, one demerit what I observed is, the PRICE of the items which remains a little more than the other shopping sites like flipkart and paytm. Even in the sale(offer) period, the price of various items is raised to fill up the discount.",1
"Quick delivery with prime, always easy returns, great products and service.",2

"Absolutely lazy, rude and not caring customer support. They'll block your account even you're the rightful owner of the account, if they feel like it.",0
Have put one star back for Clarissa the only agent who cared and wanted to make things right. After id been online constant for over 4hours being palmed off to next agent she pleaded with me to stay on and she would make it right. So took 5 hours in total but she did true to her word as I found on waking up this morning so she deserves a raise but the rest of the team CS And Co can rot. And I've well and truly been put off buying other items I had intended too Awful customer support with foreign call centres and chat finally corrected by a Amazing clarissa as stated above after a very long time of needing help,1
I ordered a squishmallow dinosaur from here for my friends birthday. when it came in the mail it wasn’t even big it was flat and felt like it didn’t have any stuffing. I am disappointed in my purchase the way it came.,0
"The company is so big and offers so many different supports in so many locations that it is quite difficult to give it one general grade.The most frequent problem I had was with the couriers, who often are unable to follow the shipment instructions or do not even attempt to deliver the item.However, the customer support is always helpful. They always throw a few pounds sweetener or a free month of Prime membership. Occasionally I get to keep the wrong item I received - they refund it but ask me to NOT send it back. When their pick up courier was consistently failing to arrive, they offered a full refund for sending the parcel myself via whatever courier I want.",1
"My account was blocked just after moving o the UK and getting a prime subscription. They tell me to call customer service (US number), I did and they cannot find my account. They tell me to call Amazon NL (where my account is originally from) but there is no number. After insisting the guy gives me a random Belgium number +3222012345 that doesn't seem to be the right one.What a mess! Can you solve it please?",0
"I've had an average interaction with Amazon.com. The site offers a vast selection of items, and it's generally easy to find what I'm looking for. However, there have been a few instances where the shipment was delayed, which was quite frustrating.The customer assistance is decent, but there have been times when resolving issues took longer than expected. Prices are usually competitive, but occasionally I find better deals elsewhere. Overall, Amazon.com is convenient for many purchases, but there is definitely room for improvement in their shipment and customer support assistances.",1

"I would put a zero if I could. First of all I have multiple packages together so I choose the latest day for my delivery to get here so that all of it would be together. They keep saying that one of my packages will get here today but the other two are already out for delivery and the other one is not even out. This is ridiculous. If they can’t deliver on the dates that THEY provided, they need to give accurate days of when it will actually get here. This has happened twice, they had plenty of time to ship it but they waited till the morning of the day that it is supposed to be delivered to ship it.",0
"normally acceptable, but recently shipping was very poor. Poorly packaged boxes, nothing in boxes to keep heavy things from crashing into fragile things",1
Very happy with the recent DVD promotions.  The live chat feature helped me know what I could order and the delivered products exceeded my expecatations.  Thank you!,2

amazon is so decent on getting stuff on time but there order is abit slow but decent rang of items are decent,1
"Legit, it is what it seems.",2
My packages have been late at least 6 times this month and another 4 the month before. I think it’s excessive to be late. It’s guaranteed to get there on that date as instructed by them. They make up they needed to check another fulfillment center which is ridiculous then don’t put that it’s available. I have several fulfillment centers and they don’t deliver on time.,0
"They have EVERYTHING.  So, I just ask for Amazon GCs for birthdays and Christmas.  Every year I  build up a nice credit balance that I can use anytime.  Also, it can be good for all my friends & family, who are online, so it's easy to just send GCs for birthday gifts.  One-stop, all occasion solution.  I love the reviews; so helpful for making my shopping decisions.",2
Shop a lot on Amazon...was looking at cosylife walkie talkies and 5 days ago they cost £16.50 then 2 days later £17.00then £19.50 then £21.00 today they are £22.50.  I notified amazon about this and they were very decent to give me £10 voucher as they have no say on 3rd company pricing.I love amazon but companies doing this are not fine.I was hoping to get them for decent price on pay day they will be £30 by then haha.,1
"Order item for Christmas present was in on the day item was going to delivered and next thing during the day I got notification item deliveredOpened the door nothing. Contacted customer service and was told sometimes they scan items as delivered but still on van for the day,, (think I am stupid) and was told I had to wait 3 days and get back if not arrived. So received a email saying after investigating the matter they deemed item was delivered and I must go to the police Yes amazon is robbing people's parcels and saying they have been deliveredThey need to spot check there drivers to see what they doAnd now waste police time every time you don't receive your items to get a crime reference number thanks amazon for messing up my ChristmasMaybe put body cams on them",0

"I order a lot of books for my business. I love to shop on Amazon because I can find the books I need and search by price, so that I can find the book at rock bottom prices. I also find it extremely helpful that Amazon includes pretty extensive details about the book, such as the number of pages, a description, all of the sellers that offer the book (new and used), and even supplies reviews from users like me, all on one page.",2
"A nice buying site with great customer service, I love its service and I can always find something I like there!",2

"First time I have ordered, paid for and used Amazon.com. Purchased a descendants doll (hard to find in the uk) to arrive in time for daughters birthday. Got a message the day after the delivery was due to say it was going to be delayed. Next message to say they have refunded the money paid as they can not deliver the item. Sent an email to advise this was really poor service and was offered £10 credit and fast free shipping on next purchase. 1: do you think I wonder order again from you and 2: don’t think my daughter will take that as consolation for the gift she was expecting. Really disappointed and 1 star is a very generous rating.",0
"Two weeks ago I placed an order which was confirmed immediately after. However, the following day I received an email claiming there was unusual activity on my account so it was put on a temporary hold. I was promised a review within 24 hours but now, two weeks later, nothing has happened. So, I created a new account and placed an order but now the same thing has happened. There is no email address or local number I can phone without spending a fortune on an overseas call. I am so frustrated and if I could get my purchase somewhere else there's no doubt I would not be attempting to shop with Amazon.",0
"Very nice experience, in and out no time killers here! The staff was very polite.",2
"Brilliant value.  Excellent service in the unlikely event that the product needs to be returned or replaced.  Very speedy service.  Fantastic range of products; from buying bargain books several years ago, Amazon is now my first port of call for just about everything - they rarely let me down for choice or competitive price.  If I need to replace my car in the near future  . . . . .",2

Well trusted It made it easy for onlineshopping and probably you'll find anything you are looking for outhere.,2
ordered a stapler and it was supposed to come with a set of staples - the stapler arrived without the staples so not much use really,1
Amazon needs to get there heads out of there asses. Because they lead me to believe I was getting a package on time but it was out of stock and mad me wait 3 weeks believing it was instock.They didn't notify me at all.And when I asked the customer service people each time they would drop me I went through 3 people before I said screw it I'm canceling it.That's the last time I spend 600 bucks for anything on Amazon.,0
How are you I have a small business and I tried to list item for sale on Amazon it was big scam start from the  beginning you have to buy a barcode from company they deal with them Gs1 cost $250 for barcode to list an item you have to go through a lot of Hustle and unwelcome website and if you need help some agent from India or Philippine going to call you back after you send request email because no phone number to call but anyway I finished everything they say  provide them With my tax ID number and it's still not working I don't know why I believe they have the most stupid system in the world now to sell on Amazon you need to ship your product to their warehouse which required another company they provided to come and pick up your shipment which cost me a lot of money and another 10 days waiting with three different appointment and they never show finally they come add pick up my shipment and it's been 8 days and I don't know where is my product so stay away if you want to sell on Amazon stay away,0
I use amazon like most however don't display same day shipment if order by such a time if when ordered in that time you have no intention too than add 2 or 3 days for shipment.  Boxes still take the Michael waste of space half the time small items in huge boxes.,1
I ordered a sandisk 1tb microsd from Amazon and it was perfectly working. The only thing I hate about Amazon is their support which isn't very humanly.,1
"I had been a faithful Amazon customer since the 1990s and rarely had cause for dissatisfaction, until they started using their own couriers. Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no interaction in order. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection. Worst of all, there is no way for me to lodge a complaint except here. Now I try to order ABA: Anywhere But Amazon.",1

Times when my item has not been delivered I get an email to say attempted I ask customer service to try again as was in and they make sure the driver trays again. The delivery service is brilliant, only downside to having prime is not a great selection of films or tv on the prime, but that's not what I got it for.",2

"Amazon is not providing the support I am paying for as a prime member. When searching for a phone case, I was looking for a shipment date that would work before leaving for vacation. NOW it's going to arrive after I have left!!!! I used to get shipment the next day for free. This particular order was not for next day but in 2 days. That's when it showed it would be delivered. Now I look and it's going to be delivered in 3 days!!!!! THAT is NOT customer support. We are in the Service Industry not the slow as possible industry. Where is the commitment to support?!?  Now I have no phone case for my phone and I will likely drop it and break it before I ever receive my phone case if it doesn't blow away before I return. NOT happy! And before you say you can cancel, no, I tried but no they can't accommodate THAT either!!",1
I use Amazon a lot due to convenience. We don’t live close to shopping. Lately they’ve been trying on the same day shipment and it tends to be 3 days. Not impressed. Don’t offer it unless you can execute. The drivers are damaging a lot of items and they’ve been delayed and returned because of it,1
"Prices are still decent but support going downhill. I've used Amazon since late 90s and appreciate many of their innovations. The last four years, I've become increasingly frustrated with inability to contact a human when things go wrong. Items used to be well protected from damage but that stopped about ten years ago and is only getting worse. My goal for the new year is to transfer all purchasing to other sites that still provide excellent customer support and not just 'cheapest'.",1
"Amazon prime is useless, it says next day delivery and item wont be here for another 4 days! Rude customer service, makes up loads of lies. DO NOT USE PRIME.",0
I have always found Amazon to have excellant customer service.Any time if I have had an issue with anything they are straight on it.If I ever need to speak to anyone online always very happy to help.For me this is important and that’s why I shop at Amazon online.,2
"Amazon was able to donate billions of dollars to charity through their smile program. Their CEO, and Board members saw that, and decided to remove smile so they could keep the money instead of donating it to a good cause. Amazon just keeps getting worse, and worse.",0
"I have been a Prime member for many years. I use Amazon for most of my shopping needs except groceries. I haven’t really tried that as an option. They offer a lot for the cost of membership. This includes commercial free music, unlimited photo storage (not including video), free movies and TV shows and two day free shipping.Also, I have never had a problem returning an item. Their customer service is always helpful including their technical support. They stand by what they have represented online. I had an order that showed to be delayed from the promised date, when I called they gave me five dollars off to use as credit; The package actually got there on the original promise date anyway. They also hold their sellers to the same standards. When I had purchased a mattress and adjustable bed from the website and had a problem they told me to call the distributor company and if I was not satisfied with a solution I was to call them back and let them know. For a very large company they operate like a small business with great customer service.",2
I had a parcel delivered recently and the delivery driver stood in the middle of the street and launched my parcel into the doorway. Its on a doorbell camera so it was very clearly seen. I now no longer use Amazon. Luckily for me the item I had ordered did not get damaged just the box. ,0
Bloody love amazon! Especially prime 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼,2
"I really starting to hate amazon! They keep taking charges out of my account that is not even documented in their system. The first charge was $12.99 and the rep did not know where it came from. She then told me I have to dispute it with my bank.But oh, it gets better. I bought an item recently, the money was taken out of my account. I checked my bank account today and guess what?! My account is overdrawn 700 dollars. I called the rep , she said it is your bank letting us know you actually have the money in your account.I am so pissed off 😡🤬😤So everytime I order from amazon I am going to have to dispute the transactions with my bank..yea okAlso, my sister's card info got stolen yesterday. Someone in San Fran decided to buy an airbBNB for a night smh! Now we both had to close our cards. I am sure Amazon is responsible for her card info being stolen.",0

Then the agent I was chatting with who refused to help, stole money out of my gift card balance and refused to put it back unless I gave him my ID and password. They also made a fraudulent charge to my credit card. I was a prime member for ten years, before this. But I unsubscribed and am never shopping here again. Unsafe site that breaks their own terms. I am taking legal action too. ",0

"My son was scammed and ripped off by Amazon!!! In general, I love Amazon and their products and services. But recently my son who is 18 opened an Amazon account and I wanted to teach him how to use and order from Amazon. Of course, we ordered goods like ""warm socks"". A few days later the courier delivered to the wrong address well, according to the photo of the 'proof of delivery' we were able to prove that it was not our address and house and of course it was refund done. A few weeks later we tried to order again exactly the same and guess what, the same again! This time he got a ""suspicious activity warning"" warning on my son's account and I tried to speak to customer service to confirm it wasn't his fault! A few months later he ordered 'headphones' which cost around £100 so guess what, same thing happened again!!! We were at home and no delivery only an email that you received the parcel...?! I called again and told the situation that we did not receive the shipment, I have security camera footage and can send proof that the courier was not at my place at the time. He said wait a few days and maybe the courier will deliver because sometimes the system mistakenly says delivered but they are still on their way. So we waited and called again after a few days. They advised to check the neighbors and come back in 48 hours. After a few days we called again... they said that will investigate and report back. After that call... a few days later my son's account was suspended due to an investigation. Tried to contact again and called like 10 more times trying to figure out what's going on here....asked for a photo of ""Proof of Delivery""....but (still haven't received it yet) ...so they shut down completely account and did not refund because their courier said the package was delivered safely to the location. today I spoke to an amazon ""manager"" who did not help me at all...couldn't give a ''Proof Of Delivery''...and no one can help because the courier said the item was delivered to the address and she can't change anything. The advice was from her... to contact the police...... So my son was left without money and without headphones. Therefore, dear future customers of Amazon....be careful...because if the courier steals from you...amazon will do nothing and you will be left without money and goods...and nothing to prove that it is not your fault. I am very disappointed with amazon!!! It's very scary that in the UK there are no laws that would protect the common citizens and such companies can steal from simple people's... it's very disappointing....",0
"Received an email that my package was handed to the resident, that would be me, hmm funny thing is I was never handed anything let alone my package. Went to mailbox and my package was sitting along side the road next to me mailbox. How lazy this Amazon driver was!! Amazon be careful who you hire!",0
"Amazon used to be a great site, but between the consistent fulfillment issues (sellers often listing products as being multi-packs with associated pricing and then sending a single item) and the slow, intentionally difficult to navigate customer service options I'm one more incident away from just cancelling Prime finally after being a subscriber for well over a decade.",0
"What did I dislike? Giving money to Bezos.What did I like? Good pricing, goodss, shipping, etc.",1
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the shipment dates. You know, the ones on the item detail page. For Example Prime member's, shipment is stated two days, sometimes three days. these shipment dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the item shipment date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my shipment date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the item details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the item is actually delivered. When I purchase items from Amazon, I often choose the item according to the shipment date and that price and shipment date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the shipment dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the items on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
The item was way smaller than described/expected.,1
delievered my books a day early and have me nearly half price off with the prime day deals,2
Lost my money because I got a faulty product and Amazon customer service won't help me at all. I can't recommend them.,0
Sometimes not the cheapest but Amazon never fails to have excellent products at excellent prices.  I love the fact that when you buy directly from them and the product is not to your satisfaction you can send it back for free.  I made the mistake of buying Dr. Marten boots from ebay instead of Amazon and because they were too big had to pay a whopping £7.50 to return them.  I was gutted and vowed never to buy shoes from ebay again!  Amazon all the way!,2
"I have been an Amazon Prime member for at least 15 years and until the past 6 months to a year, I would have given Prime a 5-star review.  However, the 2-day shipping that used to be reliable is no longer reliable.  I would prefer they lower the cost of Prime and just NOT PROMISE 2-day order any longer. I understand we are in difficult economic times but if a company can no longer deliver what it promises, then perhaps it should just drop the support altogether.  In the past, I have paid yearly in advance for Prime (since it was $99/year), but have now switched to monthly Prime subscription because I want to be able to easily bail out if the support gets any worse.  I truly hate to see this happening because Amazon Prime has been a lifeline for me for years...my go-to when I needed something shipped to me fast and reliably.",1
can count on Amazon for the products at the best prices.,2
"Android App.  ADD ""Sort Price: Low to High""You do a great job of offering your customers' many useful options, a thinly veiled effort to increase your bottom line.

"While somethings are fine on Amazon, ive had my parcels delivered else where a few times and luckily for me i know my neighbours so they brought them to me also twice ive paid for monkey moneyboxes, and never ever got them, i get the feeling that their shipment drivers if youre not in they just post it in the next street, because its happened to much, i dont want to have to email or call over a £10 moneybox, also you cannot trust their reviews because if you write anything average they just dont post it, so how could you trust them?",1
So i have now been a prime member for over a year now and have to i love it so far life is so much easier with next day delivery. would recommend if your shopping on amazon to subscribe and enjoy the benefits not only with the fast delivery but also with the TV and music packages,2
"Order item for Christmas present was in on the day item was going to delivered and next thing during the day I got notification item deliveredOpened the door nothing. Contacted customer service and was told sometimes they scan items as delivered but still on van for the day,, (think I am stupid) and was told I had to wait 3 days and get back if not arrived. So received a email saying after investigating the matter they deemed item was delivered and I must go to the police Yes amazon is robbing people's parcels and saying they have been deliveredThey need to spot check there drivers to see what they doAnd now waste police time every time you don't receive your items to get a crime reference number thanks amazon for messing up my ChristmasMaybe put body cams on them",0
Amazon can be decent but when its average its average. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1
"Amazon is a great company with alot small problems, specially when it comes to vaguely answered customer support questions and those people have very limited power to help you with.And my most hated thing is the order status there should be more information and it should be more accurate.Other than that am happy with Amazon.",1
Delivery left in a recycle box the driver put through the delivery device handed to the customer if this had been stolen we wouldn't have any chance of a refund,0
I don't know how I would of coped without Amozon over this last year...with everything that has happened...it's times like this we have to appreciate them and all there delivery drivers for all they do...Thanks guys so much,2

"Very bad experience,  I don't advice any person to buy from them, they make me very disappointed with my order, getting too much late, when I called them to verify, they shown careless like they don't care and asked me to check with courier. Very bad service ,I'm very disappointed and not happy. They give me too much tension and I was shaking about my order. Now my order shown shipped but running late. I dont know when i will receive my order.... ..this is my last order ever. ",0
Amazon allows an order to be cancelled before the order has been dispatched.  I ordered a phone case and then noticed it was coming from China and would be a long time arriving. I checked to see it hadn't been dispatched and sent a cancel request. When this was not acknowledged I sent three more. .A day or so later I checked my Amazon account to find it was just dispatched in spite of all my cancellation requests. Amazon now tell me I had only 30 mins to cancel the order even though it hadn't been dispatched for almost two days after my cancellation.,1
ZUMZEE was advertising 3x Febreze plug in Air Fresheners for £13.99. I purchased 2 packs total £27.98. Very quick delivery. They looked like previous Febreze plug in packs. However they are very poor quality and hardly any perfume from them. Possibly they are like scented water. I will not buy any more.,0
"Amazon support is the worst. I got a defective item and it stopped working just days after the return window. The seller said they would send a replacement and to have amazon support help me with getting the shipping handled since their products are in amazons warehouse. The agents refused to listen or help and just copy and paste the same responses. They refuse to help and then lie to customers. One amazon agent told me that sellers have sent replacements to customers in the past, so that meant for a FACT that this seller also has a personal warehouse. Literally said it was a fact, but then when I asked if that seller for a fact has a warehouse because the agent knew of some sellers having their own warehouses? the agent refused to respond and just kept changing the subject. I asked the agent how they could know for a fact that the agent had a warehouse? Refused to answer. So I asked if they lied about knowing for a fact that the Seller had a warehouse, and the agent said that they could not confirm or deny that.... Wow amazon. Went from stellar support to almost one star reviews on trust pilot... Not to mention stores like costco (their membership costs less than amazons even) offers 90 day returns. Walmart, with NO membership offers 90 day returns as well and I have never had issues with their support either. You spend days trying to get help and get no resolutions. With all the money amazon generates, put some money BACK into customer service, and stop outsourcing the work to people who could not give less of a damn about the customers or their experience.",0
"I have been having the worst interaction on Amazon. First, I paid for a 75 dollar controller that was supposed to be brand new. The controller turned out to be used and the code that came in the box was already redeemed. Now I just subscribed to prime thinking they will charge me at the end of the month. That was a farce because they just took 15 dollars out of my account within 5 minutes. Customer support told me it will be 3-5 business days until I get a refund.",1
"Decent website. For the most part I can find what I want with relative ease. Not all items there are the best prices, so you have to really shop around. It's not easy to get live support from them anymore. They have put blocks into place to make it harder to find a way to contact them.",1
"It used to be easy shopping in amazon. Nowdays there are a lot of delays and when I cancel they still send the items after a few days that I have cancelled. When I return sometimes it takes two weeks and yet I don't get my refund and I should continue calling the. The funny part is I returned a few items at once and I didn't get refunded for some of them on time, while the rest was refunded as I returned them. I called them they say they didn't received it yet. I told them I returned two items at the same time to the same USPs Store and one got refunded in an hour, while the other one didn't get refunded, which is already over two weeks. The customer service is rude and barely able to understand english. They are not trained and they have no knowledge of the process. Terrible customer service representatives.",0
"They have reliable drivers masked by rude, and drivers that totally dis respect me as a customer. Throwing parcels over or by back gate saying handed to me in person. Yesterday had message saying parcel delivered to my safe place. Not there. Told to knock at doors to find it.",1
I sold on Amazon for over 10 years and their fees kept going up and up to nearly 50%. Terrible return policies that still costs the seller money when it should be on the buyer. They allow anything and everything fake be sold that could ultimately be unsafe products. Amazon takes zero moral accountability and milks it's seller fees as much as possible.,0

Their prices aren't really too competitive anymore. The shipping has gotten pretty ordinary shipping through USPS. Common sense says not to ship through such a dysfunctional government run shipment support. I've had packages delayed and even packages not show up when shipped through USPS when ordering from Amazon. When they use their own shipment people and UPS or Fedex there's no problem. But since things get shipped through USPS there's no way to get compensation or any kind of resolution to USPS's incompetency.,1
Good for customers but a nightmare for sellers! Their customer-centric policies make it difficult for sellers to make a profit as the company would accept a return from customers even if the customer has damaged the goods beyond repairs!,1
"Have had the same address and delivery instructions for over 20 years! In the last year I have contacted Amazon no less than 100 times about the same issue… Drivers either leaving packages on the pavement in plain view or not bothering to turn up at all and saying they attempted delivery. Instructions are always to leave in designated “safe place” so there is never a reason for a failed delivery. Sick of hearing pat customer service responses from people that are not equipped to actually deal with the issue or capable of deviating from pre-scripted procedures. Told every time they “understand” and “this is not the level of service we expect Amazon customers to receive” and “I will definitely ensure this never happens again.”…. A year! Over 100 phone calls, innumerable online chats and still…. The issue of ridiculously bad delivery, missing packages, dishonest drivers and poor customer services continues.",0

"Subject: Complaint regarding refund issues and poor customer serviceDear Amazon Customer Service,I am writing to you with great dissatisfaction and frustration regarding my recent experience with Amazon. As a loyal customer, I expect a certain level of service, which unfortunately has been severely lacking in my recent interactions with your company. I made a purchase on Amazon, using my own funds, for an item. To my disappointment, the wrong size was sent to me not once, but three times. In order to expedite the process, I used the return refunds provided to me in gift card form and immediately repurchased the item. However, due to the repeated errors made by Amazon, I finally requested a refund for the item to be returned to my original account.To my dismay, it took four weeks and multiple attempts to contact customer service to receive a response. Eventually, the refund was processed, but contrary to what I was informed, it was credited back to the gift card instead of my original account. I subsequently reached out to seniormanagers and was assured on four separate occasions that the refund would be transferred to my account within seven days.However, it has now been an unreasonable amount of time, and I still have not received the refund in my original account. Furthermore, when I contacted Amazon again to rectify the situation, I was informed that they could not refund the money from the gift card, which was originally my own money.I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by this level of service. It is unacceptable for Amazon to provide false information and promises regarding refunds, causing undue inconvenience and financial loss on my part.I kindly request a thorough investigation into this matter and a prompt resolution. I expect the refund to be immediately credited back to my original account without any further delays. Additionally, I would appreciate appropriate compensation for the time, effort, and frustration I have experienced as a result of Amazon's errors and poor customer service.I value my long-standing relationship with Amazon and hope that this complaint prompts a change in the way you handle such situations. I trust that you will take immediate action to rectify these issues and restore my faith in the company.I look forward to your prompt response resolving this matter.Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.Yours sincerely,Nigel Lane",0
FAST PRIME SHIPPING. ,2
I order a dvd boxset for 65$ before tax. The same day i recevided the boxset amazon dropped the price to 35$. I contacted customer service and ask if they could refunded me the diffrence. They said no and said i should return the product and then order it again. So there solution is to make me waste my time to go mail it back pay 8$ for shipping. Wait for a refund. Order it again and then wait for it to come back. Instead of just crediting me the diffrence. This is the stupidest possible way to correct this situation. I have work as a manger in retail for over 20 years at walmart and it just boogles my mind this was the response. So i will return the item; cancel my prime member ship and buy it elsewhere.,0
"Good pricing, decent goodss, but when they mess up, they mess up average with little to no compensation.I’ve bought from Amazon many times.  When their customer assistance agents say someone will get back to you, know that they will never get back to you.  Have heard that at least a dozen separate times and never once has anyone got back to me.They can usually correct things pretty quick, but the problems thst get them there are usually pretty average and they do nothing or very little to mitigate the issue.Overall I still buy from them because of the pricing but I am starting to slow down on purchases because their poor resolution on multiple problems has had me spend way too much time on the phone with them correcting their mistakes while I am actually paying to correct them for them, by being a customer.I have also caught them in their own policy lies and have it recorded where the agent refuses to put in writing what he says on the phone, even though he will put other things in writing.  I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.  Unbelievable.I think this company is dealing with the massive influx of sales during the pandemic and though I have little sympathy for the trillions in profit... overall they do pretty decent job... when they mess up it can be pretty average... but usually they don’t mess up and usually things will sort out.  I wish I could more easily support Canadian retailers though.",1
"I just made a purchase with Amazon amounting to £44.99. However Amazon took an extra £1 out of my account  (Separate Entry) with no explanation.To phone (The only way of contacting their customer supports, from what I can see) to find out what this charge was for would cost me over £1 per minute.What a rip-off.",1
ok not best  Anymore now  gone down hill,1
"Goods always delivered quickly and as described. Comminication is excellent. On the one problem I had with a faulty camera when it was still in warranty, they replaced it immediately.",2
Terrible customer service! Ordered some supplements and selected overnight delivery 4am to 8am. Well 8am comes and no package so I use their chat to find out where it is. The agent (sohail) was very rude and told me he would use “simple words” to explain that it may take 2-3 days even though item showed available and would be delivered overnight. As you can imagine my response was slightly colorful at which point he disconnected the chat. Well I had to call and they refunded my money but I’m still SOL on my supplements! Great way to treat your prime customers Amazon!,0

"I love Amazon, for the supports they provide at the prices they provide them.  Subscribe and Save is one of the coolest things we have seen in twenty years.  We have been Amazon Prime members for almost two years. BUT, BUT, BUT - I do not like Bezos' politics and I hate making him richer. I hate the fact that Amazon is still streaming NRA TV. But that aside the organization has internal problems. The shipping dept is LOUSY and must be poorly run. One in four packages we receive are poorly packed, have no bubbly wrap to protect the items or poorly boxed and shipped. This probably has to do with the volume they are processing BUT they need more personnel if it is not being done right. Where are the supervisors? My guess is that no one is paid what they should be paid to work or supervise at the company. Another reason to hate Bezos and his only interest being seemingly in profit and the bottom line and not in the customers' interactions. Typical corporate America. No matter how many fine things Amazon does they do not deserve a higher rating.",1
"I used to love amazon. I've been a solid customer for over 8 years. Probably spend over $5,000 a year with them. More and more with each passing year. Now their assistance has gotten worse, prices increased, and more and more shipping problems. Amazon get your act together.",1
"I use Amazon all the time, but will always pick another retailer when reasonable. Their fulfillment system is too easily exploited by counterfeiters. Anyone can use their fulfillment system, and all items are combined together. When a retailer sells through Amazon (including Amazon itself), they pull an item from their shelf. Could be a counterfeit someone sent in or a legit item. You don't know.With more traditional retailers online, you know they buy their stock from reliable distributors so you know for sure you are getting the item/brand you paid for.",1

This company does not consider the customer. They sent me an item on a phone that I did not buy. I returned it and instead of issuing the refund to my credit card they credited it to a Gift Card without my consent to force me to spend the 270.00 dollars on their page .Get out of this company. Walmart already has one-day shipping service.When I spend the gift card money I close the account and the credit card. No more Amazon.,0

"I placed an order on 06,01. I got an email on 13/01 telling me about the delay for my order. which stated : *If the order won't arrive by the time you need it, you can cancel the order or an individual item from your order by visiting Your Account, and viewing the order details. As long as the item hasn't entered the dispatch process,you'll be able to cancel it.*However, this was not true and it actually was impossible to cancel the order, either on my account or by contacting the supplier ( as per automated message on my account) who said that only Amazon could cancel it and also said that my payment was still pending , which is also untrue.I am now told by their advisors that it is not possible for them to cancel the order until it has been dispatched!!!!! I think I am just being fobbed off with random  excuses/explanations. This is ridiculous, makes no sense whatsoever and istotally unacceptable.This email also says: *We're sorry about the delay in getting your order to you, but I'm pleased to tell you that we're preparing it for dispatch now.**Within the next business day you should receive an e-mail from us confirming that the following items have been dispatched:*This ,too, is untrue as apparently they are still trying to locate the item and it has not been dispatched yet. But I do not want it  sent to me, I want it cancelled, as I have been saying since 13/01, and  my money refunded but according to their advisors this cannot be done until it has been dispatched.And apparently there is no way of getting this complaint escalated to a non existent complaint department as I a told the customer service is  also the complaint department . Resolver is not an option either as Amazon UK has decided not to accept complaints raised via Resolver.Absolutely disgusting customer serviceNEVER AGAIN",0
"For years Amazon has been one of my go-to websites for purchases, but just lately there has been a spate of deliveries where the box has just been too flimsy for the weight of the contents combined with the rough handling inevitably received from couriers, so they arrive crushed and/or torn with contents damaged or missing.  It's not the couriers' fault, it's poor packaging.  Amazon, please look again at your packing guidelines, heavy things need strong boxes that are well sealed.  If this keeps happening I'll be looking elsewhere.",0

What Amazon is doing is to make money on your return by holding your money for 30 days or more.SHAM ON AMAZON,0
"I believe that Amazon is in the process of going out of business. Several items recently were either damaged, wrong item (wrong box…) or expired. I suspect this has something to do with dissatisfied employees- because they should recognize what they are shipping out. When you push employees to work like robots, this was bound to happen eventually. Fortunately, Now most manufactures will mail directly (which was not the case several years ago), so it’s not really a problem as a customer to make the change. We just have to recognize the time has come. I do believe it is mostly to do with the greed of Jeff Bezos.",0
A lesson in good service,2
"Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime. It just seems more like a waste of money to me.But I've never had an issue with Amazon itself.",1
"Amazon themselves are not average, but the order drivers they hire all seem to be incompetent, I am constantly having packages delivered to wrong addresses, left in unsecure places despite giving explicit instructions on where to leave them, resulting in stolen packages, prime deliveries not arriving next or same day as promised, trying to deliver to a business address that has clearly marked opening hours late evening when it's closed and failing to attempt re-order at all iver the following days, I've lost count if how many packages I've had to ckaim a refund on because they simply never arrive, a company is only as strong as its weakest link, and deliveries are a very weak link",1
Bought replacement batteries for my cell and it was fulfilled by Amazon.  Received the battery in less time then their expected delivery time.  Great communication and fast delivery. Pretty awesome in my book.,2

However, when the product failed the manufacturer failed to honour the warranty because the product wasn't in fact sold by Amazon but by a third party supplier through Amazon. I had assumed buying from Amazon would have given me some protection but it doesn't so be very careful, suppliers might not honour warranties if you buy through Amazon.",0
I don't know what's going on lately with the delivery service with these companies but I am tired of them telling me my package is delivered and it's not delivered I just found out my package was delivered to the wrong house now I need to know if I'm going to ever receive it this is getting ridiculous I give a rating 0 they have my phone number no excuse they could have called to check to see if that was the proper house with the address,0
"Without Amazon, Christmas would have been a whole lot harder this year. All items arrived on time, with an additional month of Prime membership offered for an item that came a day later than promised.  Superb organisation!",2
"Very fast delivery, great products. I live in Slovenia, near to Italian border, so I get my orders really fast (on italian address). I suggest to pay for Prime, it's worth it!",2
This site has gave me great joy and can always find the things I need when I need it 👍🏾Love it❤️,2
"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative interaction with Amazon customer assistance over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a order date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer assistance to get a more specific order date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in order. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended interaction with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1
"I needed to send back my purchase for a smaller size.  I discovered the shipping would cost more than the purchase and received no help from them. I had to give the purchase away and then closed my account with this giant rip off company,",0
"I would give the no star!!!!I ordered so much from Amazon over 1000 of dollars, I'm a customer more then 12 years. I moved to a new construction subdivision and the carriers have issues and my account clearly shows that they have issues to find it. Even google map does not show my address. Some of my last orders didnt arrive for some reason but most of the things I ordered did arrive and I either kept or returned my items. My account shows that and I have prove and receipts for that. I'm a prime member paid 119 $ a year. After contacting them for items that didnt arrive, they send me a threat email that they will close my account due to me going against their""condition of use"" what does that even mean. The threat email : Thank you for writing to us.We're concerned about the activity on your account. We want to do all that we can to help you avoid any problems with the delivery of items you purchase from Amazon.com. Your account remains open and available for your use. Please keep in mind that we may close your account if you do not meet the terms of our agreements. To learn more about our policies, visit our “Conditions of Use” page. You can find a link to this page at the bottom of any page on Amazon.com.If you have any order or account related concerns, please contact our CustomerSincerely,Account SpecialistAmazon.com On top of that. It does not matter if you pay 119$ for a year and want to cancel your prime. You lose 119$ and no refund and they take your benefits regarding that you paid 119$ for a year. ????????. You should be able to keep the benefits until it expires and not take the benefits and the money but no refund. SCAM. I use to like amazon but it is not doing good. I start buying from Ali express where most of their stuff is from anyways and walmart where you get free  day shipping as well. They think they hurt me by the threat but they losing customers and money!",0
No respect for the parcel and being delivered by just throwing it over a gate as if there rubbish.This is not the first time and trying to make contact with amazon is a joke unless you want one of there Faq's answered. The company just doesnt care like there drivers.,0
I use to love ordering from amazon but man hoe much their customer service changed. They suck so much now. I asked one question and never got an answer just this chick going around the bush just to tell me she doesnt know that the hell she’s talking about. Idk how i feel about it now and to think ive been a prime member for so long.,0
"The fine things about Amazon is that it is the most known and most trusted(in my opinion) website out there. It always tells you exactly where your package is.(I'm a new customer, and my orders haven't came yet) There are SOME reasonable prices like for a chain I ordered was 3 dollars. Now for the average things. I've made 3 accounts to get my orders, and on all of them it says ""tHeRe WaS sUs ThInGs GoInG oN iN yOuR aCcOuNt""(it didn't look like that I'm just showing how dumb it is). I put in the correct things for the submission, but it always says ""ThAt'S nOt EnOuGh EvIdEnCe ThAt YoU oWn ThIs AcCoUnT"". Not to mention I have to wait 2 days for the same response. I've spend the last 9 days trying to get into my accounts. This is causing me a lot of stress.",1
ordered a stapler and it was supposed to come with a set of staples - the stapler arrived without the staples so not much use really,1
I have ordered many things at Amazon and I love their service and wide variety of items,2
"I recently purchased a washing machine from Amazon, I paid for a brand new unit and what I got was somebody else’s return. When I received the unit it was badly damaged and it had water in it so that’s how I knew that it belonged to somebody else first and they returned it. This is the second time that I purchased some thing from Amazon and received somebody else’s damaged merchandise. Obviously they are taking in damaged and returned items repackaging them and then selling them as a new!",0
"I ordered an external battery, airtags, and waterproof airtag covers. Some of the items were missing, and others arrived damaged beyond repair because the Amazon box had no packing around the individual items, and the weight of each item crushed other items and caused the tape to break on the Amazon box, allowing some of the items to fall out. I have contacted Amazon three times and spent over 3 hours on the phone, only to be hung up on. I have contacted them by chat 15 times with no help. One person finally said I would receive a refund but had lied. They told me to return the items through UPS, but UPS will not take the package because the items contain lithium and are dangerous to ship through the mail. I was then told to get a police report, but the police wouldn't write a report when the package was not stolen, and it was Amazon's fault for not packing the box properly. The items cost me $179.25, and I cannot get a refund, and Amazon refuses to help. They just reply with automated responses to return the items or get a police report. Still, I cannot do either because of the circumstances they caused by not packing the items properly for shipping. Buyer beware! Do not order expensive tech through Amazon because you cannot trust that they will be adequately packaged, and if they arrive damaged, Amazon will not issue a refund. I'm left with dangerous, useless items that I cannot dispose of.",0
I shop for everything online at amazon.com! I can get just about anything and sometimes with free shipping. I highly recommend this amazon.com.,2
Great company. It is really easy to purchase products on Amazon and never had an issue with returns. Prices are decent (though not necessarily the cheapest). I can think of two cons: I think if I would shop around I would find cheaper prices on some items  on Walmart or Target and I also hate the recent price hikes on Prime. Other than that I am happy the general service.,2
"Wasn't the greatest assistance I've had , The communication was poor and there was no updates on my order as it was for my nephews birthday!Luckily it did come a day before so I wasn't left empty handed.",1
i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early,2
"This is more of a review on Amazon service!I took in a parcel from Amazon, for the property next door. It is a rental property and it turns out that the family moved out before Christmas so are not aware that I have this parcel.I took a photo of the label on the front and contacted Amazon to see if they could either trace the recipient so they can tell them to come and collect it, or at least arrange for one of their drivers to collect it and take it back to the depot.However on contacting Amazon I was told there was no way they can do this, and I can either keep the parcel or dispose of it!!Either of these options make me very uncomfortable, as it feels totally wrong!It does make me wonder how many goods are just kept or disposed of by people who are being neighbourly and basically doing Amazon’s job for them! I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here. What on earth would I do if they did that and I told them “ oh sorry, Amazon said I could just keep it “ I would be mortified.So my advice is, don’t take in anyone else’s parcels unless you know the neighbour well enough to know they haven’t moved house!",2

Needs to be more seller friendly. But generally bullish on Amazon. They shut down 1 of my stores and only after sending legal demand did it fix. Ok!,1
Yet again another purchase through amazon for delivery 3rd or 4th... by yodelAnd surprise surprise delivery running late now 5th to the 9th .Cancelled my amazon prime account because what's the point if its coming viaYODEL it's aways late or doesn't ever arrive .. very poor again Amazon Very poor .. another customer your going to loose.,0
"Seems like they don't have much quality check of who they cooperate with. Sometimes my package didn't arrive and no one answered my emails, sometimes the package was so poorly packed that it was ruined and sometimes the quality was so bad I could not wear it.",0
They always go the extra mile,2
Amazon ha perso la Nike e questo era l'unico motivo per il quale lo usavo.  Ora dove le compro le Nike?,1
Amazon has been around since my college days. That’s when only students could use prime. I have a love hate relationship with them. Yes I know they f’ up but they also fix the issue too. I have no complaints specifically that I can even think of.,1

"I ordered quite an expensive Espresso machine from amazon. It never arrived but got marched as delivered the moment i got through customs.Customer services require me to file a police report. I do that. mail it to them. They ""DONT RECIEVE THE MAIL"".So i mail again. Get confirmation from amazon that the mail has been recieved. They STILL ""HAVE NOT RECIEVED MY MAIL"". I HAD TO CHANGE MY EMAIL ADRESS SEND IT AGAIN.Guess what:""POLICE REPORT DOES NOT HAVE A SEAL WHICH AUTHETICATES it"". By now i have spent a MONTH sending 14 mail calling the customer service 10 times trying to SUBMITT my police report.Police in my country used 2 weeks to process my police report. They won't file it in time. Bear in mind.Amazon they had no trouble recieving the mail at the start of the interaction. Only when i had met all the necessary requirements for refunding did trouble start.So in conclution:Amazon blocks your email so you cant get refunded. They wont accept Offical documents unless it has some form of stamp.NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON.",0
"Never again will i use amazon, got scammed and they dont want to help, trying to tLk to someone is shocking",0
I order a dvd boxset for 65$ before tax. The same day i recevided the boxset amazon dropped the price to 35$. I contacted customer service and ask if they could refunded me the diffrence. They said no and said i should return the product and then order it again. So there solution is to make me waste my time to go mail it back pay 8$ for shipping. Wait for a refund. Order it again and then wait for it to come back. Instead of just crediting me the diffrence. This is the stupidest possible way to correct this situation. I have work as a manger in retail for over 20 years at walmart and it just boogles my mind this was the response. So i will return the item; cancel my prime member ship and buy it elsewhere.,0
Nice and easy to order online will be using again online very easy support,1
So last year I was looking for Christmas shirts saw a sparkly reindeer image shirt so I ordered it. Only it was a iron on decal. No problem I can apply it to a shirt.So I posted my review for it and Amazon messaged me saying they couldn't post my review... I posted that it was a Decal not a shirt. So I guess you can't let people know what the item really is... Or isn't,1
amazon is a rip off company. i returned a cell phone which i bought from amazon. it has been more than 2 weeks they are not issuing me refund. i will take my case to social media and see how to get a refund. the cell was for 1200$. please no one ever should buy anything expensive from amazon,0
Amazon has consistently earned my praise for fast shipping and quality products.  I will continue to purchase items from them.,2
"I will leave Amazon.  They have a curated profile of who they want as customers and the tiers are quite obvious.  Their shipping system is dismal and random.   For so many people, Amazon simply cannot be bothered. The region they live in is not desirable to Amazon's accountants.  Profit is the ONLY motivation of Amazon. They shift all responsibility to the shipper, whose name they pull out of a hat.  Countless people that do not live in or near urban regions cannot reliably use Amazon.  I get endless refunds because my items never arrive.  Looking to join the obviously required class-action.",0

Always had a great interaction except for the one last time. i will come back edit this review if I have a acceptable interaction next time.,1
"Good when all is smooth flowing but very annoying when it offers next day order and then is delivered in 2-3 days... Never used to happen. Would like to think paying for a assistance provides quality standards back to the customer, especially after Prime prices were raised and goods prices are higher than in stores already. Amazon is now charging for returns also.  Stuff like this adds up over time and slowly pushes the customer away, in my personal usage.",1

There were not instructions included for the table I purchased.  So we can't put it together.  And I cannot figure out how to contact anyone at Amazon to get a set of instructions.  Plus I can't contact anyone at QEEIG website to get duplicate instructions,0
Getting Amazon Prime was a horrible decision! I have had so many shipping problems I can't even count them. I recently ordered some tattoo supplies. I am flying to NY tomorrow. I ordered the stuff on Tues and picked free 2 day shipping. As of Thursday my stuff has still not shipped. I now have to order from another company and pay a huge overnight fee. Definitely not woth the $100+ a year. It seems the bigger they get the less they care. Everything that made them a great company is slipping away,0

"I am writing this review not in reference to any of the supplied goods from Amazon, which I have mostly always been happy with. Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.I appreciate the fact that when things went wrong that weren't even your fault, that you fixed them for me. Thanks.",2

"I dont have any issues ordering with amazon and they usually have straight forward ordering and returns process. However, whenever I try to contact customer service this isn't an easy process. I recently tried to set up a business account, it locked me out when I was in the process of creating one and then I tried to contact customer services 3 times in a week and every time they said that I would be contacted within 24 hours which I wasn't. All I need is for someone to unlock the account and I'm not sure why their customer service is so terrible they can't do that. Anyone hoping to get through to customer services, brace yourself because it seems like everyone tries to pass the issue to another department and the issue is never resolved. To this day, my issue isn't resolved.",0
Placed an order in December for a food item. Yesterday (23/2/22) the item was recalled. The food had obviously already been consumed and to which I had food poisoning that week and when recalled there was a risk of “microbiology contamination”. When speaking to Amazon about this and explaining how I was not happy especially since I had to go see a doctor and have time off work. The response I got was “I’m sorry your order hasn’t arrived yet”. No help at all to settle my issue.,0
I like amazon but when I wanted to voice my opinion about a seller they would not post my review,1

Would like to retract my 5 star rating for this awful and pathetic company you call a business sending me emails telling me it my fault my parcel’s haven’t come and looking at investigating ME when it’s you and your company not listening to the customer instructions like I tell everyone don’t just leave anything in my door step give it to a neighbour or wait for me answer the door and you go against my word and just leave it any were and it’s get stolen and half time not even were you leave it and don’t see it again!!!! I’ve spend thousands with your company and get treat no respect and accusations like you are saying even though I spend so much each month PATHETIC and you know put icing on the cake for me most products go missing for my autistic son who doesn’t under stand when they don’t turn up and I go to have behaviour when I gotta go and spend MORE money for your incompetence oh andadd they’ve restricted me buying items as twice I’ve had refund due not getting my parcel and it’s been put on gift card which OFM are not replying for someone who’s been AMAZON for many years this incalled for,0
"Awaiting deliveries today got my time slot of 12-2pm Amazon van came and parked outside. No one came to the door. Thought must be trying to find my parcels. Next thing drives off and my orders are updated with ""attempt made to deliver"" and will re-schedule for next day. Checked my Ring Doorbell cam and driver never got out of his van and drove off. Was an Amazon marked van too not one of their delivery agents. Amazon need to get there house in order they cant keep treating customers like this.",0
"Amazon scams people!!! I don’t order things from amazon often, but sometimes they do have some cool stuff. I ordered one thing. When I checked out there was option for a one time FREE prime delivery. I was then automatically charged for delivery as a separate transaction! It wasn’t a big charge so I decided to let it go, but now my package is two days late and I received an email that I will be charged monthly for a amazon prime account. You know the one I never wanted. I called the customer service and line and after talking to a stupid machine for 30 minutes I was transferred to a real person just to answer the same questions again! She said the package was delayed and won’t be here for 5 MORE DAYS!! No refund for the shipping. The free prime shipping trail is a scam. It is not free, and it is not any faster than the regular free shipping! My package was important and time sensitive and I would have paid for the faster shipping if I had known this would have been a huge issue! When I told the customer service rep that she immediately tried to refund me. I told her that I still wanted my item, but I wanted to cancel any further payments! VERY annoyed with the service of amazon in every aspect. I will not be order ever again unless this issue is resolved to satisfaction! It is not just OK for packages to be a week late and then receive no explanation!",0

"Amazon uses third party sellers which may or may not honor refund request. Recently, I cancelled an expensive lighting fixture order, but the company sent it (after Amazon sent me a message saying the order was cancelled). I have been trying for almost two months to get a return label for a $500 item. Additionally, today, I received a NextBase 422GW car dash cam instead of a 622GW from a third party seller. This was a birthday gift for 9/22. My son helped me drive his birthday gift to an Amazon locker for return. The seller sent an old version at the new version price. And, last week, Amazon Warehouse delivered a microwave upside down with broken foam that was hugely dented inside and out for a small markdown. It looks like trash and cost $300 with tax. Now, I have to repackage this heavy item and bring it to UPS and go without a microwave, or reorder through Amazon (rewarding incompetence). Amazon has acceptable infrastructure (fast shipment, return lockers at third parity locations). It undoubtedly has greased some palms. Amazon has cut out its competitors, who now sell as third party vendors. Amazon is now careless. Yesterday, packages were thrown across my driveway to run over.",1

I always have to sift through and find real pictures of the item that ends up looking like it's from Alibaba or some knock off company. Those are low standards to follow!",1
"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience.

Normally I’m happy with Amazon. They deliver fast and have a wide variety of choice. Prices are not always very competitive though. What really sucks is the customer assistances. Everything is standardized. No room for a personal touch. Today I received a toaster but It’s been used but the only thing I can do is send it back.  I would never buy something electronically. I guess you can’t trust their suppliers,1

The packaging arrives open. Some products and never delivered and no refund given. The delivery people lie about delivery and this dishonestly continues. Amazon on purpose does not approve such reviews or deletes them abd keeps only good reviews on their website. Dishonestly at its best.,0

For a long time Amazon was number one with me. I have been a prime member for years. Returns used to be practically guaranteed on anything I purchased.I shopped with confidence. Lately its like they've been taken over. Customer assistance has actually stooped to telling outright lies. I was accused falsely of returning an empty bottle once they wanted me to prove my innocence. That ended up meaning a loss for me. Recently an agent told me a refund was processed but it never was. I have also gotten used to late deliveries. Its sad to see Amazon go downhill.,1
"Great site, no problems",2
"What’s the point in updating your delivery instructions when the carrier does not follow it? I updated my delivery instructions last night because I knew I was not going to be home in time to take this package today. All parcels are left in my SAFEPLACE, the shed. So when it is handed to a resident!!! That is not my safeplace. Knocking on all my residents doors and have they received my parcel? Nope. Did Amazon let me know what house number they delivered it at? Nope. Lost package and now they want to tell me that they may have scanned it incorrectly? I have a voicemail…6minutes long of pure silence. Lost package & now a Very unhappy customer. Most carriers with Amazon have always left the packages in my shed without me giving delivery instructions and all of a sudden it is handed to a resident and no one knows where my package is?!?!?!USELESS",0
I have been an almost daily customer of Amazon.Com for about three years now! I have bought everything from underwear to camera equipment to Greek Orthodox Easter bread to hard to find theological books on Amazon.Com.  You can get super fast shipping by signing up for Amazon.Prime and you'll save a TON of money on shipping.  I have come to trust Amazon.Com to provide the lowest prices anywhere--even better than those of clubs like Books A Million Discount Cards.   The variety and choices are great.  Even their third party vendors provide wonderful service.  Amazon.Com is certainly where it is at! Returns are also a snap!,2
"I have always used Amazon.com for just about anything. They have a large selection of items. Shipping has always been fast and I can just click and go. There was only one time that I needed customer service and when I spoke to the rep, the person was very knowledgeable, helpful and professional.Will definitely use them again!",2
"Absolutely useless customer service agents.  If you have a question don't expect a solution,  just expect to be given 3 different numbers leading to people who don't know anything",0
Let’s be real: there are a lot of positives. You can find pretty much anything you need on amazon materialist wise and shipping is generally very fast. The cons are that some of the companies through amazon reselling items can be sketchy and it can be concerning whether that item (lets say a beauty item) is legit manufactured by that company. The other issue is a little more philosophical I suppose but amazon has kind of become a monopoly and is putting a lot of smaller companies out of business.,1
Have dealt with company on a number of occasions and i find it a very reliable company.,2
I ase Amazon for almost every thing> Thay have never let me down on anything. I am one very happy loyal customer,2

This is not the first time .. have installed a delivery box and still the items are left by the door , so even put written instructions on the delivery box and the door nope still the same ... so delivery drivers cant read??? Do they not have to pass a crime check??Have been told latest scam is delivery driver takes a picture then tells his mates where to go .. BUT legally you can claim a refund or replacement as LAW state this is not been delivered if left on door step , that's why the drivers say handed to resident which again is not proof of delivery ... im cancelling anything to do with amazon prime , alexas are going in the bin the company has got so corrupt with its ""AI"" bull crap all that is, is a way to watch and listen more to you, AMAZON your a disgrace with incompetence drivers who steal and con us and you ... BUT hey you need a heart to care !!!!!!!",0
"Purchased a lot of items and shipping was always in time. Product prices are sometimes more expensive than in a nearby store but gladly pay a few cents extra with the convenience of fast delivery. Overall I had a great experience but what could be improved is their customer service. They are very hard to contact, if not impossible most of the times.",2
My book is not showing on Amazon.Com but is on Amazon.UK.  I have repeatedly messaged Amazon about this but none of their advisors read my emails correctly. I have tried to raise a formal complaint by asking for details of their procedure / contact but these requests have also been ignored.  I have been disgusted by Amazon’s failure to address these issues.,0
"I believe Amazon is a great company and  offers fantastic goodss for fantastic prices. However, that being said Amazon Prime is terrible. It offers less options than Netflix (by far). The free kindle rental offers a wide selection of books you've never heard of before while restricting any popular book series to purchase only. To top it all off the free 2-day shipping has been horrendous. Out of my last 10 orders, 4 of them have not made it by the day they promised. I have called customer support every time and they have simply said, it will be there tomorrow. It's a GUARANTEE. Yet they act like it's no big deal that your shipment isn't going to make it by the time they promised. (Which in reality they typically give themselves a day for processing too so it turns out to be closer to 3 days anyway but it's still late). So unless you plan on buying a fair number of order less than $25 save the money.",1
Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
"Fast delivery, amazing service, wanted to return a hand trolley, processed by amazon within 3 days. Easy returns. Will buy again from them.",2
Okay so I have now had 8 funko pops damaged before they got to me .. and everytime I complain they try to give me credit onto my account but for items only shipped and sold by them .... but its there shipping that keeps damaging my funko pop ... so what am I suppose to do? Im sick of it,0
the decision to sign up to amazon prime was one of my best online shopping decisions. i simply am amazed by the speed of delivery. they really got me hooked.,2
"i have shopped with this site from usa, i worked doing their tasks, excellent, the only problem is you are limited to what you can buy, but very good and always received goods on time.",2
Great price and  range of pen refills.,2
Service of course decent,1
"Amazon has been GREAT, exceeding other retail avenues on price, order and customer support.  That seems to be changing.  It's getting nearly impossible to contact an actual person if you have a problem.  Over the years we get about 1 in 20 mis-deliveries. In the past you could contact them, talk to a person and either get a replacement or sometimes they could contact the carrier to find and fix a mis-order.   Not possible anymore as far as I can tell,  I've spent the last 30 minutes trying to break through the Barrier - getting nowhere.  I am advised by robo-support that even though they've said it's delivered... it may take up to 36 hours for it to actually be delivered.  If this support continues it will be the revival of brick and mortar shopping",1
Wish I could give less stars.Where to start apart from the fact this company are ablist(discriminate against disabled people)Won't help and when you ask to speak to a manager the advisor says the manager can do the same as me.When trying to return an item be sure you have bought a printer as you will have to print a label.Just don't buy the printer from Amazon as if it's faulty or the wrong item you won't be able to print the return label.Amazon are a joke and having call centres in foreign countries is not very helpful for someone who is deaf.If you want my opinion DONT USE AMAZON. THEY ARE TERRIBLE,0
"Purchase an item on the 24th aug 2023 , item was being sold by Amazon eu and advertised as in stock at time of sale . After sale I was informed delivery time to be confirmed. Nearly every day since purchase item has been advertised as in stock by Amazon eu . After contacting Amazon I was informed that the item was not in stock and also told that (in stock ) does not mean the item is in stock . Hear is what happened on 11/8/23 , the item said 13 in stock and while speaking the phone a Amazon advisor was able to tell me that there was now only 12 available while we were speaking, I asked the advisor could I not have one of the 12 and was told that is not how it works (lol) . So I pay for the item and Amazon won't deliver it but won't deliver it when it is clearly in stock and can't provide a delivery date . So if you see a item you like and is in stock, understand that the term (in stock ) written on a advertisement on Amazon platform does not actually mean (in stock) and what it does mean is very unclear.",0

I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
"I think that these are the main core main issues of Amazon that makes Amazon anti-customer friendly.1) Want to use Amazon Prime Now? Sadly, you don't get free order, you have to first spend $35 or more to get free 2 hour order. If not, they'll charge you $4.99 for order. Why can't it be free no matter the cost? Membership cost is ridiculous, but yet, it's not free or maybe $0.99.2) Prime Video app does not support 'Chromecast' so that we can cast shows and movies to TV's. We're expected to watch content on our phones but we can't control what we do, even though membership cost is ridiculous.",1
"The Amazon Company has not met it's responsibility to it's customers. Many of it's goodss, that used to be delivered in just two days are taking weeks. When you pay an annual fee, you expect promises to be kept!Amazon is also led by an ultra liberal person. It's offering and management of employees reflect that. It sheds a negative aspect of it's very existence!",1
"I purchased an android 5G capable phone, on startup it took over an hour to complete, storage was 30% used - 70% available. It never recognized my fingerprint to unlock apps, and ran slower than my 3G android. I inquired a better refund explaining that I am mobile impaired. They insisted that I needed to bring it to the post office and send it that there was no way to have it picked up. Discontent but still agreeing I ordered a new phone upon its arrival I began to switch insensitive apps to the new phone and everything appeared to be fine I searched the internet so that I could probably factory reset the other phone to clear my data. I then began to reenter passwords and log into accounts and verify the IP address to the new device when I noticed that I didn't have administration rights on the new device because it hadn't completely wiped the old device and fragments of the applications remained. Which meant I needed to reboot the First new phone that I got so the IP address would register in the applications and I could make the transfer from within. After 4 hours of watching the screen turn and turn and tell me downloading and updating I powered off and put the phone away and try it again in a few hours. Extremely frustrated I called Amazon customer service back again today and made it very clear that they need to do something because I have to bring that phone now to a technician to have him go into the hard drive and extract my data. This is going to cost more than the phone is worth and Amazon refuses to do anything. I will happily return the phone but somebody needs to come and get it. It's winter time in Quebec I am mobile impaired how in the world do they expect me to get to a post office",0
Excellent. The prime fee is well worth payingFree next day order on many things Free films although I've one one niggle. Not all are free on prime I looked for a film over 20 years old And although I pay for membership they want £5.49 extraI found it elsewhere on DVD for £1.99Ordered it. Now it's mine to keep foreverI never pay their silly prices for film support I already pay for,1
I bought Apple AirPods Max for my daughter’s 18th birthday and never received the item. I received a notification and email saying that a delivery was attempted and there was nobody there to receive the delivery and it would be re attempted later in the day. When we challenged that with video recordings that no attempt was made to deliver the item I was told that it had never left the Amazon warehouse. Now I am being told the item is lost in transit. Seriously??? So all the failed delivery and re attempted delivery was a joke??Can you believe the anguish my daughter went through on her 18th birthday celebrations?And all we got was a sorry????NEVER USE AMAZON EVER AGAIN!!,0
I ordered an important package that was supposed to come a week before it came.,1
"I am a Amazon prime  member and been a loyal customer for years,but after todays expeirence I have had enough,my delivery was due at five past twelve pm following the tracking on the Amazon app they kept putting the delivery time back all the time I and still waiting at seven o'clock at night,just sat in all day when I could have been doing other things,this is how they treat there customer's,",0
"I know Amazon has its critics but my experience is entirely positive.  They deliver as agreed, the products are as described.Returning items, as I rarely do, is very easy and free.  Their customers services have real people who actually listen and help.Not having good health I find Amazon a blessing.",2
One of the best internet companies. Always reliable but won't necessarily get the best bargain for your buck!,2
Shameful company. Drivers have to urinate in bottles due to strict rules prohibiting them from taking toilet breaks. ,0
delievered my books a day early and have me nearly half price off with the prime day deals,2
"Although, I don’t like how Amazon has taken over the market in the US, I have to admit that I can find almost anything that I need quite easily online, and their return policy is excellent. I stick with them because of the ease of these returns. They have made shopping so easy and I can find almost anything. I also love reading all the reviews, which helps me decide what to get. ￼",2
"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I initiated a return for refund. The next day UPS picked the item up and delivered it to Amazon the following day! I go into check the status on Amazons website and it just states that a return was requested. Now 2 weeks later their website has the same status! I’ve contacted customer service 4 times and get nowhere with them! I should be seeing and updated status, per their policy, and received an email, per their policy, by now, stating the refund process has begun, but I have received nothing but lip service and no refund! Now they are forcing me to file a complaint through Visa to get my refund! TERRIBLE way to treat a good customer!",0
"If you're looking to buy something that could be imagined, Amazon is the best place for it. Ships fast, and I've never had issues with amazon. Once my order took 1 week to ship and i was so disappointed than  owner offered me a better deal for the waiting and amazon has great product quality.",2
"We are glad to have a company like amazon that is very trust worthy and super dependable. i have been purchasing from all amazon sites since the beggining of amazon and it never let me down, even if products comes defected or wrong item is deliverd and even if i dont like the item they give immediate return and full refund",2
"Very slow when processing orders, I know you are a big company but make it faster so I can be a happier customers!!!!!",1
"I know this behemoth is not well liked, but when you live out in the middle of nowhere they are fantastic. I ordered a sack of flour yesterday afternoon, it has just been delivered. Whilst the price is slightly higher than if I buy direct, Amazon does not charge me ridiculous shipping charges and doesn’t then take two weeks to send it.",2
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a order, they take away the packaging from their last order and use it again.",1
"I can't deny that amazon has always made it right. If a product has been misrepresented, defective or has some other problem, my money is refunded and the shipping to return it is always free. Also, when something didn't arrive by the promised shipping date, they extended my Amazon prime membership a month. I'll take that. I've also ordered the wrong cables for a kindle and they helped me to get the right ones and didn't charge me extra. I am really satisfied with their customer service. One of the many reason, I'll stick with them.",2
"Awesome customer service, other companies should follow this example. It would be 5 stars but sometimes dealing with the offshore customer service teams can be frustrating.",2

"Worst customer service. Amazon now uses sub-shipping companies such as dynamex who tends to misdeliver the item. Contacted Amazon to look into the lost item and asked for the refund. This was their response to a 13-year-old loyal prime member. Nesha | Customer ServiceUnfortunately we can't replace/refund this item.

"How is this dysfunctional company still in business??? I laced an order which was out for delivery yesterday and by 7pm it was a no show, tracking just stated it was out for delivery, tried today and it states package out for delivery today.

This company used to be a world leader,  now it is just another washed up site that feels that it is perfectly o to treat customers like cattle.",0
"Since Amazon has gone to its own shipping, the shipping has become unreliable. I recently ordered three cases of copy paper at the same time, same order--one came one day, a second came the next, and the third never came and Amazon told me it had been returned. How can three packages, ordered at one time, each find a different path (or not) to the purchaser? With other order, packages have been dropped off at neighbor's houses and then shown on the Amazon website as being 'delivered'. Clearly Amazon should not be in the shipping business. And for the privilege of this Amazon ""assistance"" the company has increased its membership fees substantially. I am frankly looking at alternate suppliers.",1
"ok support, pretty acceptable prices for most of the things you can find.Sometimes shipment is super fast and sometimes it is delayed, you never know what's coming.But in most cases, the top wait is a week.",1
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1
"Usually my amazon deliveries are great, but only when I deliver to my mother's home as they always put my parcel behind the wheelie bin if no one is home or just in general preferred space even if I'm home and they take a photo to let me know. However, when ordering, make sure to check what area you live in cause some areas are prone to either stealing your parcels if its small. I ordered 2 mascaras recently and it was suppose to come Thursday and suddenly I get a notification it's delivered today and left in the letterbox when it was not there at all, so disappointed, I'm never going to order to my apartament as my parcels are always never delivered, only if they're large parcels then they arrive as I'm shown tracking, and it arrives to me as I wait downstairs, also depends who delivers it, but when it comes to small packages it's always a problem, I'm awaiting a refund and re delivered same item to new address. Plus I didn't get a tracking map this time for this one  the shipment just flew out of nowhere, it kept saying delivering tomorrow then today and just switching up.",1
"Groceries came slightly damaged, Amazon sent me a complete replacement immediately and told me to do what I wished with the damaged item! Great service,",2

"I want to say, everytime I purchase something that is ""fulfilled' by Amazon; I have an issue. It is always the driver delivering it to the wrong address or not following the delivery instructions I provide.When it happens, customer service is usually good about it. Not this time.I received notice that my item was next to be delivered. About 10 minutes later, I received notice that it was delivered. The picture showed a rug outside the door it was left by. I do not have a rig by my door. I tried to call customer service and was told no one is answering due to the pandemic. I then got online and started chatting with a customer service rep. This was all within 5 minutes of the delivery notice. I asked them to have the driver come back, get the package and deliver it to the right address. The rep said it was scanned and marked as delivered by accident. I said, I suppose the app telling me I am the next stop, the package being placed in front of a door, the order marked as delivered and a picture being taken is all an accident as well? The rep said it was. Again, I asked for the driver to come back and deliver the package to me. The rep asked me to wait until tomorrow for delivery, despite me telling her several times it was already delivered. She continued to argue until I finally asked for my money back. My chat was transferred 2 times to a different rep. The 3rd one finally said he issued a refund. We shall see.",0
"I payed for Amazon Prime which includes streaming music. However, since they have rolled out their new extra charge music assistance, I cannot find a way to access the music streaming benefit that I have already paid for.  Every time I click on anything to do with music, it takes me to a page to sign up for their Amazon Music Unlimited at an additional charge.  Even when I click on something that says Amazon Music that says it is included with my Prime membership, it takes me to a page to sign up for the new assistance at an additional charge.  I feel like I should contact a lawyer and start a class action suit because there are millions of people who have sign ed up for Prime with the understanding that they can stream music with their membership, but Amazon is effectively removing the benefit that we have already paid for and trying to force us to sign up for their new assistance at an addition charge. This is fraud.",1
"Some of my orders have never arrived, from different shops and different goodss. It’s the fourth time in 2 months. I get an email saying that the parcel was delivered, and the status of my order says delivered, however I never received it. I tried a different address and the same happened. Amazon provided me with refund, but it’s being a hassle to buy a goods I need and wait for it, when it doesn’t arrive I have to call them just to find out I will not get what I was expecting.",1
Amazon ha perso la Nike e questo era l'unico motivo per il quale lo usavo.  Ora dove le compro le Nike?,1
"I buy almost everything through Amazon, it's so convenient when you're a Prime Member. Gotta love them for that! The issue I had with them was when I purchased a 12k of pint size Mason Jars. They were shipped in an extra big box with hardly any padding. So when I got the shipment it was obviously shattered to pieces. I called Amazon because I wanted to return it, I didn't want to deal with the mess and I was told that it was a liability for them to get it back from me. But it was ok for ME to get broken glass? I don't think so! So after I talked to the customer assistance rep and tell him/her about proper ways to ship items they offered me a new shipment of the same item. I was not happy. <<<< Fast forward 2 days later >>>> I get the new shipment in the mail. And yes, it was BROKEN, AGAIN! Shattered to small pieces, made nothing! So again I'm on the phone with someone in customer assistance who can't really change anything in the warehouse wanted to send me a replacement! I just asked for my money back and called it a day. For an e-commerce company that deals with so many goodss, they did not a very fine job at properly packaging the glass items. Very disappointing!",1
Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1
I received my package with a delay of 2 days but it arrived safe covered by a fine packaging!,1

"Big travelers and therefore big online shoppers, we (inclusive of associates, friends, neighbors and family) discontinued not only our Prime memberships held since inception but any and all business with Amazon, who we had supported from the beginning. We abandoned our purchases and videos and then debanked our stock as we debunked the Amazon business model. We did this after receiving numerous damaged/defective products, many in boxes far bigger than the product, without protective packaging. We attempted resolution for several months before realizing the corrupt structure that Amazon lives under, the model Jeff Bezos embraces so lovingly as he fills his pockets and dances away. When we attempted to resolve one very expensive problem (received wrong product) after returning some and donating other damaged or defective products, Amazon's clear disdain of law, dishonor of ethics and clear indifference to their own documented policies was appalling. Since then we continue to learn of poor conditions for employees and bullying of vendors.",0
I have been a major user of Amazon Prime for more than 8 years and have NO COMPLAINTS with their service or handling of returns.,2
"Horrible outsourced customer service. Why would they care about your problems when the are in a different hemisphere, a different culture, and completely different ethics.  Sure let's move customer support to India the rape capital of the world. That will show how inclusive we are. Spent numerous calls and hours trying to resolve order issues and them randomly wiping my account.  Customer support is never helpful with a thick language barrier without any US Based support options. Paying for prime was meant to result in two days delivery but here I am waiting a week for items on the prime list. The only way to win at all in this capitalist culture is to boycott and refuse all transactions ",0

"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day order was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the item.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day order is bs.  I’ve had several two-day order packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the order would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day order mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the items sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1
"Amazon.com is a website so huge that its impossible to ignore their impact on society and retail as a whole, they have driven several competitors into bankruptcy including mom and pop stores who cant compete on price, small/medium sized competitors by lowering their prices on goodss (like baby goodss) which forces their small/medium sized competitor to lower prices to compete with Amazon and then after they go out of business Amazon will raise their prices when there is no competition around (this has been in news articles). Amazon has also been in the news for things like their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees by timing how many seconds they take to pick an order and pack it, limiting bathroom breaks, and making workers work during Covid-19 even though several of their employees got Covid-19 in their fulfillment centers.  So why do you ask do i keep buying from a company like this? for one simple reason, convenience. Amazon has a huge selection of goodss, they allow for easy and FREE returns within 30 days where other competitors charge restocking fees for returns and make returns at customer expense for shipping costs. Amazon also has a presence in many countries, ive purchased stuff from Amazon Japan, Amazon UK and had the items shipped to the United States very easily.So why did I rate Amazon.com 3/5? well because while they may be very convenient to buy from they also have very poor packaging and dont let customers specify what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in. Amazon has gotten some heat from environmental groups trying to get them to cut down on plastic and cut down on cardboard boxes in the past and we still see petitions online constantly being opened about their packaging. A simple solution would be to let the customer choose what kind of packaging they want their items shipped in during the checkout process and if theres an extra costs associated with more packaging materials then the customer can decide if they want to pay the extra costs or not. I would totally welcome the ability to choose what packaging material Amazon uses for my orders because I would love to be able to order things like art books, movies, collectibles, and video games from Amazon but whenever I try to order any of these items from Amazon they ship the items in a plastic padded envelope 99% of the time or a cardboard box without any packing paper or void fillers and when I finally receive the item it will be all scuffed up or dented during shipping, have a loose disc (movies and video games), or be damaged in some other way so I would have to go through the trouble of returning the item back to Amazon which isnt decent for the environment either since it would costs more fuel and packaging material to be sent back to Amazon. The combination of Amazon's business practices, their poor treatment of fulfillment center employees, and their poor quality packaging which prioritizes getting the package to the customer as fast as possible over the condition that the items arrive in at their destination are the reasons why I gave Amazon a 3/5 score.",1

"I am a faithful customer of Amazon recently I've had two small situations that I needed Amazon to intervene. I will say that when I reached out to Amazon they were very thoughtful, very timely, very professional, they listened to make sure that my issues were resolved. I'm very grateful which will make me continue to want to shop with Amazon in the near future😊",2
"I've been loyally using Amazon for around ten years now, but my experience with it in 2024, especially within the last two or three months, has been absolutely dreadful. The two most common complaints I have to give, and the most annoying -1. Orders being delayed or outright being lost. I had an order that was out for delivery, then it kept being delayed until I was told it would arrive by 10pm, then it was delayed by two days, and the same thing just happened but this time delayed by four days. How can an order be OUT FOR DELIVERY and then end up being delayed by days?2. The refund system. I was told by an automated service that I'd be refunded for said cases above, but the system then told me I'd be refunded once the items are returned. I contacted one of the agents and questioned how can I return something that didn't arrive, and thankfully they agreed and refunded me. I don't know what's changed internally, but Amazon used to have reliable delivery and a reliable refund system. In the past months it's just completely gone downhill. I won't be using them from here on out. Do yourself a favour and use one of the many alternatives that now exist, there are plenty of great websites out there that are currently much better. ",0
"Literally the worst shopping experience I've had online. Account was closed for suspicious activity. Customer service is a joke, you'll get 15 different answers no one knows what's going on. You need to talk to an unreachable account specialist to get your account reinstated. Do not shop here. I lost two weeks of my life I'll never get back. Nevermind the $50 balance on my account that I'll apparently forfeit. I genuinely hope you all die a slow and painful death",0

"I used Amazon to buy books many years ago, never have any problem.  But when I start buying electronics from them, I have to find out the hard way that if it malfunction after one month while under warranty, Amazon don't care.  Go deal with the manufacturer yourself.  Recently I also start to sell on Amazon because of eBay fee hike, but it is quite a disappointment.  If you think 10% fee on eBay is bad, Amazon charges 15% plus 99cent per item if you don't fork out 40 buck a month for pro account, plus another $1.35 each if it is 'Media products'.  That's 26.7% for a 20 buck DVD!  Plus all the illiterate, ignorant, or downright retarded customers I came across on Amazon which I've never seen on eBay for the past 12 years.  But since they're there, I priced all my Amazon listings 15 to 50% more than my eBay listing to justify the hassle.Listing items on Amazon is also a beetch.  If your product doesn't have UPC or EAN, you will have to buy one or steal one from a soup can.Another note for people who cares about seller feedbacks.  9 out of 10 customers on eBay leave feedback because they want 1 back.  1 out of 3 customers on eCrater leave feedback because customer doesn't get feedback rating.  Only 1 out of 5 customers on Amazon leave feedback because they can read and write and their parents are not siblings.",0
"I have been a customer of amazon.com for a long time. I am overall satisfied with its supports. However, when I share my reviews, only the positive ones get posted. Also, lately, as much as l would like to be understanding of the special circumstances of the pandemic and the confusion it has created, i find myself more inconvenienced than what it is reasonable, from my perspective. When ordering supplies; whether because of unavailability of it, or at times showing available items on the site, yet not been able to order them. For one reason or another not been able to place items in the ""cart."" I have tried to reach customer support to place the order, when in real need of an item. Customer Service has had a recording which states it is also unavailable? Is there something going on I am not getting? I wish I could stick to this site...but it's been kind of challenging to do so. Hope it can improve and that it is just a temporary situation. Thanks. Denise.",1
I joined Prime and ordered 2 seperate products one took 7 days to arrive and the other 5 days not the next day delivery promised by Amazon. Furthermore their response was odd a long email in an English I don't know and condescending. Little wonder the ASA are investigating this,0
"The website of this company was made by half-brained, one-armed coders and it was approved as competent   by their corporate bosses who sustain themselves on backside juice. (unfortunately trustpilot did not allow more appropriately descriptive language)",0
I would not recommend amazon to anyone. I have noticed multiple times they have charged me more than what my order says I will be charged and every time I bring it up they either tell me they didn't make any charges or check with my bank. This time she tried to tell me they didn't take any money so I asked if I could send screenshots because she said the transaction IDs were incorrect I emailed the screenshots to her. Then she came back with that money is just on hold not taken out to call my bank. When your sneaking money from people your scamming them period! Even if it's a dollar here or there.,0
This company always comes through with their promises. Ordered so many items throughout the years and they NEVER fail to deliver. 100% recommended!,2
Awesome free and fast delivery love it...,2
I shop amazon all the time and whenever there has been an issue they always take care of it.  I would recommend it,2

I purchased 1 FitproVII on10/12/22 from Amazon. I am a prime member and would expect the watch to last longer than 11 mos.It no longer will turn on nor charge.I also purchased same watch around 03/23 for a family member. My disgust is with the double talk return screen I had to navigate which went nowhere.We are reconsidering our membership unless contacted.,0
First rate company. They aren't all about screwing customers out of money like light in the box. Customer service has live human beings and doesn't jack u around like light in the box.,2
"I was attempting to reach my amazon delivery driver in hopes that they would return with my packages. The customer service reps are the most unprofessional and have developed a culture of disrespect and disregard for customer needs. I was bounced around to two reps then the automated rep. I opted for another rep and he didn't allow me to voice my complaint he just hung up. There should be a way for these individuals to be held accountable for their deplorable behavior. Maybe that's wishful thinking on my part, but amazon needs to do better.",0
"Amazon cancelled all my recent orders due to a ""security concern"" that they thought someone else had accessed my account - they did not, and these were orders I personally placed on Amazon, but their security system is too stupid to know the difference. Now I am struggling going back and forth between the BBB and the Amazon Executive Account Team.Get rid of your damn ""security"" system if it is stopping people from doing legitimate business on your website!Edit for Update: Amazon restored my order that was canceled. Rating increased because my order was restored to my account, but customer support was very unhelpful. 3 stars at most only because of the headache it caused me trying to get it fixed.",1
"Great place to buy items if dealing directly with amazon, but had a few problems with traders!",1

"Amazon has now put in affirm so they can pay monthly, sounds great till you read that it’s 10-30% interest on any product which means you are paying anywhere for 20 extra dollars to 100. Will not be using Amazon for any holiday shopping. They keep ripping off their customers",0
"All I ever seem to hear from other scarred ex-Customers of Amazon is that they will never use Amazon or Amazon Marketplace again.Having returned £152 (+£20 postage) two items to a Chinese Seller, quite simply, Amazon refuses to forward the refund for either sums of money.I have now spent since the items arrived in June, trying to resolve this issue; Amazon has an in-house Department called 'A to Z Guarantee' - quite cleverly, Amazon doesn't specify what the name implies; however, it appears to guarantee, no matter what, its Customers will NOT receive a refund NOR any explanation for their refusal.I have proof the goods were posted and have been assured on four separate occasions, the money had been refunded to my bank account; however, no money has been refunded.As it's nigh on impossible to find ANYWHERE one can scribe a negative review, making public Amazon's disgusting administration of their Customers; I can only guess Review sites are intimidated by the size and the power Amazon holds and are afraid to publicise the awful experience experienced by so many members of the public.",0
"I buy most things from here, great value",2
I will be a customer for life. Really love their commitment to offering the best value and customer service out there.,2
nice site to grab items from a list of trusted vendors.,2
Do Amazon deliver quicker than you can order off their website or is it cluttered with subscriptions and signing up for prime/fast shipment?,1
"I was’t happy with the having to return a whole product when it was just one thing missing. I clink a like to ‘make a complaint’ and that takes you to a page that says ‘page doesn’t exist’ Called and got through to someone, she couldn’t help and put me through to someone. They said they are in Audible and cannot help. They put me through to someone who says Amazon doesn’t have a complaints department?! As a protested that I can’t believe they don’t have a complaints department and I was giving him my email address - he says the line is cutting out and cant hear me?! Come on!",0
Like HomeJoy haha!  It's so much better when a big tech company that knows what is doing just easily replaces the services of all these startups getting funding for no reason.  Thank you Amazon for doing it right!,2
Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.,1
"As other customers have reported, drivers just leave the parcels on the doorstep and disappear. We have made 6 complaints about this recently, which have been ignored. The last straw was today when we found sheepskin slippers on the doorstep absolutely dripping wet. We have cancelled our prime account and got a refund. If only they would listen.",0
"Amazon is convenient, UNTIL you need customer service. I ordered a jacket online that dropped in price by $15 just two days later. I contacted customer service before the item was delivered, and they refused to refund the difference. Said to return the item and repurchase - what a joke! The $15 is not going to break me, but will be returning the item based on principle.",0
Terrible!! Was due a delivery with prime a week ago. The morning of delivery my account orders changed to undeliverable as damaged in transit and a refund will be given. One item from the package was returned the next day and I got a refund but 3 items are ‘missing’ and now I have to wait 14 days for a refund! Customer service is not acceptable and been told different things. First to wait to the 30th then the 11th august. Was told someone would contact me within 24hrs but they never did! It’s beyond a joke. Quick enough to take the money! Last person I spoke to said they can see its transit and will issue a refund after the 11th. Why? Why can’t they give me refund if they know it’s being sent back ! Personally I think one of the drivers has stolen my items! How does one item return back to Amazon the next day but the other 3 items haven’t almost a week one! It’s ridiculous.,0
"All fine, all good. Delivery on time, product was fine. BUT. These geniuses left the product details printed on my gift card, which was a christmas present. Basically my girlfriend realize which present was, just reading the gift card. Unbelievable.",0
"I ordered a set of 4 martini glasses for my brother for Christmas, when the gift arrived it was one large glass. I contacted the company directly and they said the description was wrong on Amazon and would discount my purchase by 35%. I told them I just wanted what was ordered and paid for, they declined. When I contacted Amazon they were no help. They said they would contact the company, they did and my response from the company was the item was delivered and then Amazons response was case closed. This is not the first time that I ordered an item, had a problem and customer service has been no help.",0
"I made an amazon account because i was given an amazon gift card. I purchased a roblox gift card using the amazon gift card, and my amazon account was locked because somehow me buying a roblox card is suspicious. Whatever. I put in my information to get my account unlocked, and a few hours later, my account still wasn't unlocked. However a new notification appeared when i tried to log in saying they reviewed the information i sent but they still need more. It said to follow the instructions in the text message they sent me, but the text message they sent me tells me to log in, but when i log in it tells me i need to follow the text message instructions. Makes sense? No? Great because i was confused too. The text message had no ""instructions"". I called customer service and the tl; dr is ""sorry idk how to help u lol bye"". I thought i would just try again and make a new account, so i did. I tried to load my gift card again and it said the gift card was locked.Tl; dr - amazon locked my account the moment i tried to buy something, and froze my amazon gift card essentially stealing 25 dollars from me with no hope of getting it back.How can you avoid an experience like this?Dont buy from amazon. Buy from the home store of the sellers on amazon. Not only does it keep money out of greedy bezos's pockets, not only can it be cheaper than buying from amazon, but it also helps you avoid every single painful moment i spent on the amazon website. This was quite literally the worst experience ive ever had while on the internet. Dont ask for amazon gift cards for your birthday or christmas. Ask for visa gift cards. Theyre like amazon gift cards except you can buy anything, not just amazon stuff.Final thoughts - my first impressions of amazon are as followed: amazon scammed me out of my money, if your account gets locked (which i guess happens every time you try to buy something?) just give up and delete your account because you aren't gonna get it back. Did you have gift cards loaded onto that account? Say bye bye to that money because you just got scammed. Avoid amazon at all costs.",0
"I spend thousands of dollars annually Amazon and apart from the vast offerings, the service I appreciate most is Amazon's help with the rare bad buying experience. All companies have the occasional customer service glitch or even the really bad transaction. It's how companies respond that distinguishes them, and Amazon in the few instances I've contacted them has always quickly remedied the situation, and in some cases totally exceeded my expectations. I know I can trust Amazon with every purchase I make. Also I love, love, love Amazon Prime video!",2
"Why try to deliver late at night? We are in a business park that has a security gate. I've noted this in the delivery instructions FOR YEARS, yet you still insist on delivering late at night? Items that are listed as next day delivery take a full week or more. I will stop using Amazon and go back to buying my products at a real store.",0
"Just had the worst experience talking to a Manager of customer service department Cristal who is NOT HELPFUL, has 0 product knowledge about the system and does not no what she is talking about. She makes customers more angry, rather than trying to help them and resolve the problem. Very bitchy attitude! Order#:5068",0
"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Amazon Prime has gone completely ""Woke"". What a shame that my family and I try to watch a good wholesome movie on Amazon Prime and we have to be exposed to ads displaying drag queens. Our triune God says ""vengeance is mine"". Hell is a real place. Repent",0

"I always order from Amazon and they never disappoint me. Their shipping, tracking, customer service, website are great.",2
"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and they are great at delivering for free and returns for free. But they have a big problem with their search app.I searched on 10 foot soaker hose and I pressed the Prime button so I wouldn't see non prime stuff. And I got a list that included regular hoses, a bed for the bedroom and lots of other stuff that had nothing to do with hoses. And there were non-prime items in the list and the same item is listed several times. This is normal now with all my searches. And unless I am very focused, I might buy the wrong item. And then I have to go thru the hassle of returning it.",1
Customer service has sadly been degrading steadily by the day.,0
Why do Amazon continue to send delivery confirmation emails when the orders haven’t actually been delivered?When I queried I was told that although I received a delivery confirmation email it can take up to 48hrs after the email for the order to be delivered! Ridiculous!,0
Amazon are great when it goes to plan.  When they don't they are a complete pile of *hit with zero customer service.  I always look elsewhere now rather than deal with this God awful bunch.,0
"I have purchased from Amazon for years but recently decided to go with ""Prime"" and I could kick myself for not doing it many years and dollars ago!  Silly me.  And the Subscribe & Save Program is genius!  Now I order even more - for less price and free shipping.   Love it!",2
"Been using for a few years now.  Excellent at Christmas.  All has turned up on time.  Easy to order.  I have read the bad reviews on here.  Maybe I am just lucky, but I can't fault them on the orders I have made.",2
Amazon is the only place I will go to on line to search for and buy products. They have every item you could think of for sale. I have bought a good few items from them and have never ever had a problem.,2
This site is way too overpriced! They wanted me to pay £12 for a book. I saw that same book for £3 on a different site!,1
Amazon collects my prime membership monthly. This is the 7th month I have been unable to access my account. No amount of robots or letters or consumer complaints have penetrated the layers of their indifference. They simply refuse to help.,0
Okay customer assistance but their shipment is amazing,1
"after spending close to 40000$ on buying from amazon, they just decided to close my account and canceled all gift cards for bo reason . why, because they can and no one can complain about it . but this is way to far to just arbitrarily close an account knowing that we have diffective items that we cant return or exchange. I encourage every one not to be fooled my the name amazon because they don't care at all about customers or services.",0

"I have 2 issues with Amazon. I have an issue with having to send things back via UPS, we don't have a UPS store here. You can, however, print out a label they will send you, and you can put it in the UPS Dropbox, however we don't have those and I don't have a printer! So if I get things that don't fit or I just don't like them I cannot send them back and I'm stuck with them. It gets old. The second issue I have is their packaging. Most of the time you get 1 or 2 small items in a large box, what a waste. sometimes they come in plastic envelopes and are smashed because there's no protection.I'd rather have small boxes because then they fit in the parcel lockers at the Post Office and I don't have to take off of work early to go pick up my packages because they don't fit. I can recycle the cardboard, I just think it's stupid to put a calendar in a box that you could fit 10 pairs of shoes in it. I've contacted them several times about these issues and have yet to see a response. And I use amazon ALOT!",1
"I really love the item range at Amazon.com However, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD) If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me. Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of assistance from Amazon.",1

Joke of a company. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE",0
"They claim to have shipping preference options that are not available. I often choose ""1 day shipping"" only to find out that my order is arriving in 5 days. This is not a pandemic issue, as this has happened before.  Customer service will claim that nothing is wrong, and that it never said 1 day shipping, but believe me, I can read and I know what it said when I ordered. I don't even care if it's delayed, just don't pretend I didn't choose 1 day shipping - it's insulting to be gaslighted like that. Scummy company, and when the pandemic is over I will likely cancel prime and go back to shopping local where people are honest.",0

I am getting completely screwed by Amazon. I have called numerous times. The seller is a complete loser and we never received the merchandise. The tracking information clearly outlines this.

There phone number actually tells you they have stopped providing customer service!!!I'm Buying American Made now and being that everything on Amazon is made in China by the people that sent Covid-19 here for political reasons to kill us, I'll never buy from Amazon again, and I'm really regretting past purchases.",0

"Overall, I do enjoy Amazon. I'm not much of a fan of their Prime Membership, simply because everything I would buy never does fall under their Membership. So it's always an added and unnecessary expense.When that happens you still pay for for the shipping, and then wait for the item to arrive, whenever it gets there, rather than enjoying the 2 day, free shipping that you're paying for with prime.

"Jeff Bezos has the unique privilege on being classified as a rilobber baron alongside many early 20th century figures. Amazon Export Services (AES) employs the cheapest 1* rated companies for international deliveries. It makes it imposdible to record a complaint. It tells a lot of lies on its invoice about how it will handle import processes. In New Zealabd, if your package is worth more than 1000 nzd, for which you have already paid import fees, your package sits in limbo forever. Aramex NZ, which Anazon employs, is a frachisee provider. There is one customs broker who tells a lot of lies about how the the package is due soon, when it has been held by customs for 17days. Mr Azmir Siddiqui (AamirS- his domain name is aramex.com in case you need to put his contact details together) is not inclined to respond to emails. The contact centre is in the phillipines and likely to hang up on you. Aamir is a bottleneck and nothing happens. He probably has too much paperwork in between delivery of 1* rated uber eats. Mr Danny Murphy, supposedluly the Canterbury General Manager of Aramex NZ (1.3* rating only because you cannot rate zero) is uncontactable. This is Amazon for you. The customer can only rate the seller who is not to blame. Customer cannot rate AES. Cunning.",0

Excellent service love them Always going to use them,2
"Amazon charges for Prime service, then offers 2 and 3 day shipping as a benefit for your paying more that $100 annually for it.  However, they reserve the right to break this agreement when it suits them. If for whatever reason they can't get your item to you within the time stated (even though it's listed as a prime item) the excuses from customer service vary from ""The item wasn't in one of our depots"" to ""This item has been delayed and hasn't reached your local facility"" or just plain lies promising the delivery will make it the next day. So don't count on, or expect an item to be delivered when promised. And don't expect to be treated like a ""Prime"" customer when you call for answers. Their customer service supervisors will be rude when they feel like it, and just hang up on you if they want and apparently there's no path of escalation for this behavior. I've canceled all of my recurring subscriptions and will cancel my Prime membership before it renews. Amazon is very convenient, but it's not worth the frustration, stress and rude treatment I've received from their customer service team.",0
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime assistance, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1

"I have had an awful experience with an Amazon purchase.  First, the representative suggested I apply for Amazon Prime credit card because they offer 10 months interest free and my purchase was over $1700.00.  I applied with him but my purchase did not get put under the interest free option so I owe full amount.  I only applied for the credit card for the interest free option.  WHAT A SCAM.Secondly, I picked a delivery date for my item and it is for next month on a Saturday.  I triple checked that I could pick such a date and was assured yes only to find out no.  The delivery company tried to deliver a month ahead of time.  When I called Amazon they lied to me about what had transpired and blamed delivery company.Next, the delivery company contacted me again and this time it is 2 weeks before delivery to tell me they DO NOT DELIVER on Saturday's even though the Amazon Representative said I could pick any date available on the calendar.Lastly, spent over 3 hours talking to Amazon Customer Amazon Service Representatives trying to get all matters resolved and to date, nothing has been resolved to my satisfaction.My advice, DO NOT PURCHASE LARGE FURNITURE ON AMAZON AND DO NOT APPLY FOR THEIR BOGUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS.Completely disappointed with Amazon and the lack of customer service.",0
"I used to love Amazon many many years ago. Back then, when they didn’t deliver on their prime promise, they refunded you your monthly prime fee. Now, so many things go wrong and they don’t hold themselves accountable. 1. The customer support chat is a super hidden feature. I’ve figured out how to access it now, but they make it super hard to get in touch with someone. 2. Deliveries are never on time. They promise next day delivery but many of my orders get delayed. 3. Multiple times I’ve ordered “used- but in good condition” products for a smaller fee to be eco-friendly but many times items of the orders have been missing and it’s on me to package everything up again and haul it to the post office for a return.

Usually the service is excellent and very quick. On the few occasions where there has been a problem Amazon have been quick to sort it out.,2
"Everything about Amazon has went downhill. Packaging is crap, especially for books! Everything arrives damaged. Shipping is horribly slow and Walmart has most items cheaper. Monthly charges for Prime are ridiculous when shipping is so late every time and Prime channel, music and so on has garbage for a selection. Netflix has better movies and tv selections. Amazon sold out and has went in the toilet as their stock declines show.",0

"I have been hacked twice. When trying to log out so this wouldn't happen again, I had a very hard time logging out. Recently I was told when I called Customer Service that I have another email listed besides the one I have used since 2020. I spent an hour on the phone trying to get on my Amazon Prime Video, I gave up. I have canceled my Prime account and will most likely close my Amazon account entirely and order from other companies. I am so frustrated, plus the price of Prime is $15+. Too MUCH.",0
"Amazon has everything, gets it to you fast and coordinates shipments from multiple vendors. I wish their reviews and product info were more extensive, but that's a reflection of individual vendors. Shop around to find out what you want, then buy it (cheaper) at Amazon and get multiples items all at once.",2
"Their customer support has declined severely in the last few years. They only solve my problem about 30% of the time now with some struggle when before it was always one and done with very positive usage. Now, not so much...",1
"Skip the middle man.  Going through Amazon makes it very confusing when one needs to make a return or exchange.  However, Amazon has rectified any problems, but it's hard to know if one is communicating with Amazon or the original seller.",1
Their customer service is dreadful.,0
ive had on the whole a very pleasant interaction with amazon. I have recommended it to friends,1
"Sorry to say that 3´rd party sellers hide behind the fact that Amazon does not want to be involved in their sales and the quality of it. Amazon, in my view act similar to a fence. When someone sells something so ordinary, such as the quality of a CD film, how can you as a private buyer stop them from selling more junk to the public ?This type of sellers don´t want any ratings, so from there they are protected from further scam. When the item had been sold for a low price the you completely loose in the transaction as you don´t want to be involved in a return fight where you absolutely don´t know wher it will stop. Amazon gives strong indication that they do not care selling such low quality items as it is impossible to contact them and with no rating activated for the seller, there is not much you can do and impossible to warn others.",1
Very good experience shopping with Amazon.....One of the best e commerce I see.,2
"This review is regarding Amazon and their misleading advertisements, which this is hardly the first time they have been accused of such and likely not the last settlement they have to pay out due to misleading statements. During the wake of our current pandemic they choose to keep profits high by making unachievable promises to unsuspecting customers regarding their shipping policies. I also a fool agreed to sign up with Amazon prime and pay 119$ a year for this two day shipping reward. As I checkout excited at the decision I made only to discover I will be lucky to receive my shipment in 3 weeks. Upon inquiring with a customer service representative they chose to guilt me as of why I expect my shipment as previously promised to me two minutes prior when they are too busy sending out medical equipment for healthcare professionals. Of course we all understand the need and importance of medical equipment at a time like this, but why are you tricking people into signing up if you know that you aren't able to supply what is promised. Of course her response was, ""well just cancel your order then."" Which of course can be done, but it's the principal of it all and their willingness to profit off of the unsuspecting and unaware. We all know how this works, no one remember to cancel in time or they are elderly or disabled and unsure of the process. Now they are not even required to supply what is advertised. Most would be understanding had they been truthful at the start, but to fabricate and make false statements and to guilt customers for asking for what was just offered to them is bad business in itself. Now had I signed up a year ago and there was no way of predicting the outcome of what could happen it would be reasonable, but covid 19 has been present and affecting all for months now. If you can't supply as promised then take the advertisement down instead of continuing to mislead consumers. Of course our star customer service members response was now, ""I don't know why they haven't took down the advertisement yet, they are probably busy with all this covid stuff."" My....how I should chose my words wisely....as if removing a single line of advertisement will take months to do. While they are so busy saving the world from Covid 19. Thank you Amazon. I got a laugh at least, even if I didn't get my shipment. Until next time, which will be sooner than you think.",0
"Amazon is a very helpful site to find alot of thing that you would want or need, but some sources that sell items on amazon are not trustworthy. I ordered something over a month ago and it didn't arrive, so I asked for a refund, i received half of what I paid for. Unless the goodss come from amazon itself, other sources might not be trustworthy.",1
"I used your website for years and literally spent over $10,000. I can no longer support a website that doesn't value freedom, and quite literally inserts itself to make a political statement against a difference of opinion. I cancelled my Prime, and will shop else where. I'm not American but if this is allowed to stand it means more censorship going forward that you have no right to control. You are a online seller not a political party, or a party who gets to dictate free speech. I hope it was worth losing customers over.",0
normally on time and always cheap,2
it is a usfeul company. My son has purchased things fro Amazon and he is satisfied with.,2
I wonder what's happened at Amazon. The customer support levels through the floor compared to what it used to be. I've had so many issues with incorrect items being sent this year only. Fortunately the support on the Amazon UK side has actually been decent enough for me to continue using Amazon overall,1
"Another terrible experience with Amazon.If you talk with their customer service, they don't care. They just copy paste those ridiculous sentences without solving your problem at all. Ebay is much better (and cheaper), your local shop is much much better. Anything is better than amazon.My life and my economy is much better since I don't buy from them.",0

"I have been using Amazon more and more. I can always find the products I am wanting. Unusual items can be found and with prime delivery it is hassle free. The app is so easy to use. I love it. Only small downside is that some of the next day deliveries don’t arrive on time however these are few and far between. On occasions I gave gad to contact customer services, they have resolved the issue. Returns are easy. Overall a very happy customer. ",2
"Ok I am a prime member ""maybe not for long"" i placed a last week 7/7/19. I was supposed receive 2 of my products on the 10th and 1 between the 10th and 12th. I was surprised when i received that order ahead of the other 2. The package was damaged and the product didnt preform like i thought it would have none the less that could have been me expecting more from the product. Anyway the other 2 products i still haven't received and today is 7/15/19 so i text customer service to tell them about it and how i was a dissatisfied prime member and all he wanted to due was cancel my order and refund me my money. When explained that i needed these items and i didn't want to refund because that would ultimately delay me even longer. He just said pretty much i am just like many other prime members that pay for a service witch made feel unappreciated and like a number worst customer service ever. So told him i would call later when i had time. So i called explained to customer service again and told them how I have been a loyal member for years paying monthly membership fees and i expected to be compensated for the inconvenience and all this crap. And what would you know another slap in the face with a 5 dollar credit to my account for next time i order bull crap. I told them i will probably be canceling my membership and if they wanted to make things right they can fill my order in my cart for the inconvenience. It was only one item i have in my cart and they told me that would not be possible. So if you plan on becoming a prime member I would advise against it because they really don't care about you as a person and only care about there money and not there loyal members.",0
I often ordered from Amazon and the shipment always arrives to my doorstep in shortest possible time. It is always well packed and I can follow the route of the ordered goods.,2
"I am giving the third star reluctantly; I would rather only give 2 1/2 out of 5 stars, as my feelings about the company are 50/50.  As far as prompt order and fair pricing goes, Amazon is second to none.  Unfortunately, it is obvious that several of the reviews on the site are bogus, and until recently they would even allow trolls to write ""counter reviews"" to legitimate criticisms.  Where they really falter is in customer assistance.  I was locked out of my account for unknown reasons and I had to go through a whole rigmarole trying -- unsuccessfully -- to get back into it.  The belligerent, unapologetic operator I spoke to was acting as if I had put HIM out.  I couldn't take it anymore and disconnected the call.  Later, I was inexplicably able to access my account but it was no thanks to them.  They really need to clean up their act.  Goodness knows they can afford to.",1
"Amazon now is making a habit of notifying customers that their order has been delivered, when in fact, it was not delivered. And when you call to ask why, I am told that many times the system will mark a package delivered when it was not delivered. I have to wait 24 hours, and if I still do not find the package, I can claim I never received it. Amazon used to brag about being ""customer eccentric"", now I understand why I'm not seeing that anymore.",0
"Had some issues with order secret santa present. Wasn't the quality that it looked, and requested refund.",0

"despite returning the defective order, they refused to issue refund and i was left with no choice but to dispute the charge",0
"Ordering decents, no issues, however the so called amazon prime is hit and miss, and when you complain they extend it by 1 month....why when it doesn't work as intended, if you purchased next day order elsewhere it arrives.",1
"Worst customer service!After all, customer service is what keeps a business going, yet how is this scam of a company still going? They should not be allowed to trade in how they treat their customers!They do not care when packages get lost in transit whether they are sent back or received or even got stolen because they left them on my doorstep. They simply say ""we can't refund you"" with no reasons, then they decide to end the chat, before you get a chance to reply!Second of all, how the hell are you ment to do a complaint against a customer service representative when they say ""we will give feedback to that person"" no you idio*, I want to make a complaint against the person not giving them dam feedback to them!",0
"Good pricing, decent goodss, but when they mess up, they mess up ordinary with little to no compensation.I’ve bought from Amazon many times.  When their customer assistance agents say someone will get back to you, know that they will never get back to you.  Have heard that at least a dozen separate times and never once has anyone got back to me.They can usually correct things pretty quick, but the problems thst get them there are usually pretty ordinary and they do nothing or very little to mitigate the issue.Overall I still buy from them because of the pricing but I am starting to slow down on purchases because their poor resolution on multiple problems has had me spend way too much time on the phone with them correcting their mistakes while I am actually paying to correct them for them, by being a customer.I have also caught them in their own policy lies and have it recorded where the agent refuses to put in writing what he says on the phone, even though he will put other things in writing.  I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.  Unbelievable.I think this company is dealing with the massive influx of sales during the pandemic and though I have little sympathy for the trillions in profit... overall they do pretty decent job... when they mess up it can be pretty ordinary... but usually they don’t mess up and usually things will sort out.  I wish I could more easily support Canadian retailers though.",1

"Been using Amazon for 12 years, when I first started using everything was great, but since Covid the assistance has been lacking when it come to order time and the third party sellers.

"Amazon wasted a lot of my time.  First of all, Amazon.com kept telling me that my password was wrong and it was right.  I have 2FA so I'm pretty safe, but Amazon made me change my password and THEN didn't recognize it for multiple tries.  Once I got on the site, I tried to use filters to find a monitor that was a specific size, had speakers, etc., and I got so many irrelevant choices that I wound up ordering a monitor I didn't want and had to return it.  About the only thing good was Amazon seemed to make it easy to return the monitor I didn't want, but I spent a whole work day trying to find it and then it's still not returned because UPS hasn't picked it up yet.  But they will, I suppose.",0
Parcels NOT delivered yet again. Items returned back to depot and not even out for delivery the next day. Phoned up Amazon who tells me it's not a guaranteed delivery service. What does this mean???? Does this mean you can order something but we as customers can't guarantee it will even be delivered not just on time but at all. I hope the Amazon group collapse within the next couple of years. Awful company.,0
"I am not crazy about Amazon  especially in the near future due to most store fronts closing down. Amazon is the lead reason for this not   Covid 19 or any  pandemic. Just look around at empty malls or more and more  stores closing in all areas. Think about it, aren't you going to miss family events when shopping together  example school shopping, spring break, summer time,  clubbing, vacation shopping, walking, ice cream and at the end of your shopping spree day with your family. Finally dinning in to a nice restaurant  to mingle with your family and friends. Ps. also won't you miss trying on your new  bikini  with your friends?          Pss. I don't know about you, but I LOVE to try before I Buy. Or having this beautiful day shopping with your family. Or you can just sit at home alone in front of your computer and order everything you want, then return it when it wasn't exactly what you wanted or didn't fit  from Amazon.",0

"Ordered an item that cost $317 compared to the MSRP of $449. Received the order quickly, but because somebody at the warehouse put the correct stock label on the wrong product I was sent an item that was completely wrong and with a price point $165 less than what I ordered. Customer service has been an absolute nightmare trying to get the return set up. First I had to e-mail photos of the packaging and everything else to which their reply was that it was invalid and I had to re-submit the exact same thing all over again. Finally got the approval for a return. Second they tell me they can't replace the incorrect item with the correct one and that I would have to get a refund and try ordering again. Then they couldn't send me the correct e-mail with the correct return shipping labels for me to print to apply to the return box. It took 8 different emails to finally get the right link to print the proper labels. Sent the item back by USPS with a tracking number on 6/27 and it was delivered on 6/29. The return center took 4 days until 7/3 to finally acknowledge it as received and it would take 2-3 days to process the refund and another 2-3 for the refund to appear back on my card.It's now been nearly two weeks and I still haven't gotten my refund. Call to find out what is going on and I'm told that I can't get refunded until I send back the correct item. Because of their moronic mistake of putting the correct stock label on the incorrect item their system shows that I received the correct item. It was shown with photographic proof in the initial return photos that the label with the correct item name/number was literally 3 inches away from the incorrect name/number on the product box it was placed on, but they're too incompetent to get that through their heads. I can't return what I never received. Now it's just one big runaround to get these scumbags to give me my money back. These incompetent morons will never get another dime from me after this ridiculous hassle over a simple return of their stupid mistake.",0

"Amazon Prime member for many years.  Getting very disillusioned with Prime shipment/promised shipment dates. Prime promises same day, next day, two day shipment depending upon the goods you order.  1) I expect delay of specific or some goodss due to COVID-19; and, 2) I understand not all goodss can be delivered in a day.  However, it's now October and I would expect Amazon to have worked-out the majority of promised shipment vs. actual shipment issues, regardless of whether it is an Amazon issue or Prime vendor issue.  Of the orders I have placed over the past 2-3 months, 80%+ have arrived later -- sometimes MUCH later -- than the shipment date stated/selected when I order.  In general, it is an inconvenience.  In principle, Amazon is not fulfilling the terms of their PAID Prime Service.  I would much rather order a goods and get an HONEST, REALISTIC shipment date than continue to get notifications that the goods I've ordered is delayed.  In some cases, I would not use Amazon if I knew that my order would not arrive for as much as a week to 10 days after the original shipment date.  Prime is a paid Service, with specific consumer promises.  Amazon needs to fulfill these promises or change them.  In all fairness, prior to COVID-19 the percentages of late packages was probably reversed (20% late/80% on time).  COVID is a challenge for everyone, and Amazon needs to step up to the plate to adjust their business practices to it.Side note:  First tried to review/leave feedback on the Amazon site but I'm ineligible to review Prime Service there.  Go figure...",1

Ive been using amazan for years but they have seriously gone down hill , 3 times now no show .. parcels , first two excuses were item unable to be delivered damaged , took 3 weeks for a refund. Now they say its been delivered and they handed it to resident .. well my ring door bell says differently ??? There was no delivery at all .. what a sham amazan is now thats it for me amazan can do one ....",0
Good for customers but a nightmare for sellers! Their customer-centric policies make it difficult for sellers to make a profit as the company would accept a return from customers even if the customer has damaged the goods beyond repairs!,1
placed an order with amazon and got my order 3 weeks later very slow shipping,1
"The Amazon shipping practice is ridiculus.  If you purchase enough to receive free shipping without a Prime membership, they wait a week or more to actually ship the items.  This has been the consistent experience.  It is very frustrating.  I try to find a marketplace seller or check Walmart for free 2 day shipping.  Not at all satisfied with my experiences.",0
"ok assistance, pretty acceptable prices for most of the things you can find.Sometimes shipment is super fast and sometimes it is delayed, you never know what's coming.But in most cases, the top wait is a week.",1
"I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.",1
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their assistance, their items and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer assistance representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
"Amazon have really messed me about, not one order in the last month has gone smoothly. But they have put things right everytime. Just wished I didn't have to keep making complaints. However Amazon Prime is great and the Fire Stick is amazing. So come on Amazon sort the order process out so we can have a decent assistance.",1
"I think the order was professionally handled, but it took nearly two weeks to arrive.",1
Ordered a gold plated chain for fancy dress party but got delayed in customs for two weeks due to brexit and hence pointless. Shouldn’t be advertised to be delivered as two days shipment,1
Issue after issue I give up now Amazon gone down hall soo much,0
"Obviously a decent shop; however, there's scammers working at Amazon—make sure the reviews are legitimate.",1
"Amazon alwqays has fast delivery times, and their customer service is excellent .",2
"As other customers have reported, drivers just leave the parcels on the doorstep and disappear. We have made 6 complaints about this recently, which have been ignored. The last straw was today when we found sheepskin slippers on the doorstep absolutely dripping wet. We have cancelled our prime account and got a refund. If only they would listen.",0
Same day delivery was great. I also used a 5% discount code which appeared on screen so that was a bonus.,2
Terrible service Amazon fresh store code didn't work called assistance when they answered was transferred 7 times and left on hold for about an hour total call time was 1 hour 40 mins in total then was told that they could seem to find the problem and then told they would call me back within 24 hours absolute waste of my time  for no reason,0
"I've been a faithful amazon.com user for many years now. Some of the sellers on the site do not have the merchandise they claim or in the condition which they claim it to be. Having said that, Amazon stands by the consumer and will make it right for you. I've come to trust them. It can be a little inconvenient having to go through the return process. But, Amazon makes it as easy as possible, making sure you get even your postage back. So, just be cautious when purchasing from companies you're not familiar with. And, should the item(s) not be what you thought, know that Amazon will protect you.",2
"Amazon customer service is Appalling!  I needed to return two damaged items and went through the returns process online.  The courier arrived on 3 occasions to collect them.  Each time with a car when, as items are heavy and bulky, a van is needed.  After each failed attempt I have contacted customer service by live chat and telephone.  Further collections were supposedly arranged with Hermes who didn’t turn up even after I waited in on days for them.  At this point I had contacted them at least 8 times.  The whole experience was utterly frustrating.  On 2 occasions the call was disconnected.  Eventually Amazon customer service told me I have to arrange my own courier and they will refund.  However, I tried again and, after explaining all the details again, this assistant said she went through to the large items department and had arranged the collection for the following Tuesday.  Again a courier didn’t turn up.  I tried to contact Hermes direct.  They only provide digital chat.  I inputted the parcels tracking number and waited about a week for a digital response which said they couldn’t locate the parcel.  I then went online to arrange my own courier.  The cheapest courier costs £126 yet the item cost £90.  I contacted Amazon again to check they would refund this large amount.  He said yes.  But as so many CS advisers have told me different things I don’t trust anything they say.  I am now left with two large and heavy items unlike want or can afford to fork out £126 for their return.  It definitely is the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced and I will not buy anything through them again.",0
"Absolute disgrace of a company.Biggest pile of frauds I have ever came acrossThey provide no support for thier third party sellers whatsoever, and then brag on about how they give small business the opportunity to sell on the worlds biggest platform, they just screw you, as long as they are covered.",0
we bought a hot tub from Amazon which we had to return as faulty and they gave us a refund and we bought another one. We returned the item and showed proof of this with tracked return and then 30 days later they sent a message saying reversed the refund and they had taken the money out of our account- nearly £500 which we has caused us to have no money in account and when we phoned they agreed they had made a mistake and said they would rectify but would take 5 days leaving us with no money. they made the mistake and disgusting and not willing to do any  more about it but said this is rare scenario and should not cause inconvenience to you. Unbelievable,0
"I love the convenience of ordering online, however the order system for this company fails in many ways by having ""lazy"" order individuals deliver the items. I have had items wet, muddy, run over, and simply lost in a place not visible to retrieve them. This is an ongoing problem with Amazon. They need their own trucks and driver to eliminate this problem.",1
A lesson in good service,2
"I will not buy from Amazon again..Missing items in package, then they ask for proof of missing item (how the hell do you do that 🙄)  refund process is far too long, (doesn't take long for them to collect the payment though) and very tiresome.. never again ",0
Driver just opened front door rather than wait for someone to answer. Why is the driver evening trying the door. Contacted Amazon but support is non existent.,0
"I use amazon.com for nearly all my online shopping! Even if I can't find everything I'm looking for directly on the site, it is a great starting point.",2
"Amazon has been pretty helpful for most occasions. Sometimes their third world customer service associates have difficulty understand what I am trying to explain in email, but they do try their best to guide me on what I need to do. Refunds are easily dealt with if you purchase directly from Amazon, make sure you read return policies for third party sellers using Amazon as a platform.",2
"Price, delivery, customer service are all excellent.",2
"Amazon must get through a vast amount of packaging which ends up in our bins.  I know it's mainly cardboard, but the Amazon Prime Tape they use to stick it is not.  It's still single use packaging which is a waste in any case.I wish they would take a lead from Ocado. Each time Ocado make a shipment, they take away the packaging from their last shipment and use it again.",1
Always had a great interaction except for the one last time. i will come back edit this review if I have a decent interaction next time.,1
"Every time the Amazon delivery drivers drop off packages at my apartment building, they buzz every apartment. It has become increasingly bothersome to several other tenants, so I tried to contact amazon about it. They told me unless I had the persons name and order number, there is no way they can fix the issue, which I don’t have. Needless to say, most of us have stopped ordering on amazon, as they will do nothing to fix this issue.",0
Amazon has consistently earned my praise for fast shipping and quality products.  I will continue to purchase items from them.,2
"Our account was hacked and they knew of hundreds of attempts worldwide. After a week of straightening that mess out, I was banned from leaving reviews of products and services. There is an affiliate or subsidiary called Amazon Marketplace that ALWAYS sends used, damaged, and defective goods. (But don't tell anyone.)",0
"Amazon's customer assistance has declined over the last years. Their 2 day shipping for prime members is great, but when there's an issue with an order their customer assistance lacks the support that they should be providing. ",1
"I wish they sucked, because they want world domination and thats not decent for the world. they are pretty decent at what they do. However I often find lower prices on walmart.com and or other smaller online stores.",1
Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1
"I use Amazon a lot. And for the most part it's fine. However just recently it's been a bit of a joke. A couple of items arrived damaged. Thankfully it's just the box not the goods itself but it makes you wonder about how they treat your items. Then I also pay for Amazon Prime, the idea being next day order. Ordered an item and didn't receive it next day. Following day I got a notification to say it would arrive with a couple of additional items i bought as accessories for my main item. The additional items came but not the main one. Message from them saying there was a problem and I was to wait 2 more days and then I could request a refund. Wasn't sure if that meant I wasn't getting it or not, even though it said they would redeliver it 2 days later (3 days after the order date I pay a premium for). But why even bring up the option of a refund if you intend to deliver my item? Then at just before 2am, I get a message saying I won't get it at all. And I will get a refund in a couple of days. So I pay a premium for you to make me wait longer than expected and then not send the item and make me wait for a refund. No explanation either. It's really annoying. Makes me think twice about using them again and makes me wonder about Prime membership.",1
Always happy with their customer service. I just wish that they have a better quality control/check on the products sold as sometimes the quality is not so good.,2
"I used to love amazon. I've been a solid customer for over 8 years. Probably spend over $5,000 a year with them. More and more with each passing year. Now their assistance has gotten worse, prices increased, and more and more shipping problems. Amazon get your act together.",1
Fast Shipping & Great Products! Highly recommend!!,2
Very slow still waiting for a package to be delivered from usa to berlin!!,1
the luggage was not as big as they show in checkout phase. ,1
"Recently I made 4 orders, they were accepted then two of them were out of stock.  That is 50% and totally unacceptable.  If internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control.  Disgruntles Customer.",1
"I absolutely love Amazon! Also, I tried out their Prime membership and it's to die for. I always get quick deliveries and I know that my package will be there when I get home. I have never had any issues with Amazon and I have already recommended it to so many people!If you haven't purchased anything from Amazon I would recommend you do just to try it out. You wont be disappointed.",2

"I’m writing this review to tell the truth about amazon.com. I have been a member for several years and even though I have bought many items of good quality, some of the items sold were in poor state. I am warning customers to do your homework and research the individual sellers. Some of them are not honest and some either were damaged, defective or otherwise false goods. Furthermore, Amazon disallows bad reviews regarding late or in accurate deliveries that failed to arrive on time. This is a concern to me because it appears Amazon is only interested in profits and not customer satisfaction. They need to do better with the respective delivery companies charged with making sure things are delivered on time and to the correct address. It’s inconceivable and inexcusable for Amazon not to properly vet their sellers and deliver to the correct address on time.",0
"ordered an item and package was opened and repackaged, tried to connect with Amazon but they did not answered to why my package was opened when it came",1
"I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program. I had the EXACT book as the website (Same ISB #, same edition, etc.), and they sent it back to me saying it wasn't the right book. A little upset with the whole interaction, but I still like Amazon overall.",1
"Amazon seems to be slipping as to the reliability of the order dates. You know, the ones on the goods detail page. For Example Prime member's, order is stated two days, sometimes three days. these order dates are always stated right on that page. But  following my last purchase, I received a notice that the goods order date had been extended by two or three days. (So I canceled the purchase). And now I find that Prime Video has commercials... COMMERCIALS. Folks, I do not pay a monthly fee for commercials. I get enough of that with Directv. This was one reason I chose a prime membership. I do not pay a monthly fee to have my order date made LATE  by two or three days. The date on the goods details page. (And I always take a screenshot of the page at the time of the purchase) should be the same price and date that the goods is actually delivered. When I purchase goodss from Amazon, I often choose the goods according to the order date and that price and order date should be honored by Amazon. If there are too many deliveries, hire more drivers. There are lots of people wanting jobs right now. Amazon needs to be a little bit more aware of their “little details”, like the order dates. It is now time to purchase items for Christmas. My question is, can I depend on Amazon with delivering the goodss on time? Or are my gifts going to arrive in 2021.",1
"Getting a bit fed up with next day order but is being delivered by Royal mail who don't deliver on Sunday, so not next day at all ....Happening a lot now, Customer support no help at all because you can't get past the silly robot chat nonsense ",1
Posted wrong review!,1
the luggage was not as big as they show in checkout phase. ,1
"Amazon has become the way of the world. We can find anything we need at the edge of our finger tips + 2 day prime shipping?! SIGN ME UP! I’ve worked hand in hand with Amazon and their affiliate program which has been wonderful. I’ve also ordered many of my own personal things through the site as well. From clothes, to toilet paper and even random items like a pineapple carver LOL. They have a large variety of items and various vendors to choose from. The only issue I’ve really ever had is they tend to lose my packages. I even have an Amazon hub at my apartment complex where they can drop off the package directly. It’s always frustrating when something doesn’t arrive on time or gets lost some way some how in transit. However, Amazon has always swooped right in to help save the day. Their customer service is awesome! I’m more of a pick up the phone type of gal. I like that one on one customer service (it must be the sales person in me) but Amazon does also offer a chat service where you can speak to a representative directly. I’ve had phone calls and chats with them but I’ve had instances before where I can’t leave my desk to make a phone call. Easily enough I’ve gotten right on the chat, let them know my package was missing and they have sent a new one right out to me. Easy peasy! I’ve had really great service and have always been satisfied with the overall experience of the company itself. I would highly recommend checking them out!!",2
when i order something it comes broken im very anoyed;;;;;;))))))))))))))))))),1
I really love amazon prime.  Never really had any issues with them.  I did get automatically billed the other day which I was not aware of.  Later found out that it’s an automatic bill cycle once every year.  I guess I should have read that.  Maybe you can guys can send out a reminder on when this is due?  Other than that the service has been awesome for my small business.,2
"Stopped shopping at Amazon this year and closed account after11 years I finally am done, as they have zero intention to hold delivery drivers to account! They lie and claim “package handed to carrier” and everytime they leave in an open foyer unattended and undelivered and open for anyone to take! And make you spend time chasing searching, knocking on doors and calling Amazon, to be told to wait three days incase it finds legs and walks up to your door mysteriously! It’s a joke and places like this only make changes when people stop using them!",0
"I don’t know what has happened to Amazon in recent months but it’s seriously gone downhill. From an exemplary service to poor. 4/10 items either lost or damaged. A small business would fold with those stats.So no more Amazon for me, simply not good enough. 😢",0
"As a matter of fact, amazon had been quite satisfying since I first used their supports years ago.Though, the past few years I find quite annoying their borderline policy about order date. There was a time when that order date was fixed. Now it changes even in previously received mails. The only way to keep track of their promises is to make a screenshot. The most irritating things is that every time you write to complain about undelivered items and warn other users, amazon refuse your review. They even remind you stupidly that your review should focus on the item quality.  How are you supposed to do that without even receiving the item ?",1
"My order was meant to be delivered yesterday, now delayed for another a couple of days. Tracking my order, but it says is still in Luton Dunstable to be dispached to my address in London.  At least they have notified me of the delay.",1

Last year I ordered some jewelry and when I got the package the necklace and braclets were broken. Contact the seller through Amazon and the company that sold them to me said keep them and promptly rushed a new set to me.,2
There shipment is limited. They Should ship all items to singapore I suggest,1
A very good online store. I can buy here anything I need. The feedback system is excellent and helps me to make the right choice in many cases when I am in doubt.,2
"I place orders all the time on Amazon for work and for personal use.  The orders ship quickly, arrive in good condition, in a timely fashion and are exactly what I ordered/ expected.  Their website is one of the most user friendly ones I use daily, so I order from Amazon as often as I can.",2
Good support but poor customer support when it comes to getting the package and having a problem with the shipping.,1
"I have had bad experiences with some retailers and will not use those  companies anymore due to their unpredictable and unreliable delivery times.  I much prefer Amazon because I have the Prime service, which means I can get some items later that day or the next. I even have their credit card and use on the site to earn points.  Such a convenient service during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",2
"Two boxes of 5-hour energy had been opened and the product shuffled before shipping to me.  I contacted Amazon, and they would not take it back.  I tried to write a review, and they would not accept it.  I will be looking for another place to shop.",0
"Have been off and on with Amazon and the Prime membership. Sometimes it is worth it and other times it is not, like when you order a package that says it's prime, then it doesn't show up until a week later. Which has happened multiple times, to the point that I have cancelled several orders for the fact that I knew I was either never getting the item or would never get it for what I was paying for prime to get it to me in a specific timeframe. Ease of access to the pick up items in one day is convenient, but eases of access to such items on the site is rather discouraging.Main thing they need to fix is labeling items as prime that they know acceptable and well will not be shipped in a 2 day or less timeframe. Also the one day shipping fee is a joke.Honestly their conduct of support is only pushing me back to Ebay, who has stepped up their game as far as shopping/shipping and giving a reliable user interaction is concerned.",1
Been a bit delay recently but guess just near the Christmas.,1

Excellent. The prime fee is well worth payingFree next day shipment on many things Free films although I've one one niggle. Not all are free on prime I looked for a film over 20 years old And although I pay for membership they want £5.49 extraI found it elsewhere on DVD for £1.99Ordered it. Now it's mine to keep foreverI never pay their silly prices for film assistance I already pay for,1
Always excellent service and on the rare occasion I had to return something I was refunded very quickly.,2
"Fantastic! Student prime is an absolute godsend - and has saved me from battling the busy shops this festive season. I do find the prices on Amazon can be slightly higher compared to high street retailers sometimes however when it's delivered within 1 day every time, there's no need to complain at all.",2
"I am not keen on giving negative reviews, though Amazon deliveries are regularly lost or damaged. My recent book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable. I spend a whole day at home waiting for the parcel to arrive anytime before 8pm and just after 8 pm I get notified that my book order got canceled because the package was damaged and became undeliverable. I want the old post office back, this on time delivery is nonsense.",0
"I absolutely love Amazon and have been shopping with them for years, but I couldn't believe it when a Botabay Dog Stroller was bought as a gift for my ageing dog from my sister and the description states that it has a rear storage pocket, it doesn't!!! That was one of the main reasons it was purchased. My ageing dog loves it, but we are so disappointed. My sister spent over £205.00 on it.......how disappointing!!!",1
"My items appeared as delivered but never camed. After a conversation with a representative I was told my address is wrong in the system so I provided the correct one. I was advised to call a day later to make a refund request. When i called on the day after , i was told my details are correct and refund cannot be processed unless I provide a police report case that has been already been closed. I spoke with multiple agents from the Philippines and India and it felt as if i was talking to a wall. Hearing the same nonsense. My question is when the courier is Amazon why can't they contact the driver and see what happend . Why am i the one who should contact the police if i have zero fault there. The parcel appeared as deliver on Sunday 4th of the December, when i was in the house the whole day. After checking the doorbell camera there were no movement of any delivery guys.The filipino rep told it was handed to someone. And promise to put me on to a manager. It didn't happen nor i received the callback he promised. The Indian girl said the calls are recorded but i cannot get those. Every Time I called i asked the rep to leave a note of in the interaction records on my account. The same Indian girl told me there were no notes. And while i was having a conversation with her she said thanks and hang up on me. I dont feel that this is how people spending their money on Amazon should be treated.",0
I shouldn’t take 3 days to prepare a order to ship I’ve never seen such a slow an a business that don’t care about there customers time to step up a few levels Amazon an customer service.,0
Amazon has gotten alot more over seas and not so trust worthy sellers. Used to be able to just buy from Amazon and it was great. Now I have to check every seller thats not amazon themselves for reviews.,1

"Amazon's Preston warehouse has thieves working out of it. Some of you might be aware of the recent incidents of people buying PS5's from Amazon and upon delivery the console box had been opened and the console taken out the box and then delivered to customers. Well this also happens when you buy a mobile phone. Ordered a OnePlus 9 model (most recent model) and upon delivery took the phone box out of the outer packing and immediately noticed the seals had been cut and upon opening the phone box found the phone had been removed. I spent over 2 hours trying to get in touch with someone at Amazon who understood the situation but was bounced around the Philippines, Columbia and the Caribbean before getting through to someone in the UK who understood the situation. I was offered £5 as a good will gesture which you'll agree was insulting so did not accept it and was assured a member of management would contact me to discuss further and have not received a call, no surprise there being it's Amazon. The agents I spoke to we're more interested in trying to cover up and ignore the fact they have thieves working in their Preston warehouse, basically trying their best to brush it under the carpet. Next step is the police and the press to report the theft and I hope anyone who reads this will think twice before purchasing a high priced or sought after item from Amazon...I assure you you'll have issues and then more issues trying to resolve it with their utterly useless customer services. It shows how little Amazon thinks of its customers as they don't even monitor their own trust pilot and respond to reviews, they're so big now they simply don't care about criminality within their own company. You've been warned, purchase from Amazon at your own risk.",0
Amazon is great. You get almost everything there and they have very good service to offer.,2
I am not happy nor sad. I bought LR44 cell.,1
"Amazon was my go to until I noticed an issue for items I hadn't received or purchase I didn't make or returned and I keep getting insufficient fund notices. Eventually was locked out of my account fr fraudulent activity, get back in and it happened several times. I have many devices linked to that account such as echo and fire tablet as well as fire sticks. It is a great inconvenience and the customer support has suffered and not pleasant t deal with for resolving issues. He there's the new found fees for everything even that which use to be free. I have been a vip customer for years today I use other sites because f the new found issues. I hope things get better or I will not be using them in the ear future.",1

"Amazon charges for Prime service, then offers 2 and 3 day shipping as a benefit for your paying more that $100 annually for it.  However, they reserve the right to break this agreement when it suits them. If for whatever reason they can't get your item to you within the time stated (even though it's listed as a prime item) the excuses from customer service vary from ""The item wasn't in one of our depots"" to ""This item has been delayed and hasn't reached your local facility"" or just plain lies promising the delivery will make it the next day. So don't count on, or expect an item to be delivered when promised. And don't expect to be treated like a ""Prime"" customer when you call for answers. Their customer service supervisors will be rude when they feel like it, and just hang up on you if they want and apparently there's no path of escalation for this behavior. I've canceled all of my recurring subscriptions and will cancel my Prime membership before it renews. Amazon is very convenient, but it's not worth the frustration, stress and rude treatment I've received from their customer service team.",0
What a waste of space Amazon is sent a Xbox game out to me to open the item to then notice that disc is scratched I then got onto Amazon to be able to return the item witch I have done and now I have to so called wait till 3feb 2023 robbing me outa my own money,0

"I use amazon for years now and never had any issues, I always found customer support very fine. However this time everything changed. I ordered a little balance bike for my sons birthday specifically. Was waiting for over a week for it to be dispatched but noticed nothing was happening. I contacted amazon to check up on it the day beforw it was due to arrive and they send me an email that my order was cancelled due to stock availability. When I ordered the bike it was in stock so how can they sell items that are not in stock?!!  Also if there was an issue like that that could of informed me so I could shop elsewhere. If it wasn’t me chasing them I don’t even know if they would of let me know at all!!! I contacted them again and it didn’t feel like they cared at all. I do understand current circumstances but you just can’t put smth out for sale when it’s not in stock?!?! Now I ended up having no gift for my sons birthday. Never was So disappointed tbh. It sucks.",1
Excellent customer services who listen and have a good speed to answer.  Great prices and quick delivery along with a massive collection of products and sellers.  Good reviews of each item and a well structured/searchable site.  The list goes on!  Get involved if you havent already!,2

I had been frustrated about the products that I returned to Amazon Returns : ( 1)Two packages of 2 Arctic pants were arrived Amazon Return place. ;  LEX2 E1 AMAZON RETURNS, 201 S CHICAGO AVE , BOX 515, SAINT ANNE IL  60964  ,but money returned only for  one pant.(2) A package of Biology Quiz Deck was arrived Amazon Return place :  LEX1 O2 AMAZON RETURNS, 1850 MERCER RD., LEXINGTON, KY , 40511  ,but money had not be transferred to my account.(3) The U.S. Constitution Knowledge Cards Deck  Sold by: Oasis1270. I printed the return label .This label was odd,there was no address on the return label. !! The return label suppose to have the address on there. I contacted the seller 2 days ago. There is no reply from seller. So I contacted Amazon Customer Service. There were many problems that happened, they made me feel frustrated. Since CHEVAUHN  helped me with cool temper and patient, I am glad. Now I am waiting for my money to be transferred to my account and waiting the return address from Oasis .  OASIS should put the return address on the return label. So it helps to save time both buyer and customer service.",2

"Okay so my problem with amazon originally started as my fault, i put the wrong address. Instead of putting west I put east. On the day of the delivery the driver called me, I apologized and gave him the correct address, and he told me he would update the address and I would get it delivered the following day. Cool.So the following day I check my shipping address at 6 am, and it wasn't corrected. I did the chat thing and the chatter informed me that she added it to the delivery instructions. Skeptical, I called in and the lady on the phone confirmed with me I would receive the package today at the corrected address.A few hours go by and I receive a call from the driver that he was at the wrong address, yet again, and when I gave him the corrected address he said it was outside of his delivery zone.So I call in again and after a 30 minute phone call of just trying to update my address for the following day, the guy told me he updated the notes and address. Address was still incorrect and delivery notes were deleted and he put that I wanted my order the following day.So I then do the chat thing again and they inform me to replace the order and I would get a full refund, which would've worked but I had ordered the last item in stock. So I ask if I can update the address and they tell me no and ask if I want to speak to a specialist.I understand the mistake was originally my fault but it is a simple mistake and I was willing to wait a few days to accommodate that but they have no basic understanding of what I am asking for.",0
"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 goodss that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 goods that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of goodss, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1
nice site to grab items from a list of trusted vendors.,2
"Has it's acceptables and has its ordinarys... Not sure what outweighs what.Having Prime means next day order - more and more frequently order is being delayed. When you are able to speak to an agent, they offer compensation however this is never actually applied to your account. The last adviser I spoke to Hazel was very rude. I attempted to report her however was unable to do so.",1
Refund not returned within 7 days as promised. Live chat unwilling to help. Extended it to 14 business days and asked me to call back,0
Good customer service only had problem with decision time cause little bit longer that’s why I gave 4 star,2
I have absolutely loved Amazon in the past but the last couple of months they have really disappointed me. I’m a Prime subscriber and have normally received my purchases in several days. Perfect! But lately it has been taking weeks….to not at all! Has anyone else been experiencing this. I’m truly bummed and disappointed as all get out!,1
Advertising of Bros on Prime Video is offensive.  I don't want to see it every time I open Prime Video.Guess I will not open Prime Video for a while.,0
"Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their goods line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s decent name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the goodss they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!",1
the buy and order is fine. but lately i reviewed some items that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing fine to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer assistance woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer assistance calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after order before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other goodss minutes after order.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1
I wish I could rate of zero I’ve had those experience with Amazon! The customer service representatives do not understand English most of them are overseas. Manager was totally belligerent has no empathy for anything I waited over 10 hours for UPS to come pick up the package and all she did was cancel my return expecting me to wait another day at home with no resolution,0
"Amazon was always my go to, mainly because of the 2 day shipping. The order times have been very inconsistent for the past few months and a few items were canceled even though notifications were sent that the merchandise was out for order. Seriously considering not renewing my prime membership...",1
"We sent something back via hermes, over 17 days ago and it says attempt for collection was made. They collected it, amazon say its not returned. But they wont sort this. Now its escalated joke .",0
"The delivering of packages was place directly in front of our storm door, making access to the package impossible.  Your Drivers need to either knock on the door first, or to place packages away from the door,  This is inexcusable behavior and makes your company look foolish.  If you would like me to teach all your drivers and package delivers I will be glad to do so at a modest salary.  I would expect much better from the supposed leader of the industry",0
"There is literally no customer assistance here, you pay for ‘prime’, order a ‘prime’ item. They take your ‘prime’ payment and then don’t deliver according to the ‘prime’ order timescales- WHAT’S THE POINT????! I may aswell go Argos for the same price and save myself the head ache of speaking to these half wits and save myself £7.99 a month for NOTHING! Literally thanks for nothing Amazon.Update 11/09/2022, Amazon have given I £5 credit on my account for the inconvenience which goes some way towards building my confidence and trust for the company.",1
"My review is little bit different. I used amazon as a store and it is great. But my review is about their cloud service. I just wanna say that the Amazon is the best in every sphere. They have virtual servers,  virtual, private clouds.",2

"I was forced to receive an item I no longer wanted because Amazon did not let me cancel the order despite it not being shipped until much later the next day. 3-4 hours after I placed the order and I can't cancel it? BS. Regardless, I received the item on a Saturday but it was delivered after UPS store hours so I couldn't send it back the same day as planned. I was only available again on Tuesday to dropoff at the UPS store (which I did first thing that morning) and 2 days later I have no tracking information for an item that only had to travel 200 miles from me. They are trying to say I have to wait until the end of the month if I don't receive any information on the status of my return before then. It was a very expensive SSD and they are just holding my money hostage for something that was their error. Horrible company, customer service nowhere to be found. I am considering cancelling prime in 2023 just for this reason alone.",0

"Prices are very high, buyers are hardly ever protected, especially international customers using freight company address for shipping-just like me. Amazon allows drop shipper sellers who are not aware what they are dispatching. If your item is not as described you are experiencing monetary loss. Regarding customer assistance: it used to be very fine back in the years but now most of them are sleepy and I even have a feeling that they did not understand English and they are using some online dictionary to see what you wrote, frequently they provide with irrelevant answers. Not all of them but most do. Amazon VS eBay-better buy on eBay, eBay has unbeatable prices at least.",1
i ordered goods using amazon prime  less  than 15 hours i just got it fantastic service highly recommend amazon prime,2
Thanks  for getting my order delivered succesfully,2
"So I order all the time off of Amazon, never had to many complaints until recently. They have shipped a few wrong orders, though I was able to get them replaced fairly easily, it was hours on the phone, and running in to mail a package back to them. The reason I ordered from Amazon with that purchase was that I needed it fast with the wrong order being sent twice was not able to use it. Then even more recently I have found that all the Amazon apps are kinda completely annoying. I used to have kindle, shopping, video and music apps. The problem is that when I tried to use my husband's account that has prime for the shopping app and my account for everything else, it would sign me out of all the apps on my phone. There seems to be no option to sign in with different accounts for different apps. Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download. Extremely frustrating.",1
I was supposed to receive 3 parcels today one of which was a birthday present non of them arrived even though it states that they had been posted through my letter box tried to chat with chat box who advised me that they have completed delivery information and they have not been delivered and to re contact them if I do not receive them by the 22/11/23 this is not the first experience of not receiving my parcels and it is not acceptable,0
"The drivers give no f*cks about doing their job correctly.  2 packages in 2 weeks stolen because the drivers don't read or can't read notes and numbers.  I've received 2 of my neighbors packages because they can't read the address numbers 2 feet above where they dropped the package or didn't want to walk to the back of my condo.  They did like to take pictures showing they didn't bother reading the notes for deliveries.  Next issue... John makes t shirts and sells them at $15 each.  Amazon says they'll buy all his tshirts at $5.  The stores he sold too can't get their supply because Amazon bought them all.  Amazon sells them online at $8 each your shop sold them at $16.  Your shop tried to make $1 profit.  John took a cut and probably a small loss that could put his production out of business.  Customers refuse to go to either one because they can get then cheaper on Amazon.  Don't buy Amazon!  Wal-Mart does the same thing but Amazon put john in bankrupty and then bought John's business for pennies.  You May want it cheaper but you're hurting small businesses for the convenience of ""1 day delivery""",0

"Fifth time in a row that a preorder has been delayed or changed. Says it comes out today but won’t ship til A MONTH (actually two months) after release, but yet it tells me it’ll be here Monday. I was also lied to by CS for the $10 coupon. Was also told ticket was escalated and will be shipped in 24 hrs (I highly doubt it). They tried to deflect asking where exactly it says it’ll show up on that day when it’s RIGHT ABOVE THE PICTURE IN FRONT OF THEM! I don’t what’s going on with their preorders but it’s gotten to be god awful. I get news that other people that order at the same get theirs but yet mine gets delayed. It’s getting to when I just cancel all my orders and don’t use you all as a place holder til I find it somewhere else. They just turning into a joke of a company",0

Amazon is a worthy competitor to Walmart. The vast variety of choices coupled with excellent customer service makes Amazon one of my two choices for just about everything I need. ,2
"Locked me out of my account, then customer service tried to tell me that my debit card was never used on that account when I called.  What? That was the card I used to pay for amazon prime, and the same card I used to make all my purchases on Amazon.  Never actually sent my amazon credit card, so after getting locked out of the account I had no way of actually paying off the balance of the thing, so my credit will be taking a hit over Amazon's incompetence. I just don't have the time or energy to list every problem I've had with them, but Amazon is garbage and I hope people realize that soon. Seems strange that as soon as you find off-site reviews they don't look anything like the ones posted to Amazon huh?",0
Service is fine. easy to order.,1
I’ve always had excellent buying experiences with Amazon. I’ve made countless purchases over the years. The website has everything. The clear filtering format makes the process quicker to find what you want vs wasting time. My deliveries usually come on time but on occasion deliveries have been left outside behind bins etc.,2
Amazon only allows reviews that make them look good. If a vendor is absolutely terrible send you complete junk and then screws you over don't bother mentioning it because you will be blocked. Amazon will never let you give a negative review even if it allows you to give one star reviews you have to be a lawyer to make sure that you don't overstep their lines which are many many pages long by the way. It's impossible to leave a bad review without somehow running a foul of their ridiculous list of rules which include things like not complaining about the horrible customer service you get from a particular vendor or the horrible quality of something you get from a vendor none of those things are allowed. You can only say nice things regardless of the number of stars you give. They are a bunch of scum and after spending tens of thousands of dollars on their website they have blocked me for warning people against  Biologically dangerous crap that some of these people sell on these websites disguised as supplements. Amazon would much rather see you die from a bad supplement than let you see a bad review. Since all of their products originated in China I would recommend shopping absolutely anywhere else. Never forget all those babies cheap Chinese capitalists killed by putting melamine in baby formula. They do the same thing with everything else they send us and I have gotten so much crap from Amazon I have to say it is totally not worth spending any money on that website because it is all cheap junk. At least if you go to Walmart you can look at the Chinese junk before you buy it. ,0

"Can't say enough good things about Amazon.  Started out buying books from them years ago.  Now, I look to them FIRST for everything.  I have made innumerable purchases from Amazon and have NEVER had the first problem with any transaction.  They are the best...by far!",2
"I'm absolutely disgusted in the lack of service Amazon provided me when I tried to return a faulty item. I purchased an inflatable bed for my disabled daughter earlier this year, and last week the bed started to blow up in the centre like a balloon. The bed comes with a 2 year Amazon warranty, so didn't expect any issues. I called them over the weekend, and was instructed to email them a picture, to which they didn't even reply. I then decided to call them again today, following on from my email. I explained the situation, going into more details, about how we were involved in a house fire, and was extremely lucky to still be alive, and that the inflatable bed, was a temporary bed for my disabled daughter, due to the house fire, and the main house and contents being destroyed. The annex is only a one bedroom, with one double bed, and the inflatable bed that my daughter uses. I explained that the fault was affecting my daughters sleep, who has already been through so much in the last year, and I would therefore need an urgent replacement. I was then informed, that the bed I purchased wasn't their own stock and therefore, the bed would need to be returned to the supplier, for them to send out a replacement bed. In the meantime, my disabled daughter, will have to sleep on the floor; ""I'm sorry there is nothing our billion pound company can do about this""... To add to my frustration, to replace the bed, it is now 2x the cost of when I purchased the bed in March. How very convenient... There is no wonder this man can afford to travel to space, in his own space rocket, treating loyal customers, like their own life's mean nothing. Bad move Mr Bezos All future business cancelled, and my monthly subscription to Amazon prime. Account closed.  Deal direct from here forth...",0
Hard to find stuff even with their search engine. You ask for a specific description and they serve up everything else as well. Very hard to navigate through hundreds of pages finding that one item you wanted to find with the search key.,1
Account put on hold then locked after making several larger transactions on a different card. They provide a very limited customer support team that is no better than an automated system. They refused to escalate my case even when I provided the importance of having the issue resolved within the next 10 hours.I'm stuck waiting ~24 hours per response with no guarantee of resolutionIt's now been 2 months and they have been unable to resolve the issue.,0
"*DO NOT TRUST AMAZON*Everyone who has EVER purchased anything on Amazon check all of your bank statements very closely. Look for Prime that you have never subscribed to also for Amazon Music. When you place an order with a third party seller, they (Amazon) have a habit of ""accidentally"" signing you up to one of these subscription services and charging to ANY CARD that has been used to buy a product. Even if it is not in the name of the person who holds the Amazon account.Example! My 70 year old mother was being billed for Amazon music, she did not even know about this. It went on for months. Finally yesterday I got to the cause of it and Amazon has agreed to refund ALL 8 wrongfully claimed payments from a pensioner. That amounted to almost £80 STOLEN from a vulnerable person.They also agreed to refund the £9.99 STOLEN from my card. It only came to my attention when I used my mothers Amazon to order an item from a third party seller. When I checked my card. I had been charged £9.99 for Amazon music, as my mother's registered card was lost and had to be cancelled and replaced. So Amazon took the money without authorisation from my account. Just to add. I have now been charged £1 by amazon only a day after this scamming, thieving, fraudulent bunch of vultures ""apologised"" for stealing money. I therefore deleted both my card and my mother's card from amazon. I suggest EVERYONE does the same. If you buy anything on Amazon, DO NOT STORE YOUR CARD!!! Simply input it for each transaction. Your money is NOT SAFE!! Better than that NEVER USE AMAZON. We never will again!!Had this not happened, and I had not been charged my mother would never have known about this and Amazon would have continued pocketing her money. Along with their tax avoidance schemes. So be warned. This company openly admitted to me that the system sometimes ""accidentally"" subscribes when a purchase is made. The person who scripted Amazon's website must be a total amateur if this is what happens. So everyone get checking you statements, if you see one payment to AMAZON MUSIC or AMAZON PRIME, that you have not asked for, go to your bank (or call them) Order statements dating back to when you first started using Amazon. You may find more unauthorised charges. Also if you have elderly parents who use amazon help them check their account. Amazon do not pay tax correctly, why should they also get away with STEALING from vulnerable people.My mother's was almost £80, your refund could be more, It depends how long it has been ongoing. But every penny they have taken without permission will be refunded. And Amazon if you're reading this. ALL CARDS have now been removed from your scummy site and not one more order will be placed using Amazon. Sorry this is a long post but it needed explaining in case amazon are stealing from others. They certainly won't check their end, as long as they get their money coming in. So ensure you all check.I would love to have replies on here of anyone who checks their account and finds they have been unknowingly charged. I know for a fact amazon do it frequently, my bank told me this and even said they refund people OFTEN. So there is a good chance of you being owed and I would love to hear about your situation.Thanks for reading.",0

"My Amazon delivery driver today is an absolute legend! I really wish I knew his name but I'll leave feedback on the app also in the hope he gets recognised. He was holding a parcel behind his back and he asked me if the parcel was for me as it had my name on it. I explained my partner ordered it on the account. He asked if it was a Christmas present for me, to which I said yes. He said it wasn't in additional packaging, so I would see what it is, so he asked how I wanted to receive the package. He very kindly came into my porch to hide the package so my surprise wouldn't be ruined! How thoughtful!! I've never had a delivery driver so thoughtful and kind - how amazing! it must be such a busy/stressful time on 23rd dec and yet he still took the time to help (and waited at the door a long time as it took me ages to find my key). I always get deliveries quickly and efficiently but this was exceptional!! Thank you!!",2

Amazon needs to stop jacking up prices because a 8 dollar thing becomes popular and over night it almost 20 dollars. And forcing customers to purchase a certain amount before taking them to the check out screen. Not cool. You are getting greedy,1
"Item searching is the most important feature of a site and Amazon is pretty mediocre. Sorting by price never works very well, showing items way out of place, or not showing some at all. Sometimes it groups things of multiple prices together. Amazon needs to either have all listings separate, or all grouped under one listing, not randomly broken up.I've only made a handful of purchases over the years. About half the time there are problems. Amazon support is terrible, and every time they've never read what I wrote, giving a hilariously irrelevant reply. They refund things in the end, but it's not worth the hassle.They always try to upsell their Prime support, and keep selecting the wrong shipping address out of the two I ship to. Once when I tried to get a deal they wouldn't honor the price it clearly said on the item page.",1

(rolled eyes)I will always cancel order when they try to charge my debit card a second time. They can very well take the money that was previously put on hold but nope, they want to charge again! So I will always cancel and bring my business elsewhere even if it costs a little more.My recent order was with the same debit card and they did not charge twice. Just once, take the money and delivered the fines. Now why can't they just do that all the time?? Charging twice is off putting and defo made me shop elsewhere every time they try sh_t like that with my debit card. They can go borrow money from the bank if they need floating cash.",1
