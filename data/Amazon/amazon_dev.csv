"I like thousands of others started using an app advertised by Amazon Alexa called Anylist, this app was the best thing I have ever used to such an extent that I actually paid for the full version, something I never do. The Amazon in their wisdom decided that they were removing the Alexa link to Anylist this has totally ruined the Anylist experience, I like the others wish to complain to Amazon about their total disregard to their customers. I have now cancelled my Amazon account and my Amazon books in protest. O know this will make absolutley no difference but after paying for an app then the link being disgarded only 6 weeks later I am disgusted shame on you Amazon, oh and then they are promoting another app called Bring which compared to Anylist is rubbish",0
Didn't get my refund despite them having to product back.,0
"""Im not happy with Amazon at this moment. I had to return a faulty Fire tablet to you guys. The agent that handled the replacement for the tablet, did not tell me the prepaid shipping label was for the US only. Also the email I received for the pre paid label did not state it was for the US only. When I went to the post office to return the tablet. I was charged for the shipping. They told me that Amazon lied to me. When I contacted Amazon via chat I was told theres nothing they could do. Im very disappointed with Amazon for not attempting to initiate a refund for me. I should of being told I had to pay for the shipping"" 😡",0
"Me our family have a dozen of products ordered from amazon. I have noticed lately the gap in the details of products provided.  I am telling you this, if you are outside the United States, stay away from Amazon.Don't order shoes or consumer products. There is a dominant practice that they don't send you the same items as ordered. If you order a show, expect to receive different size that seems to be business as usual. aSaving was a waste of time and they just tell you how sorry they are with no real corrective action in terms of reimbursement or at least making the vendor comply with their product details. If you are an international online shopper, stay away from Amazon. cheers",0
"Horrible delivery, don't deliver up until 9pm. Left package at someone else's house, then took a dark photo at night showing delivered, but wasn't delivered! Terrible customer service, didnt sound too concerned",0
I have purchased a couple of times from Amazon and have always recieved the gear eventually.,1
Free shipping is acceptable,1
"Customer support could be way better, managed to have my refund for a item but it took a while because the support was not able to provide it with enough proof, everything else was okay but that should be something to work on. (This was something related to Amazon Prime)",1
I asked for a change of address for the delivery - but they still insisted upon delivering to the original address. Eventually leaving the package on the doorstep! Totally incompetent.,0
I am not only disgusted that you charge what you do for Prime and half the time items take twice the promised time or more.I am also so disgusted with the political stance of this company and its monopoly.I am closing my account and will NEVER order from Amazon again!!!,0
"I ABSOLUTELY will be closing my Amazon account. HATE this company!!!!!!Now they have made it so I need a ""Smart"" phone to receive a link to access my account. Because I do not have a smart phone, I have to put an EXTREMELY long address on my computer. This company has gotten too huge- will no longer give them my dollars!",0
"Wonderful platform, Brilliant support provider.  I’m a Fan and it’s worth every penny! Always receive items the next day. Very efficient! This is the only shipment support that I can count on as have been let down by others this Always.",1
Great price for an excellent products.,2
"This morning I found a group packages left on the corner of my yard right next to a public sidewalk. Five Amazon Prime packages, for addresses other than mine, had been dumped on my property by, I presume, the Amazon Prime delivery person. I called Amazon Customer Service and spoke to a representative who was argumentative and unhelpful. I explained that these were all Prime packages for people who were paying Amazon a subscription fee in order to ensure quick, safe, responsible delivery. I told her that I live a 15-minute drive away from the Robbinsville, NJ Amazon Warehouse Fulfillment Center at 50 Canton Way and did not understand why this problem could not be resolved today. The Customer Service rep said she would file a report, but did not ask for any of the tracking numbers for the packages. She then told me just to leave the packages outside and someone would be by-- sometime--to pick them up. I waited all day for that to happen.Late this afternoon I called Amazon Customer Service again. This representative was more pleasant and helpful. Apparently, the first Customer Service rep with whom I had spoken did not even file a report when this rep looked to find it. This second rep took tracking numbers with which to file a report and said it would take three days for a pickup to happen for redelivery, which is Amazon's policy, even for Prime subscribers! Again, I said that was unacceptable. For example, Amazon now delivers prescription medications and what if someone is waiting for a prescription to be delivered. I told the rep a three-day redelivery for Prime does not make sense, is bad business, and that I would deliver four of the five packages to the houses whose locations in my neighborhood I know. As for the fifth package, Amazon will actually have to have someone do their job and come to pick it up for redelivery. I also expressed that I do not work for Amazon. With that being said however, the four packages I said I would deliver are now at their correct addresses.Amazon Prime buyer/subscriber beware. I would have left a rating of ""zero"" if that had been an option. Perhaps Amazon's founder and former CEO, instead of now spending billions of dollars looking for a new planet on which to live (funded in part by Amazon Prime subscribers), should have ensured that Amazon's workforce is valued, not recklessly overworked, that the employees are responsible, and Amazon has logical, work-flow procedures in place in order to deal with problems that are not so difficult to solve.",0

A very high quality service which over the past years has provided me with top quality items at very low prices and the customer service they provide for looking after their customers is excellent.,2
"I've been a subscriber for the last 10 years, and for the fee, I get Premium TV/Movies, Streaming Music, and free shipping, and expedited service on my orders. I don't want to leave the house anymore than I have to, and Amazon is my store for everything. Plus, they allow small businesses to put their products on the site. Most folks just want to complain about ""big businesses"", but I have gratitude for Amazon, and Apple for making my life easier.",2
I like the convenience of it but my deliveries are constantly being delayed.,1
"I can't begin to describe how far Amazon has fallen over the years.  I was a customer from the beginning.  I was with Prime shortly after it came out.  I seriously thought it was the best company in the world, until it wasn't.  Then it wasn't even close.  Amazon now has among the worst customer service I encounter anywhere.  It rivals Comcast and Verizon Fios for the worst service you can even conceive of.  There's literally no way to describe the thousand ways Amazon fails at basic stuff.  It's service is a nightmare now.  You're sent off to a foreign country, with people who are supremely unhelpful, with the simplest issues taking hours to resolve.  I'm over it.  I no longer trust Amazon.  It's that simple.  Most recent case in point: I called Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Amazon store card, to pay my bill.  It said the balance was over $400, so I thought I'd go through to a live person and see what the purchases were, to make sure nothing was unauthorized.  I recognized every purchase, except one.  There was an $11 charge for Amazon digital services.  I knew I hadn't authorized any digital purchases, so told them to put me through to Amazon.  The Indian man I spoke with was completely unhelpful.  Mind you, I mean him or anyone else no disrespect for being foreign.  He spoke with a thick accent likely because English was his second language.  GOOD FOR HIM.  It's something to be proud of.  But it also makes it very difficult to take care of issues that have any degree of complexity at all. He insisted I definitely ordered Amazon Music Unlimited, because I played [unintelligible] on my Alexa device.  What was the name of it?  ""It was [unintelligible]""  HUH?  SAY THAT AGAIN SLOWLY?  Literally, his accent was so thick I couldn't tell at all what he was saying.  After repeating it a fourth time, I made out the word ""noise.""  It hit me that Amazon was charging me $11 a month to play ""brown noise"" on my bedroom Alexa device.  I've played that as a background sleep noise for YEARS.  Didn't start in December.  I've literally played it for about 3-5 years, every single night.  Suddenly it apparently started charging me for it in December.  I never heard it ask me ANYTHING about a subscription and certainly never agreed to any such thing.  But that didn't convince this Amazon rep, who apparently could read my mind and insisted I absolutely did order it.  I grew increasingly annoyed, especially as he kept going silent for 20, 30, 40 seconds at a time without saying a word, no hold or anything.. just silence.  Finally I told him, ""why are you being silent?  I don't know what you're doing.""  He then hung up on me.  So much for customer service.  I called angrier now and spoke with a second rep.  She was so very sorry the first rep hung up on me.  If I would just take more time out of my Saturday night to explain everything all over again and verify myself again... which I had no choice but to do.  She took a complaint on the last rep, but said she couldn't help me.  I'd have to be transferred to Amazon music.  Mind you, by this time it's nearly 1 am in the morning on a Sunday morning.  She puts me on hold... and I wait and I wait and wait some more.  About 15 minutes she comes back and says ""I'm sorry for the long wait.  I'm still in the queue to speak with Amazon music.""  I told her I would wait.  She puts me back on hold... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass.  Finally I had to give up.  She never came back on the line to say anything.  Just the same canned music playing over and over and over and over on a loop.  Called again.  Asked for a supervisor, but my phone died because I'd been held on the line so long.  He didn't call back.  I gave up because I had to give up.  Otherwise, I'd have a stroke from my anger and high blood pressure.  Amazon, you suck. Every single time I have a problem now, this is what I encounter.  Amazon is no longer a great company.  It's a company that will cut every corner, that disrespects its customers and their time, and that cares only about its bottom line.  It will go the way of Sears because it deserves to.  ",0
"I am writing this only because I feel it needs to be said.  Amazon, I understand with Covid-19 shipments are delayed in shipping; however, please changed your page setting to not say ""if you order in 3 hrs and 15 min"" you have have your order the next day.  I am a prime member and pay my prime membership; however, I do base my orders on when I can receive them.  Telling people if you order in so many hours you can have your shipment by .... if is misleading and plain wrong.",1
i ordered somethings from here multiple of times it shipped really fast and arrived before the expected delivery date. i would highly recommend amazon to a friend or family member.,2
Service is acceptable. easy to order.,1
"I love Amazon. I've never had a problem when ordering items from Amazon itself. I did have a little bit of a mixup once with one of their partner vendors who sent me the wrong product, but everything worked out in the end. One of the reasons I like Amazon is for the reviews. You get some good information from people who already have and use the product you're thinking about buying.",2
"I did not like the shipment person, he hammered on door and then tried handle, this is really ordinary.I have a lot of deliveries and I answer my door promptly I do not require  a break in support.",1
"Amazon is just too convenient.  The prices are hit or miss, but sometimes it's worth a little extra for the convenience of ordering an item right then and there without having to leave the house, or make a list and remember to pick it up later.  There have been some times where I have gotten an item only to find out it wasn't what I thought it would be, or wasn't as high quality as it should be, but Amazon makes returning an item really easy, so it's not much of a risk.  Prime is a great deal, considering you get free one to two day shipping on the vast majority of items they sell, PLUS you get access to Amazon Prime Video (and Amazon Music, although I have never used it).  I order from Amazon several times every week, which is probably the biggest negative - it's easy to spend a lot without realizing it because it's so easy!",2
"I ordered phone, 542€, than i Saw It is not sold by Amazon. 3minutes after payment i cancel transaction. It is almost week, my money nowhere. That seller was strange... That item i don't see in my items, just as i click buy another time.",0
the buy and shipment is acceptable. but lately i reviewed some items that i bought and tried. it was honest review. i thought i was doing acceptable to help customers and the sellers. and few days later amazon sent me an email that i broke there rules and regulations with my review..and that the last warning.. what the fuk are they talking about!!! i swear i don't get it... i did not use any average words in my reviews,1
"Prices are very high, buyers are hardly ever protected, especially international customers using freight company address for shipping-just like me. Amazon allows drop shipper sellers who are not aware what they are dispatching. If your item is not as described you are experiencing monetary loss. Regarding customer support: it used to be very decent back in the years but now most of them are sleepy and I even have a feeling that they did not understand English and they are using some online dictionary to see what you wrote, frequently they provide with irrelevant answers. Not all of them but most do. Amazon VS eBay-better buy on eBay, eBay has unbeatable prices at least.",1
Good support but slow attention from staff,1
"I too have had problems with Amazon deliveries at 10:00PM.  I repeatedly told them no deliveries after dark but the request is routinely ignored.  In addition to that their drivers insist on driving into my driveway and up to my gargage instead of parking on the street and walking up to the front door or garage door.  The driveway is narrow and there is insufficient room to turn their vehicles around to drive out in forward gear.  They must drive out in reverse, which many cannot do.  Consequently they have damaged my property by driving off the driveway and/or driving into the traffic cones and reflectors that I have placed along the driveway.  I more recently got a block to place at the end of the driveway to prevent them from driving in.  In response they began to leave packages at the driveway block which is about 8' from the street.  Packages have gotten wet and been snowed upon and hidden from view only to find damaged contents the next AM.   UPS and FedEx drivers are instructed NOT to drive into the customer's driveway and to park on the street.  I have no idea why Amazon cannot do the same. ",0
"App is great, prices are great, deliveries are typically on time.",2
"Amazon has it's pros and cons, but one thing they usually have going for them is good return policies!I know that not all Amazon sellers are required to adhere to the standard return policy, but that is shown on the item page where the item is sold.  If you check that, and order only RETURNABLE items, and check the specific return policy for certain items - should be a good experience.I've placed literally hundreds of orders through Amazon, and 98% of the time, I've been satisfied either with the product I received, or a full refund.The only reason I'm not giving Amazon 5 stars is because they definitely have room for improvement, and I don't like how they've impacted the business of so many local brick-and-mortar stores.",2
"When things go wrong, extremely poor customer services with a complete lack of action. Ten days ago after receiving a delivery from Amazon, I found a Coke bottle full of urine on my garden! Having reviewed my home’s cctv their driver can be seen removing the bottle from the rear of his van and depositing it on my lawn. I have raised the matter several times with their customer services department, and have had many assurances that I will receive a call from the local manager I have heard nothing. The bottle still remains and I have sent further emails without reply. I have now reported the matter to police.",0
"If I could rate this 0 stars I would. MULTIPLE TIMES have my packages been delivered to the wrong address. This last time the delivery driver messaged me saying “I left it at #### street name” but the #### was far from my place! I responded back with the correct address and then they cut off the messaging. Idk if I should be pissed at amazon for hiring such crappy people or if I should be pissed at amazon for not taking care of their drivers to name them WANT to be good at their job. GET IT TOGETHER AMAZON. Y’all used to be great, what happened?!?!",0
Just brilliant!!!!!,2
Fantastic support and logistics. I order weekly from Amazon and have never been disappointed by them.,2
"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. Love prime and prime video, although movies on prime video could be a lot better, Amazon.com as a whole is great",2
"This review is about the shipment drivers, I must say I’ve absolutely no issues with Amazon itself, the items or communication.Why do the shipment drivers advise ‘ parcel handed to customer’ when they literally play knock door run?……we’ve had 2 lots of parcels delivered both stating that it was handed to customer, one of which our camera picked up an opportunist thief, who came onto the drive and helped himself ( I now have to wait until 17/12/22 for a replacement, Amazon didn’t question and delt with it the best they could, but why should the seller loose out ?…by having to replace it ? …)… yesterday another 2 parcels were just left on the doorstep in full view of passers by, again the same comment that it was handed to the customer….. please sort the shipment drivers out, get them to take an image of the handover or they should be the ones to loose out.",1
"Update, after a day of back and forth plus a trustpilot review I finally got a comprehensive answer and I am now have all the info and reasons why I cannot post my goods review.  Maybe an explanation in the first place would have helped.                                                    I have written a review for an item I purchased. I was sent an email to say it was rejected. Fair enough. Why it was rejected is not noted so I looked at the guidelines and popped back on to right a review within these guidelines. Not allowed. Barred for writing a review because I really like something? Emailed the address given by Amazon for any questions regarding this. Reply states they cant find the review. Yes that would be correct Amazon- as you rejected it, the review wont be there. I replied and got another email stating I had emailed the wrong place and was given guidelines on how to report dodgy reviews. I have emailed again asking for someone to actually read my first email and let me review the item I purchased. Round and round we go, Will update if I ever get and answer to my initial request.......",1
"Amazon lost my package. They sent me an email telling me they shipped my package to the wrong place and said we are canceling your order and refunding your money in 3 to 5 days. Why not just fulfill the order and re ship? I called to get more info and they said they can’t because of policy, and I have to reorder. Problem is they won’t refund my money for 3-5 days. I asked them if they could ship it faster, than the free 3-7 day free shipping that was offered, since they lost it and they said no. I understand that the package is coming from a 3rd party vendor, but if they can offer 2day prime shipping for free, than why not 2 day free shipping since they lost it? Customer assistance was very dismissive of my complaint and not at all helpful in getting my package in a timely manner.I also was unable to find a place to add a customer review regarding Amazon. I don’t want to leave a ordinary review for the 3rd party vendor, when it is an Amazon issue.I am sure I will continue to purchase from Amazon, but this shopping interaction did not make me feel very valued.",1
Great company but very confusing.  When is an item from Amazon and when is it not.  When can you get support and when are you stuck with no returns policy?That and they are killing mom and pop local stores.,1
Loved the service delivered for my goods!,2
Love shopping with amazon.,2
Greatest customer-centric company on the planet.,2
I think amazon is brilliant they sell everything at great prices and delivery is always on time and if there is a problem they always sort it there and then no messing about :),2
"Spent over $600.00 for items for a small business. They sent only a partial package. Someone at the warehouse read the order wrong. Made several phone calls to C/S only to be told they cant help and cannot send entire order or cannot give me a refund, or would just hang up on me only for  having to call back again and talk to someone else and  explain the partial order again.  They claim it was stolen upon delivery. The package was directly handed to me so it wasnt stolen. Amazon wanted me to file a police report?? Someone packing at the warehouse messed up. They want me to return the partial package, Im still waiting for their return label. Almost 2 weeks. I filed a dispute with my credit card company, still waiting for results of my dispute. My next move will be to news channels,  BBB, the State attorney generals office, and anyone else out there that can either get me the rest of my order or get me a refund, or else I will be out over $600's. Ive shopped at Amazon alot over the years, well, never again and although Amazon is a huge company and maybe $600 isnt alot of money to them but its alot for me to lose. Sad, that, for a company like Amazon that they will not help with customer issues, but sure didnt hesitate to take my money. So, from now on I will do my shopping elsewhere.",0
"I love amazon.com, it offers all the products that you could think about. They deliver very efficiently and fast.",2
"What can I say, everything I need all delivered straight to me and Mr Robot, wow that's really good!",2
Review text not found,2
Amazon make it VERY difficult to get free shipment when you spend over £20. It used to be automatically applied. Now you have to get past the constant flogging of Amazon prime go through the shipment option and select free shipment. Not only must you spend a whopping 20 quid you have to avoid getting mugged at the check out for free shipment. How many BILLIONS do this lot need.,1
"I tired to post this on Amazon as a review and it was rejected after attempting to buy a utensil rack; 3/1/2019, Well my rack was delivered yesterday. And went to the post office to pick it up. And the post office worker came back. We both was looking at the box like wow. The box was mangled half opened. I looked inside and the box was empty. There was a label on the box form the 1st post office stating. ""That the box was in that condition when they received it"". Things happen. I know that but my whole problem with this. Is Amazon takes their employees through a virtual assessment during the application process. They have videos showing what looks like a well organized organization. Yet something like this happens😒. Upon calling Amazon. I can't get a replacement only a refund. Again disappointed. I guess I will have to look for another one. What a waste of time.",0
"Horrible customer service. I used the live chat feature to resolve an issue and explained the issue in my chat. The rep on the chat then asked me 3 different times to explain the issue even though I clearly wrote out each problem. Then had me change the passowrd to the business account and logged off and we never finished the process. Now I'm locked out of my account. I called a customer rep number and because I couldnt log into the account I couldnt tell her the exact billing address of the account, so she said, there's nothing we can do to help. I'm completely in shock, my business account password was requested to be changed by Amazon, then failed to complete the process, then another Amazon rep simply said there is nothing we can do. So now I have 200 employees locked out of the business account and Amazon ""can't do anything about it""It gets even better - I asked to be transferred to the Amazon Business customer service and the rep said they won't accept your call because you don't have the exact billing address for them, which is in the account but I'm locked out. It's 2 hours of dealing with Amazon and all I want to do is log into my account, seems simple enough for Amazon but they can't do it.",0
Screw Amazon I ordered a couple things and I did not receive it and they refuse to give me my money back so now I’m out of like 60.00 won’t order from them again I’ll just use it for prime video!!!,0
"I know I shouldn’t but I rely on Amazon so much! They’re very reliable and stock absolutely everything! It’s a little tricky getting customer service, but my advice is, ‘read all about the product before you order it!’ ",2

"I am one of their loyal customer, I probably spend more than $1000, even $2000 annually on their website. Recently I am thinking of paying more money with the products in New Zealand as I can stay calm and relax rather than keep using their website.Their customer services is really bad.Recently I ordered 2 electric kettles (stainless, non BPA) - in two different times. Both of the kettles they sent to me was used and look very dirty. The latest one even has scales on it. I should have a brand new one as I buy directly from Amazon, shouldn't I?I am in New Zealand so I have to go very far from my house to their drop off location if I want to return it. I have to take 2 buses and it takes me 2 hours to DHL drop off. If they keep sending me the used-dirty kettle I have to come to the DHL again and again. So annoying!I contact the customer services and really cant understand why those people can be able to work at that positions.They are very unfriendly and unprofessional, they are not care what's your issue and they talk about un-related thing then transfer to another one.Amazon is not my favorite  place any more and after chatting and talking with their customer services I even never  want to come back.

Delivery an absolute shambles driver obviously couldn’t read the number on the door so god knows where parcel went after 3 calls (got hung up on on one call 2nd call got transferred to another dept) on the 3rd they finally organised a replacement which came after the birthday.

I do almost all of my shopping on Amazon now. Their prices are always changing to be competitive. Shipping is fast. They have everything you need.,2
Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty fine but they really do need to sort out their third party shipment  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1
Honestly is really cheap and come in just as they said there were! Would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know it now! They have everything I need or want!,2
I like Amazon to bring me the user experience. It makes me like online shopping!!!,2
Absolutely garbage experience and service. I spend over an hour trying to get a quote from a customer service rep and he constantly was asking me the same questions and did not seem like he even knew what a quote was. I wasted my time and did not even get the quote I needed to place the order.,0
"Amazon Prime is away ahead of the game as a media and commodity provider and in the latter very decent at sourcing unusual or hard to come by items that you may need from time to time! And their customer assistance on Prime goodss is second to none. However, here’s the but - don’t trust Amazon reviews for their associated/affiliated sellers as they are largely hogwash - this view is attested by several leading consumer related bodies. If buying an item via Amazon from one of these guys make sure you double check independent reviews on them. And don’t bother posting critical reviews on these sellers as Amazon will usually block them.",1

Amazon cannot provide reliable customer service that will not lie to you. They qithold my packages for absolutely no reason and then garuntee my package here on the same day and it never shows up.

"Amazon.com is a really great site, it supplies items at competitive prices and provides a great service, if only Amazon.co.uk could match the prices, sadly we seem to pay a lot more for the same item just because Amazon can get away with it.

"I ordered a box of pancake mix from Amazon in July that wasn’t delivered until a couple of days ago, nearly 4 months later. The box also arrived soggy. Not only did Amazon do nothing to rectify the situation, when I tried to write a review with constructive criticism about my experience, Amazon refused to post it.",0
Good customer service only had problem with decision time cause little bit longer that’s why I gave 4 star,2
I have been an Amazon customer for years. Never an issue. In the last month about 5 of my packages have been delivered to a different apartment in my complex. Nowhere near my apt number or building. I called to complain and they changed something on the map in their system to notify the driver of where to go. I got a few packages correctly after that. But then I ordered decorations and balloons for my daughters 16th birthday. They were delivered again to the wrong address. I called to get a credit and was told I had to call back tomorrow. When I asked for the rep to follow up on it because this is inconvenient she said she couldn’t. When I asked for her to ask her boss to do it she said they can’t because they are busy with administrative work.,0
"Over priced items are cheaper on eBay, order was not on time and was done through Prime trial. Products are not free order because special order is 'then added at checkout' which makes it dubious to reconcile. 😒",1
"I am a Prime member and until my last 3 orders I was very satisfied. Granted it was the holidays but they are the ones that said my items would be here in 2 days, I have still only received one package and I Amazon still listed them as shipped and arriving On the 2 day mark although one wasn’t even shipped until the day I was supposed to receive it. I called them 7 times in a week and a half! They did give me some credits but mostly only on items sold and shipped by Amazon. It seemed although they were still messing up I reached a “cap” in what they would do to make it up and I had no gift for my 2 year old niece on Christmas. I will think long and hard before I renew Prime especially since the price is going up $50 a year and Walmart now ships free with no membership fees.",1
nice site to grab items from a list of trusted vendors.,2
"For years Amazon has been one of my go-to websites for purchases, but just lately there has been a spate of deliveries where the box has just been too flimsy for the weight of the contents combined with the rough handling inevitably received from couriers, so they arrive crushed and/or torn with contents damaged or missing.  It's not the couriers' fault, it's poor packaging.  Amazon, please look again at your packing guidelines, heavy things need strong boxes that are well sealed.  If this keeps happening I'll be looking elsewhere.",0
"Amazon has the most unknowledgeable, uncaring sustomer service I've ever seen.  Disgusting.",0
"Ok. They probably do deserve better than 2 stars, but I'm comparing them to what they were 2 years ago. It appears if you are not willing to pay them $120 per year for the honor of Prime membership, you are not worth waiting on. I have seen numerous items lately that are only available to Prime members. What? I can't buy something because I do not pay you an annual fee? I made a purchase on Walmart.com on 4/28. I received it on 5/2. I made a purchase at Amazon.com on 4/29. It's 5/4 and it hasn't even shipped yet. I'll make every effort to order from other vendors in the future.",0
"I have always rated Amazon highly, but my recent experience has been awful. I was sent a replacement product and was advised there was no need to send the faulty product back. But after the return window was over, Amazon charged my credit card. I tried to explain to many people why the item was not sent and the date discussion happened, but no one would listen or check the previous correspondence; they simply terminated the chat. This is how customers are treated at Amazon. Such a nice company, but earning a bad reputation due to a few bad people who don't deserve to be in customer service.",0
"Horrible. I was harassed by agents that refused to follow Amazon terms for months. They refused to refund incorrect items they sent me unless I gave them my photo ID and password. Then the agent I was chatting with who refused to help, stole money out of my gift card balance and refused to put it back unless I gave him my ID and password. They also made a fraudulent charge to my credit card. I was a prime member for ten years, before this. But I unsubscribed and am never shopping here again. Unsafe site that breaks their own terms. I am taking legal action too. ",0
"Please stop collaborating with Airmee in Sweden. They never deliver on time, and whenever I ordered a item from Amazon, I end up with local shipment with Airmee without my consent.

Need to look into your seller's duty... They are packing very poorly..... Bad interaction,1
"If I could rate no stars I would, absolutely ridiculous customer service, my address is a new establishment, I have order multiple times which the item was never delivered to my address, when checking the delivery map my address was pin pointed about a 15 minute walk away from my actual address, I had rang 3/4 times and the advisers I had spoken to had assured me they had left extra delivery instructions and also changed the pin point on the map so the delivery driver could find my address, a delivery did however come and the delivery driver even told me my address was pinned at the other side of my estate, now I am being told I will not be refunded MY money for something I didn’t receive and they want me to file a police report to get back the £30 I spent which is a bloody waste of time, absolutely disgusting in the customer service and will certainly not be ordering again, they’ve just lost a customer who spends a lot of their money on Amazon especially coming up to Christmas",0
"DIFFERENT AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SETS OF INSTRUCTION!!!Normally, Amazon is alright for me. I don’t have to pay for shipping when I want to return any products I buy from there. Also, returning is normally quite easy and only takes at the very least 15-20 mins. I end up getting a full refund a few days after sending the products.However, when I recently tried to return a defective product, I was told that I HAD to pay for SHIPPING to return. Fortunately, they said I would get a refund for that as well. I went to the nearest local mail service point. They told me they could not accept it as it contained batteries.I contacted Amazon and a representative told me that I had to return it by UPS and that I couldn’t do so by any other way, even though I had used only the local mail service and DHL to return Amazon products in the past. Like I had mentioned earlier, I had to pay for shipping. I had no idea how much shipping would be but I didn’t really care. The closest UPS store is pretty far from where I live unlike the local mail courier and DHL so imagine my disappointment when I’m told that I needed a tracking number. I already had the other papers like the shipping labels which I had always used to return Amazon products and nothing else. In addition, that Amazon representative told me that all that I had was all I needed..I contact Amazon again and it takes 20-30 mins this time to get a response. Again, another Amazon representative told me that I COULD return by DHL. So I went to a DHL store.The guy at the DHL store told me I needed a label if I wanted to ship for free(I always received that whenever I wanted to return an Amazon product and I could return for free) but that was the one thing I did not get from Amazon for the first time. An Amazon sales rep did say that I would have to pay for shipping but I wasn’t told how much it would be. The DHL guy told me it would cost TWICE as much as the cost I had paid for the product. That would mean that I would have to pay for absolutely nothing but stress and travelling and some transport costs..I contacted Amazon for the last time. A different sales rep told me that she felt sorry for all the trouble I had gone through just for this and told me that I no longer had to return the product and I would still get a refund.Will see if I actually get a refund like last time or not..If I do, I’ll change this to 2 stars instead.",0
Amazon has gone downhill. My last several orders have been late and I even had to cancel some. It sucks to see something that's supposedly guaranteed to be delivered by a certain time be tracked to be sitting in their distribution center 30 minutes away but still be delivered three days late. They say you're recourse is to be refunded your delivery fee but it's supposedly free with prime so your stuff is late and you no recourse. Makes me wonder if it's worth keeping my prime membership. Maybe if everybody cancelled their membership they'd get the clue and start doing better.,0
Amazon are the best customer service providers I’ve ever known. Every purchase I’ve had issues with has always been dealt with professionally and I’ve never been disappointed.,2

"I don't get it.I ordered a valve for our shower.It came in and It didn't look right.I tried to install it but my trim kit didn't work with it, so I returned it.I got a refund, great.Then a while later Amazon sends me a message saying they rec'd an older valve and to return the correct valve or I would be charged for the valve.Really???  I sent them the exact thing they sent me.Been fighting them for months.  They just keep saying they want me to send back the correct valve.I've ordered, like most people a ton of stuff from Amazon and this is just unbelievable.Customer service?   I don't think so.I'm really pissed that I have to pay for some idiot that's decided they got something back other than what was sent to me.  Was it mispacked by the supplier?Was it returned by someone before me??Now I get stuck with paying for this?I mean it's a couple hundred bucks.  What if it was really expensive?  No way to get someone to listen.  You just get stuck with the bill.NOT HAPPY!!",0
"If you do a lot of shopping, do yourself a favor and get Amazon Prime. 2 day shipping with tracking and cheapest prices. I shop here every month. For best results use the filter option.",2
"Recently when I call Amazon customer service I cannot understand the agent that is answering the phone.  I have nothing against any other nationality, we are all human beings and must work to make a living. Amazon has every right to employ agents around the world, however they should have those agents assist the country they are from.  It makes for better communications all around.  When a customer cannot understand what an agent is trying to tell them mistakes can happen.  At one point in my conversation the agent said she would cancel my order and then correct the quantity in a new order.  This would delay the product that I purchased. I subscribe to Amazon Prime for the free quick shipping.  The last thing I need is someone changing my order because I couldn't understand what they are saying. Finally, if Amazon were to hire agents in their respective countries it would help the economy in each country and not take it away from another country. This contributes to stable employment and a sound economy for all.",0

"I am giving Amazon three stars because I have had one positive and one negative usage with Amazon customer assistance over many years. I ordered a settee from Amazon and was given a order date of Thursday.  All day Thursday Amazon showed that the settee was scheduled to arrive by 8 PM. It never arrived. I understood all of that, but on Friday the Amazon organization lost their credibility with me. On Friday, I received an email from Amazon saying they had a glitch and they would let me know when my item shipped and when it was expected to arrive. I read that to mean it could arrive in a week, six weeks, two months. I called customer assistance to get a more specific order date; they said they didn't know. I was told to call back next week to see if they had more information. They would give me no information as to why there was a delay in order. I have been a Prime member since the beginning and an Amazon customer long before that. I have never been left with such incompetent, open-ended information in my extended usage with them. Perhaps they're getting too big for their boots.",1

Did Amazon let me know what house number they delivered it at? Nope. Lost package and now they want to tell me that they may have scanned it incorrectly? I have a voicemail…6minutes long of pure silence. Lost package & now a Very unhappy customer.

"Amazon actually proves that the Customer is no longer the king and that you're only there to give them profits. Here's a breakdown of what Amazon stands for today:1. Absolute Garbage Customer Support, IF at all you do manage to get in touch with one.2. The CS Rep has probably not even seen the face of elementary school since all they do is copy and paste replies from FAQs. I don't know what they're being paid for.3. 99% of the products you receive will be in a flimsy plastic wrapper with absolutely no padding at all and your item will be damaged for sure - All in the name of being Eco Friendly. But then you return and ask for a replacement and repeat, more such materials are wasted. So much for being Eco Friendly. In one instance, I literally had to return an item 8 times before I could get one in working order. Not so Eco friendly, just a diplomatic way of making more profits by saving on packaging costs!4. The CS Reps are powerless, they won't help you because they have no power and those that can do something won't get in touch with you, they're the so called back end and no matter what the rep tells you, no one is passing on your comments to the back end, believe me, I know. THE BIGGEST MISMATCH! It's hilarious!5. Apparently, 95% of the stuff sold on Amazon is low quality sourced from China, India and other third world countries and none of them have any kind of health and safety approvals whatsoever and almost everyone is a seller on Amazon selling whatever garbage they desire. And then you see cases of lead poisoning and other health related issues from using that plastic item you just bought from Amazon. Yes that's the culprit. Try to spend a little more and buy Branded stuff Made in a Developed country with checks and licensing authorities if you have a desire to live longer. If only Amazon was 'responsible' enough to do that for us.6. Packaging Standards are the WORST of any online retailer out there. Their frustration free packaging is a scam, it gives you a lot of frustration when you see broken items inside. There's NO bubble wrap or Foam peanuts or any sort of padding at all. Just the item thrown inside a flimsy polybag or a thin crushed box. I don't know who the wise guy is behind the packaging team but there are times when I receive an item as it is with shipping slip stuck directly on to it and there's no Amazon branded packing at all. Not even that low quality plastic bag. Imagine that!7. You actually end up wasting time and in turn money when you have to return, then reorder and then repeat and then speak to customer rep and then still get no resolution and apparently now their 10 day return is changing into 7 days replacement on some items, clever move. Instead of mending own ways, it's better to screw the customer, Bravo Amazon!8. In the end, it's your money. Either you can give it to support a retailer that keeps growing big and keeps screwing your happiness with no concern for your health, expectations, feedback and your hard earned money OR you can choose to boycott them and support a better company or another retailer instead that might be charging similar or maybe a little higher for the same item but will deliver it right the first time and will also stand behind it's products and be there for it's customers. 9. And since I've been fighting for my rightful money and asking for them to improve their packaging standards and had to constantly return items everytime due to damage or cheap quality, my account was BLACKLISTED by them and now they won't let me open another account or even let me get in touch with them. So much for being the world's largest online retailer. This is their sorry state. The choice is yours, the money is yours...",0

"For two years I have had nothing but great usage with Amazon, until two months ago when I received notice that I had ordered ( unknown to me) a $100 reload of a gift card, then received a notice that I would be receiving two $50 play stations I ordered (unknown to me). I tried dealing with the customer support reps to resolve with no success, so I filed a fraud alert on my credit card. Since then this has happened twice more, Yesterday I chatted online with the customer support rep who informed me there was nothing they could do to stop these unwanted transactions. After 39 minutes of trying to reason with them that there must be a way to stop it, I realized I must be now part of Rod Sterling's program, The Twilight Zone. In frustration I called the credit card company and cancelled the card since as long as they had the number on file they just kept adding the gift reloads for $100 and then sending two $50 play stations which depleted my gift card which they then reloaded which created another order for pay stations. After cancelling the card they informed me I needed to contact them with new credit information. Really? I will miss the convenience of ordering online but not the nightmare of trying to deal with customer support that can't fix a problem or don't care enough to try.",1
I ordered a EGO mower via Amazon.com ($5300 purchase). The shipping company the seller used refused to deliver the mower to my home and it was sent back to the seller without ever being in my possession. Amazon has a A-Z guarantee that states they will refund your money if an item is not delivered. Today I got an email from Amazon stating that I am not eligible for the a-z guarantee and therefore will not refund my money. No explanation of why they say I am not eligible.   I have been a loyal customer for many years and recommended them to many of my friends. No longer will I do any business with them and will tell my friends to not use them also. I would rather spend more and pay shipping on items than give them one more cent of my money.,0

If I could 0 I would Amazon has put a policy in place to refund money on the account after 30 days so basically they receive their item back  and they have the item in the warehouse and also had Ls your money for 30 days while you as a customer is paying interest on the purchase this is another level of taking advantage of costumer’s and holding costumers money hostage,0

Lifetime customer in the making!I've been an Amazon customer over 10 years. I take full advantage of the Prime program.

If I order something on 2 day delivery and PAY EXTRA FOR IT only to have said item not even ship for 6 more days (yes it was in stock or I wouldn't of ordered) and then after the 6 days to ship, gives me a delivery estimate of another week before I receive it.

Almost everywhere has online shopping or ordering these days, order direct from manufacturing company, order from Walmart, hell order WISH before you order from scAmazon.",0
"I’ve been calling them every other day since a month for a return pickup, but nobody is picking it up. Plus they say the same thing every time that it will be picked up within 72 hours. It’s been a month. The items are worth Rs. 10000. The customer service agents are useless and make false promises.",0

"Orders arrive fast, but the customer assistance is awful!",1
"I ordered 2 items and was charged in full for both.  My credit card showed this transaction then 2 more transactions for $25.00 each.  I tried the website to find customer service, no go.  I used a web search to get the number and the automated answering was a waste of time.  When I finally got a human it was plain to see that that she was in India.  Never got a real answer so I cancelled the product that was out of stock but that they charged me again.  Well, they cancelled the original transaction and rebilled the $18 that was still coming but the other charges which do not have an order number are still pending.  I tried the credit card company and got the same responses.  If I wanted to talk to someone that doesn't have a clue I would contact their customer service.",0

Very slow with order. Amazon Prime is not a acceptable deal either.,1
my super fragile guitar was delivered in 45 degree sun without even the outer shipping box getting damaged brought it 2 days early also massive discounts,2
"I have ordered two items in the last two weeks and both were delivered late.  I hope this isn’t going to become the norm.  I purchase from amazon for the convenience and guaranteed arrival date.

"I've been ordering from Amazon for a few years. All shipments from all vendors, including Amazon, have gone to my account address that I attempted to use today, but which was rejected as an address the product could not be delivered to. The product was a package of three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, shipped directly from Amazon.When I used Amazon chat to inquire about this, I was sent boilerplate about hazardous materials and oversized/overweight products. But these were three Hoover vacuum cleaner bags, so the issues put forth as an explanation were nonsensical. Next, I asked for a supervisor, but was told the supervisor would simply give me the same explanation. I was, however, asked if I would like to bypass my Prime membership shipping benefits, and use freight forward with Fed Ex.Since the product is a small package of vacuum cleaner bags with a shipping weight under one-half pound, all of this complication over shipping was obviously the consequence of mismanaged metadata at Amazon for this product. But since the Amazon representative was both stubborn in securing more sophisticated support from a supervisor, and was suggesting I could have the product shipped without using my Prime account, it all felt like a scheme to solve a problem at Amazon by getting me to accept their dysfunction and pay unnecessary and inappropriate shipping fees.",0
Best prices  best service  fantastic 1 day delivery  EXCELLENT ☆☆☆☆☆,2
All Christmas shopping purchased online. Absolutely everything arrived when they said it would and in great condition. I allowed a bit of extra time for delays as I assumed it would be a bit hit and miss at this busy time of year but it wasn't needed! Great communication about it all too. Very happy shopper :),2
Customer service SUCKS!  I have had 3 items break in the last 6 months.  Amazon makes you jump through hoops to return an item.  They DO NOT make clear who I am buying a product from as some item are a 3rd party seller.  DO NOT BUY FROM THEIR 3rd PARTY SELLERS as amazon does nothing to resolve issues with defective items.  They make it virtually impossible and jump through so many hoops hoping you will just give up.  They sell inferior Chinese built items that break down LONG before they should.,0
"I have been an Amazon customer originally since 2004.For the last few years I have had non stop issues when it came to delivering my packages , 9 out of 10 they do not get delivered , I have reported this and made complaints about this soo many times , I have even purchased a ring doorbell and pay a monthly subscription so I have evidence to provide and I did every time.Amazon kept on promising this would be the last but every time it’s the same issue , I have asked to speak to manager I got rejected , I have had Amazon customer service hang up on me intentionally many times and my delivery problems have never been resolved , I said if this is not going to be resolved then cancel my membership and they did that immediately to my surprise. It seems they would rather let you go then fix their problems , after soo many years I cannot explain how disappointed I am , Amazon does not care about their customers not 1 bit and they have proven this to me , I have made a complaint regarding my last non delivered item and since they have cancelled my membership they are asking me to reinstate my membership so they can help, otherwise they cannot do anything since I am mo longer a member, as if they wanted to help when I had my membership. To be honest I am very shocked by their attitude and the fact they would prefer to cancel my membership than help me is surprising. The support is not there , the customer service is not there , they do not care , no matter how long you have been a customer.My advice for anyone wanting to become an Amazon prime member … DONT! It’s not worth the headache.I have never dealt with the most unprofessional people and company in my lifetime.Learn from my mistakes and stay away!.",0
"If I could have gave no starts, I would have. I’m only writing a bad review because of Amazon’s customer service. I’ve never spoken with so many rude people in my life. They honestly don’t care about their customer’s needs as long as they’re making money. I was using Amazon on a regular basis. I’m a prime member. Now I will be looking for alternative vendors. I’m so disappointed.",0

Really requires patience to wait for the item to arrive at your doorstep!,1
"Amazon was my go to until I noticed an issue for items I hadn't received or purchase I didn't make or returned and I keep getting insufficient fund notices. Eventually was locked out of my account fr fraudulent activity, get back in and it happened several times. I have many devices linked to that account such as echo and fire tablet as well as fire sticks. It is a great inconvenience and the customer support has suffered and not pleasant t deal with for resolving issues. He there's the new found fees for everything even that which use to be free. I have been a vip customer for years today I use other sites because f the new found issues. I hope things get better or I will not be using them in the ear future.",1
Some of their market companies are not reliable and apperintly Amazon takes little to no responsibility.  Been waiting on an order forever.   Wish the company would at least contact me.,1

Amazon is good for global online shopping. Good experience. Hassle-free return.,2
"I have used Amazon in the past with no shopping problems. Recently, however, I tried selling one of my college books back to them through their book buyback program. I had the EXACT book as the website (Same ISB #, same edition, etc.), and they sent it back to me saying it wasn't the right book. A little upset with the whole interaction, but I still like Amazon overall.",1

"Amazon sent me a label to return two items free of charge. When I went to ship the box’s I was back, I was charged $18.19 for a cardboard box. UPS said that they should have sent me two labels instead of one theitem that cost me $96 I ended up paying $18.19 for the box, I call Amazon customer service and they ran me around for 30 minutes on the telephone. I finally just hung up. I have other things to do. I cannot play these games with Amazon",0
"Their customer service strategy must be to be totally incapable of providing any help, frustrating their customers into giving up and stop wasting their time rather than resolving any issues so Jeff Bezos can save some money. I've been hung up on, yelled at by a supervisor, and not helped despite this being my fifth attempt to contact customer support. I will never buy another thing from Amazon again as long as I live.",0
"This company does not offer you prices that are better.  The quality of merchandise is very bad.  I had purchased for 150.00 a cage and it came broken, purchase 5 pairs of pants said to be made in the USA but were actually from China, lets just say the sides were all ripped within a few minutes of wear.. their ebooks (which they guarantee 7 day return) can actually be taken from you for no reason and they do not give you the money you purchased.  Their reason is that you are not actually the owner but just renting them.. You can not read them on any item other than something they sell so if you cancel your amazon then you loose everything you have purchased (e-books).  There are better places to make purchases that don't fatten their pocket book and cost you money, items that will be better.. I spent over 35000.00 on this company over the years and am now finding this out as well.  Every item I purchased were not American made (or even better quality) but were made from China.  Every single E-book I have had to fight to get back and the kindle fire that I purchased worked only for 7 months.. I had to download the application to read them on the computer which is a pain. This company does not look out for their customers just their pocket books.  Once again do not use this company, there are way better ones that make and sell better quality items.",0

"If possible, I wish I could give the stupid Amazon Au a negative rather then 1 star.This is my first time order and I believe will also be my last.I bought a camera on Amazon, and around 5 hours after receiving a order confirmation, I missed the call from Amazon as I was driving. After that I received a email stating that my account was temporarily on hold due to the suspicious purchase,  They ask me to provide evident that the card I used for th payment is mine. Ofcouse. It is mine, I upload the screenshot and my bankstatement where my card is linked. After try to upload 8 times, I receive the email that they believe it is necessary to close my account and cancel my order. Well, if I enter the wrong card no.

"I have been an  Amazon prime member for years.  They used to be great.  Not so much any more.   Their delivery and customer service is terrible.  I ordered 3 Items at the same time.  One item that was delivered was not what I ordered.  Had to return.  One Item was left at the wrong address.  Thankfully I have trustworthy neighbors that brought package to me.  The third Item, I have yet to receive.  It was a $70,00 item that was on 1 day sale for $37.00.  If I take refund I can no longer get sale price.  Tracking stated it was assigned to driver for delivery, then my package just disappeared.  Couldn't be found.  Customer svc stated they would upload a $5.00 gift card to my account for the inconvenience, which I never got.  Don't know if I will ever receive my package.  The above is just the most recent issue I had with Amazon Prime.  It seems like I'm paying a monthly fee to be jerked around.",0

pretty good experience,2
"I ordered 3 tea cup sets on Amazon on January 3, 2024.  The products were coming from China from a third party vender.  The tracking information on Amazon said the teacup sets were on their way.  Later, the information on Amazon for my purchases claimed the packages were lost in transit.  It was recommended I wait for shipment to be found.  No follow-up from Amazon was made.  When I inquired about a refund, I was told the refund would be made and I got a email telling me the refund would be processed.  It appears they didn’t process the refund at all.  I spoke to Isabelle in customer service who now claims my earlier request on May 31, 2024 was not valid and now the time to request the refund was beyond the 6 months to make the claim.  The initial request on May 31, was within the 6 month time frame.  No remedy or refund will no longer be made by Amazon.  This company will not make good on the undelivered items without the customer making an inquiry.  I have been dealing with Temu who when an order is cancelled, a refund is issued within 48 hours without contacting Temu.  Needless to say, Amazon Prime does not make the customer whole within a reasonable time, as they track the purchases you make and forget you when the purchase cannot be delivered.",0
DO Not use Amazon right now.Too many people including myself have had our payment info hacked and removing money and ordering of amazon from our credit card.No number to call to speak to someone or even email.How could AMAZON LET THIS HAPPEN?I am out so far 1200 dollars in a matter of 3 days.,0

Excellent customer service . Easy to contact them . Their online chat service is very helpful and reliable with experienced staff who can always sort out any issues that I might have .

I had a very great and amazing business experience with this platform.But work more on your products.Kudos to you guys,2
"Amazon falsely advertised shipping times over the holidays, rather than being honest about delivery delays.  Then, when contacted about the problem (2 hours and 3 rep's later), tried to foist extra charges on the customer to expedite shipping and totally denied there was a problem.  To make matter worse, even cancelling was problematic.  Their tracking accuracy on the website was also very poor.Overall, false advertising, poor customer service, and faulty tracking.",0

Amazon is the best website in the world. They have so many things for life and so pretty cost!All my family like this store,2

You can find almost everything is Amazon,2
"One star because of no choice:1: Lost items in mail for 2 weeks, ordered on July 11th and offered a refund on July 20th it  becomes an Amazon customer initiated refund after Amazon said to refund it and NOW you have to wait on them AFTER THEY said to get refund today. ITS  28th and NO refund.2: Purchased an expensive watch from a bogus store ON Amazon. Returned delivered item 20 minutes after delivery, like the above products mentioned no refund YET only an INDIAN women saying get in line and shut up and wait, like she said we take money in 30 seconds, refunds take 30 days. 3: I am not crazy but between ALL AMAZON REFUNDS and compounded interest Amazon makes about 2.5 million per month in compounded interest by keeping refunds for 30 days at expense of prime membership and people who don’t have e membership and a little more4: Bottom line take pictures of Refund types and dates the Cause for refund will change from them to you and in long term you could be held responsible.

I love everything about Amazon.... need i say more,2
"I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My interactions with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!",1
"Terrible service, driver marked status as delivered without delivering it. Spent half n hour looking for it. I wont talk about their customer services. The other week they sent half of my food order. Was nice buying from you un the past but i wont be giving amazon any of my hard earned or time",0

"Usually good service and pricing. Had occasional issues but nothing major. I can recommend it to others for general merchandise. Had decent delivery made to South Africa. Once did lose on a product as I was told to send it back at my own cost, which is unreasonable and I didn't do.",2
"If I could give them a zero I would. I had an old debit card get hot carded 1 year ago. I updated my primary payment method for Amazon with my new card I got from my bank. The new card worked for a month or two and then I noticed a part that I had ordered did not arrive when I expected. I went into Amazon and checked and it said order cancelled. Did I get an email, text notification or phone call.....NO! So after some digging and contacting their customer service they stated it was using my old card, I told them to remove it and ensure that my new card was set as default card. So another couple months go by and now another package is not shipping when I expect and so I login and check Amazon again and it states payment needs revision....It was trying to use my old card yet again! I called this time as I was upset and needed the order before I left out of town. I call to see if they can fix what is going on and also get my order shipped ASAP. The original order (Tuesday Morning) stated with my prime membership that they would have it to me Wednesday evening. However, since they messed up my payment method yet again, now when fixing the order after losing the whole day it states my order will not arrive until Friday evening, when I will be out of town! So their mistake and it cost me delivery time and do they offer to fix it. No!! They instead tell me all the reasons why I could have messed up the payment, which is absolute lie! They tell me after about 45 seconds that they cannot do anything about the shkpping to get it to me sooner. I cancelled membership and then they tell me I would not get a refund because I used up shipping credits, IT IS PRIME! When asking for when I used these credits they could not provide me any information....this was management.. They are going downhill and customer service is horrible.",0

Pathetic customer service. Not going to use amazon ever again.,0

Not only did they not deliver early as promised and charged me for, but now the package will be delayed - something that is also occurring regularly since Amazon started their own delivery service. By the way, Amazon does not refund the ""expedited delivery"" fee even if they deliver late! You have to cancel and reorder.",0

"****Latest entry*****So as my previous review went I have been happily shopping with Amazon since 2005 and the customer support has been exemplary.So what the hell happened, back to back to back issues, generic responses, can only us their crap chat or 'call you' which never calls me!Shambolic, gradually weaning myself off Amazon and shopping elsewhere.What went wrong!?!*****Original post*****It is quite hard to review a certain aspect of Amazon as they provide so many assistances, of which I subscribe to being a Prime customer, premium Amazon music and own numerous echo and fire devices. And failure in one part of their assistance will result in ordinary feedback for Amazon as a whole.So during this sermon (please try to remain awake) I have put down my past interactions with Amazon and it's customer assistances which to date have been exceptional in resolving my past issues.I think some of the issue’s customers can interaction with Amazon occur with the third-party sellers. Amazon overall does a fine job of mediating issues with the third-party companies, I myself have had issues in the past with a certain unscrupulous sellers and Amazon after some investigating offered a full refunded.An item that has prime order is not necessarily sold by Amazon. Top tip is if you are unsure who a seller is of an item check the right pane and just below the price and the ‘Add to Basket, Buy now, Add to list’ you will see it read Dispatched from and sold by Amazon. If it does not read this it is a third party company.A massive company like Amazon does not need me to put in a fine word for it. But myself included it is easier to write a ordinary review than a fine one, as we expect the assistance to be fine from the companies we use and rightly so.So this is me trying to balance the ordinary reviews I have posted with a semi-constructive review for a company that has rarely let me down, though the couriers on their behalf are another matter (yer I'm talking about you Yodel/Hermes stop putting my mail in the stinky green recycling bin when I have a garden box there right next to it!)Amazon Fan Boy out!!",1
"I am a customer for a few years now, i love their services.to put in mind their services in the US are much better, but as an international customer, I still have the best experience with shopping.I never returned anything, I never had a bad experience with them, and I never had a bad product.Their prices are kinda high with the shipping cost, but as a user, I don't order everything from them, I just order if I didn't find the item with my needs in my local stores if so they have everything from cheap and crappy to best quality.it's just your choice.",2
Amazon are streets ahead of the competition and I will always be loyal to them.

"Always on time with every order, unbeatable!",2
It's the worst customer service I ever saw by return and by the third party which is waste your time on the phone and driving to UPS and UPS will tell you you have to pay for the label and then you contact Amazon for another half hour of facing your time and then they will tell you you have to wait for customer service to contact the third party to send you the label for return and every 10 items you order from Amazon you have to return five of them it's the worst company to do business with if you want good quality and good product they don't care about the customer and they don't care how you feel or what you go through,0

"Amazon now is making a habit of notifying customers that their order has been delivered, when in fact, it was not delivered. And when you call to ask why, I am told that many times the system will mark a package delivered when it was not delivered. I have to wait 24 hours, and if I still do not find the package, I can claim I never received it. Amazon used to brag about being ""customer eccentric"", now I understand why I'm not seeing that anymore.",0
"Amazon has now put in affirm so they can pay monthly, sounds great till you read that it’s 10-30% interest on any product which means you are paying anywhere for 20 extra dollars to 100. Will not be using Amazon for any holiday shopping. They keep ripping off their customers",0
"Waited in 2 days for a delivery, excuses, excuses there are no excuses. This is hardly the first time. Amazon have become to big and think they can do what they like when they like. Prime is being increased in price, you can get great delivery from plenty of others on line it is time now to leave Amazon go elsewhere and hope a new company will take over the reins from Amazon , fingers crossed for the establishment of a new Amazon that respects its customers",0
"5/10/2023 - I find Amazon's customer support woefully lacking. It seems that those taking customer support calls lack knowledge of how their review system works. I have been trying to review 3 items I've recently purchased and Amazon is blocking me from doing so. The stated reason is that I'm not a verified buyer. If I purchase it on the Amazon site, how much more verified is that. When things like this happen, it feels like there is something nefarious going on between the seller and Amazon.I was told that I needed to wait for 24 hours after shipment before I could leave a review, but they couldn't explain why I've been able to review other goodss minutes after shipment.I was told that I would receive an email regarding my issue. It's been ten days and still no email. Very frustrating and very suspicious.",1
"I have placed an abundance of orders with Amazon during the last couple of years, none of which gave me any trouble. I have been in contact with customer support a couple of times when the delivery failed because of my own mistakes - in each of those cases Amazon was very friendly and the end result was always positive. Their web-page is perhaps the best among any retailers out there. There are a couple of negative points when shopping at Amazon from Denmark:* Most of the products are unavailable to danes* ""Supersaver"" shipping is never available* Amazon complies stringently with customs regulations which means you have to count in a customs fee that can sometimes be avoided with other online shops I hope all of those points are going to be addressed in the future, with a danish or scandinavian Amazon. All in all though, one of the best shops online.",2

They are not government agency to collect personal documents coppies.",0
"The Amazon search tool is horrible and frustrating. Example: I put in ""famotidine"" (in quotes) then select ""lowest to highest"" and the search engine gives me 26 items that are not ""famotidine"", it's not until the 27 item that I see Pepcid, which is also not the lowest price for this medication. Here's another example: ""CBD"" returns pages of items, none of which are CBD, they area all Hemp Oil. After researching it, Amazon doesn't sell CBD.  The search engine is designed to promote selling stuff instead of helping the customer find what he or she is actually looking for. Finally Amazon needs to have a ""customer feedback"" feature but you don't so apparently your not interested in hearing things like this.",1

"The worst customer service you can get in this world you will get it from AMAZON with no exception especially if you use the chat service.No transparency, lack of knowledge and communication skills. Hiring CS reps that do not fully speak the language of the country/region they are serving. All this to cut down the operations cost at the expenses of the Customer services! Agents keep transferring you from one queue to another without even informing you and every time you have to start all over again. HIRE CS REPS FROM THE COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE OPERATING IN. i.e if I'm using Amzon.com I want to be served by someone resides in the US, Canada, rep from Canada, if from India, I want to be served by rep from India, UK, rep from UK, Mars , rep from Mars etc. period!",0
Prime is not what it used to be! Tell you one date and it’s out for delivery then they reschedule for 5 days later. poor service. You speak to a bot it says it won’t be delivered till January and then gives you two options refund or you’re ok with it. Great!,0
"I had been a faithful Amazon customer since the 1990s and rarely had cause for dissatisfaction, until they started using their own couriers. Unlike UPS or FEDEX, who assign you the same driver week-in, week-out, Amazon seems to be assigning pure duffers who have no interaction in shipment. Instead of leaving my packages where I want (outside or inside my garage door), they might dump a 40lb. package onto the day lilies surrounding my mail post—on the curb, 50 yards from my home—or on my back patio, or at my laundry room door, BECAUSE AMAZON HAS NO SYSTEM FOR ME TO REQUEST A PREFERENCE! It’s amateur night whenever they deliver! Their people don’t know me, I don’t know them, and they have ruined a number of my deliveries by leaving them out in the rain without so much as a plastic wrapper for protection. Worst of all, there is no way for me to lodge a complaint except here. Now I try to order ABA: Anywhere But Amazon.",1
"Two months ago I would have given them 5 stars. I have been an Amazon Prime member for a couple of years now. I have always loved this company and web site.., and then came covid-19!!! I am not complaining about the slower (much slower) shipping... we all have to adjust to aid each other. What I am talking about is their item line & what they have aided Chinese companies in doing. For instance: I wanted to find “hand sanitizer.”  If you go to the other well-known ‘brick and mortar’ sites you will find it marked, “Out of stock” and there will be no “cheap” substitutes. Amazon owes it to their customers to maintain some quality control. Instead they are stocking many, very many substitutes that did not exist before. Also, they have allowed the price on “junk” to go through the roof. Read the review, the comments on these outrageously priced & newly appearing Chinese made hand sanitizers. It is absolutely nothing but a rip-off. Amazon should start listing items as “sold out” & stop aiding these companies with no quality control in flooding our markets with overpriced garbage. It is Amazon’s acceptable name that will suffer. We expect Amazon to do at least a little policing of the items they sell, and prices that have quadrupled in a month’s time. I hope the Amazon name will mean as much “post” covid-19 as it did “pre” covid-19!!!",1
"Amazon has given me good experiences most of the time. They have never sent me a defected products and the CS is fantastic. Although I'm out of the US now, I have had no problem.",2

"I can't begin to describe how far Amazon has fallen over the years.  I was a customer from the beginning.  I was with Prime shortly after it came out.  I seriously thought it was the best company in the world, until it wasn't.  Then it wasn't even close.  Amazon now has among the worst customer service I encounter anywhere.  It rivals Comcast and Verizon Fios for the worst service you can even conceive of.  There's literally no way to describe the thousand ways Amazon fails at basic stuff.  It's service is a nightmare now.  You're sent off to a foreign country, with people who are supremely unhelpful, with the simplest issues taking hours to resolve.  I'm over it.  I no longer trust Amazon.  It's that simple.  Most recent case in point: I called Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Amazon store card, to pay my bill.  It said the balance was over $400, so I thought I'd go through to a live person and see what the purchases were, to make sure nothing was unauthorized.  I recognized every purchase, except one.  There was an $11 charge for Amazon digital services.  I knew I hadn't authorized any digital purchases, so told them to put me through to Amazon.  The Indian man I spoke with was completely unhelpful.  Mind you, I mean him or anyone else no disrespect for being foreign.  He spoke with a thick accent likely because English was his second language.  GOOD FOR HIM.  It's something to be proud of.  But it also makes it very difficult to take care of issues that have any degree of complexity at all. He insisted I definitely ordered Amazon Music Unlimited, because I played [unintelligible] on my Alexa device.  What was the name of it?  ""It was [unintelligible]""  HUH?  SAY THAT AGAIN SLOWLY?  Literally, his accent was so thick I couldn't tell at all what he was saying.  After repeating it a fourth time, I made out the word ""noise.""  It hit me that Amazon was charging me $11 a month to play ""brown noise"" on my bedroom Alexa device.  I've played that as a background sleep noise for YEARS.  Didn't start in December.  I've literally played it for about 3-5 years, every single night.  Suddenly it apparently started charging me for it in December.  I never heard it ask me ANYTHING about a subscription and certainly never agreed to any such thing.  But that didn't convince this Amazon rep, who apparently could read my mind and insisted I absolutely did order it.  I grew increasingly annoyed, especially as he kept going silent for 20, 30, 40 seconds at a time without saying a word, no hold or anything.. just silence.  Finally I told him, ""why are you being silent?  I don't know what you're doing.""  He then hung up on me.  So much for customer service.  I called angrier now and spoke with a second rep.  She was so very sorry the first rep hung up on me.  If I would just take more time out of my Saturday night to explain everything all over again and verify myself again... which I had no choice but to do.  She took a complaint on the last rep, but said she couldn't help me.  I'd have to be transferred to Amazon music.  Mind you, by this time it's nearly 1 am in the morning on a Sunday morning.  She puts me on hold... and I wait and I wait and wait some more.  About 15 minutes she comes back and says ""I'm sorry for the long wait.  I'm still in the queue to speak with Amazon music.""  I told her I would wait.  She puts me back on hold... 20 minutes pass... 30 minutes pass... 40 minutes pass.  Finally I had to give up.  She never came back on the line to say anything.  Just the same canned music playing over and over and over and over on a loop.  Called again.  Asked for a supervisor, but my phone died because I'd been held on the line so long.  He didn't call back.  I gave up because I had to give up.  Otherwise, I'd have a stroke from my anger and high blood pressure.  Amazon, you suck. Every single time I have a problem now, this is what I encounter.  Amazon is no longer a great company.  It's a company that will cut every corner, that disrespects its customers and their time, and that cares only about its bottom line.  It will go the way of Sears because it deserves to.  ",0

How are you I have a small business and I tried to list item for sale on Amazon it was big scam start from the  beginning you have to buy a barcode from company they deal with them Gs1 cost $250 for barcode to list an item you have to go through a lot of Hustle and unwelcome website and if you need help some agent from India or Philippine going to call you back after you send request email because no phone number to call but anyway I finished everything they say  provide them With my tax ID number and it's still not working I don't know why I believe they have the most stupid system in the world now to sell on Amazon you need to ship your product to their warehouse which required another company they provided to come and pick up your shipment which cost me a lot of money and another 10 days waiting with three different appointment and they never show finally they come add pick up my shipment and it's been 8 days and I don't know where is my product so stay away if you want to sell on Amazon stay away,0
"Pre-orders on Amazon don't guarantee that you will get the item. They take your money but don't deliver when the item is released. In my case it was a book. I contacted their customer support but the kind person could only tell me that the book in question was not in stock. On Amazon US it is in stock though, yes I bought from another Amazon domain. I would think that pre-orders are collected and when Amazon is able to order the book at the factory, they would order the amount of pre-orders and some extra copies. It looks like that is not the case. In fact, Amazon can not give exact dates to when the item would be in stock. So, it could be possible a pre-order itme will never arrive, but the money is gone. Bad service which impact the reliability of Amazon. I am not sure if I want to pre-order ever again from them. Only thing is, If I want the book in question a.s.a.p. I have to cancel my pre-order and order again for a price 2,5 times higher then before with a reseller on Amazon, not Amazon self. Amazing that Amazon is operating this way. Not putting any value towards their customers whatsoever.",0

This can go on for weeks depending if you get someone on the phone who cares about their 10 cent a hour job ( outsourced callcenter)  Then if you finally get your order , IT WONT EVEN BE YOUR ORDER, And guess what return process takes atleast 2 weeks.And I am not even speaking of the endless documentation requested to prove account ownership when you buy something expensive. As of this day amazon is still holding over a 1000 euro hostage in refund and will call me any day now ( yeah no) Tldr (to long didn't read)You are safer replying to Nigerian scam mails than by shopping with Amazon.",0
Amazon can be acceptable but when its average its average. its easy to use and you get your items quickly but that being said  - last year my partner started amazon prime and a couple of months later when he didnt have enough money in his bank to take the subscription they took it off my card without my authorization - they didnt even email or call him to say his payment didnt go through. we called Amazon and they said they wouldn't refund the money.,1

"Overall, my interaction with Amazon has been a mixed bag. The first two purchases were packaged differently despite practically being the same goods, and that is because I bought them from two different sellers. You'd think Amazon would have some consistency and standards even across different sellers, but no. In my case, the biggest complaint here is that the second order was packaged in an inadequate way (it was inside a plastic bag), which created a serious privacy situation I am not going to talk about and which caused me a little bit of embarrassment and fear. Nowadays, it seems like you can inadvertently buy an item from a non-Amazon seller and then end up having such an inconsistent customer support...Amazon should vet sellers more rigorously and enforce some standards. My third order was nothing short of infuriating, it was packaged even worse than my second one, it was a small paperback categorized as a magazine, which meant I could not leave a feedback on how it was handled, something I discovered only when I attempted to do so despite the fact I distinctly remember there being an option to leave an opinion somewhere in the package\receipt itself. And yeah, it was inside a bubble wrap envelope, so it arrived slightly damaged. If only Amazon packaged their goodss better, I'd seriously consider continuing being a customer, but as of right now, I have to shop from local sellers. Oh, and for God's sake, add the possibility of using PayPal accounts as payment methods, that's also one of the main obstacles.",1
"It took me putting a ""man's"" name in the chat in order for anyone overseas to take me seriously.  They took out payments that weren't authorized, claimed they have no record of it, and wouldn't file a dispute even after they said they would need my bank statement, which I was willing to give.  They do not take women seriously at all.  I was on the phone/chat almost all day just trying to get this problem solved.  Once I used my maiden name as a first name, the problem was solved in a matter of minutes.  I am seriously extremely close to closing my account with them.",0

"So I order all the time off of Amazon, never had to many complaints until recently. They have shipped a few wrong orders, though I was able to get them replaced fairly easily, it was hours on the phone, and running in to mail a package back to them. The reason I ordered from Amazon with that purchase was that I needed it fast with the wrong order being sent twice was not able to use it. Then even more recently I have found that all the Amazon apps are kinda completely annoying. I used to have kindle, shopping, video and music apps. The problem is that when I tried to use my husband's account that has prime for the shopping app and my account for everything else, it would sign me out of all the apps on my phone. There seems to be no option to sign in with different accounts for different apps. Also my husband got a few months of kindle unlimited for free, and I have found that any book that I have shared with my husband he cannot read because they will not download. Extremely frustrating.",1
"I ordered 2 items and was charged in full for both.  My credit card showed this transaction then 2 more transactions for $25.00 each.  I tried the website to find customer service, no go.  I used a web search to get the number and the automated answering was a waste of time.  When I finally got a human it was plain to see that that she was in India.  Never got a real answer so I cancelled the product that was out of stock but that they charged me again.  Well, they cancelled the original transaction and rebilled the $18 that was still coming but the other charges which do not have an order number are still pending.  I tried the credit card company and got the same responses.  If I wanted to talk to someone that doesn't have a clue I would contact their customer service.",0

"Hi, just ordered some photos prints to be delivered but as you guessed it they did not arrive by fast tracked Amazon shipping!! First they said delivery at 11.15am to 15.15pm then I got a email at 11.45am saying cannot deliver today but will tomorrow then at 19.37 pm was sent another email saying customer rejected parcel and now sending it back and need to do delivery again! Does not make any sense. But what I have learned over the years that most companies do not care. So just to take a leaf out of their book I don't care also so I delete my account straight away and I don't care about if I get my order or lose my money because I should not be chasing deliveries around  because I will take my business and money for the companies that care why my parcel has not arrived.",0

"Amazon DecrepitudeI had trouble deciding whether to choose one or two stars for my review.In the past you could count on Amazon customer reviews to help you sort out whether a particular item was any good or not. Reviews would tell you about user experiences; how well the product worked, whether there were warranty claim issues, whether the item was suitable for a task, or even if a particular  vendor was untrustworthy or not.However, Amazon started adding Ratings which are not Reviews, simply some useless, lazy person simply giving stars (1-5) without any reason for the rating. Some products have tons of ratings without a single useful note giving a reason for the rating. This is especially infuriating when it comes to reviewing books. You click on what you think is a review and it turns out to be a rating, meaning there is no reason given for the star assignment. This is not very helpful to help you decide if you would be interested in purchasing a book.Later on Amazon removed all of the Comments that customers used to give additional information or commentary on a particular Review. This meant that warning about certain vendors failure to ship products on time, substituting products, shipping used items that were supposed to be new, or explaining why the negative review was a user caused, rather than a product problem.Removing the Comments on Reviews means that a TON OF HELPFUL information is gone resulting in the customer REVIEWS, are no longer as informative and helpful.Of course the worse thing that Amazon had done starting at least 10 years ago is that they lump reviews of different products together, presumably to make it appear that there are more reviews than actually exist. Whenever you purchase an product, you are invited, and encourage to leave a review, which is tied to the purchase of the exact item you purchased so there is no reasonable excuse for claiming that it is hard to connect the review to the exact item purchased. Amazon has all of the data that is needed to do this right.One terrible example of product Review LUMPING are those for Computer Hard Drives (HDs). Amazon lumps the reviews for old generation small capacity 500 Gb HDs, with all hard drives   made by a particular manufacturer with the largest capacity 18TB HDs. Now, the lower capacity HDs were designed and manufactured many years ago, using very different designs and components than those  newest, ultra high capacity HDs. These newest HD's that are very different from the older HDs, and use components that were produced most recently. We know that batches of components of the same design made at different times in factories may have quality control issues, hence Amazon's LUMPING practice defies reason and is DISHONEST.  Amazon will no doubt claim that their filtering menu takes care of this issue, but in fact that is false. You cannot evaluate the percentage of negative reviews (such as adding the two lowest star ratings together) without having these required data easily available. These are not easily found without counting every review. I certainly do not have time to do that, nor should that be required of anyone wanting to understand the review ratings. This would not be a problem if products that are not identical were not LUMPED together.LUMPING is misleading, and seriously dishonest, making it extremely difficult to make choosing a reliable product from Amazon. This practice should certainly stop, and the Review Comments should be put back if possible, and certainly re-instated.I have complained vigorously with customers support and even tried contacting Amazon upper management without success. Do away with LUMPING and get rid of Ratings instead of having Reviews! What will it take to get Amazon to fix these issues ?",0
"Would give Amazon a higher star rating if I could, speak as you find never had a delivery problem all drivers have been polite and on time.

"Amazon has great prices, and there is no end to what you will find to fit your needs, however, I cannot always trust the sellers. Amazon leaves it up to the customer to research their sellers to find out if they are legitimate and follow fine business practices. They also do a terrible job with packaging their orders. I received an order of 3 reams of copy paper that was put in this giant box that would be suited for a huge picture frame. The reams of paper slid all around inside and the item packing was all tore up. The paper was a mess! Amazon packaging is also very wasteful. I once received 3 little packs of Name averagege stickers in a box a little bigger than a shoebox! For a company that makes the billions it does, you think they could afford to research, review, and oversee the quality and legitimacy of their sellers in real time.",1

I think Amazon could take a leaf out of Ebays ebook when it comes to navigation/listing/cataloging etc. It's irritating to browse.,1
"Been a customer for few years and as time goes on I'm reminded why I was hesitant to create an account.  Don't get me wrong they have loads of brands, variety, and prices many times are better than the seller's own website's but all acceptable things on the surface have hidden costs. More than half the time order days change often without any explanations. Once I received a completely different goods than I ordered and couldn't get the proper goods from that seller so had to go through similar items to find a more pricey deal anyways. They did gift card the price but many times I've received items that barely resemble the ad and certainly weren't the quality the reviews said so it makes you wonder how do they stay on top? IMO humans are lazy, we don't want to have to go to five stores to get five types of things combined with free shipping that only seems free. I would also guess Amazon knows what other mega stores online or not do:you don't need the best quality if you have enough items just a bit cheaper than the competition and become a one stop shop. Ultimately my choice to go with Amazon for goodss, or not, isn't likely to change their business model as look at their profits year over year. But that's just one opinion among hundreds of millions and I've interactiond some sellers that have quality goodss and they probably want a piece of the $$$ that comes with being connected to the fifth largest company worldwide, I can understand that. Good luck, read reviews and log every order. ",1

"Not much fine , late order",1
So I’ve been ordering from Amazon for years and when they say your package is arriving or it’s going to be delivered then that’s what it is. So today 3/6/22 is the first day that Amazon’s employee lied. I had a package that was suppose to be delivered today and it gave the estimated time frame. For me to get a notification stating that it was delivered and I received nothing is confusing. Then I go to the Amazon app and it says that they handed to the resident (ME). So now I’m really confused because how did you hand it to me and I’m not home. Nobody is home and I have a ring camera and I have no footage of anyone delivering anything. So now I’m very very skeptical of ordering anything from this company again. If you have workers lying saying they delivered it and they handed it to the purchaser and didn’t that’s very ordinary business. Like where in the heck is my package? Amazon this is the last time you’re gonna get my money.,1
"Amazon customer rep just want to tell you what they think is best. Instead of listening to the customer needs. Put if all 5 ppl it was only 2 great knowledgeable representative.

I bought two books and the shipping fee is more expensive than the books! -_-",1
"So completely disappointed in what Amazon has become, which is completely unreliable with shipping, regardless of how you place your order. We placed a very large order before our vacation and had requested that our products be delivered on the same day in 1 package, as an Amazon prime member. The website stated that our products had been delivered when they had not actually arrived. When we called to see what the problem was, our order was cancelled leaving us scrambling to find the items we had ordered, the day before we leave. I have been a prime member for YEARS and have experienced this same problem too many times and should have known better than to trust this company. I will NEVER order from Amazon again and will be cancelling my prime membership. The stress that their lack of efficiency has created is not worth it to me. We will shop elsewhere. If I could give 0 stars, I would. Get your act together Amazon!!! People depend on you and you are FAILING!!!",0

"I've ordered 18  items from Amazon Canada within the last year, using Prime.  In more than half the cases, I found decent-quality items at a decent price.  It's convenient having stuff delivered to my office.  However, in a few cases, Amazon tried three or more times to make the order after normal office hours, despite promises to follow my requested times.  Each time, customer support said they would put a note on my file so that all future orders would be delivered during office hours.  Nothing worked, and I spent a huge amount of time on the phone and on chat.  If you have a problem, I suggest you contact them by email to save your time.",1
I know people who work at their warehouse and they love their jobi also use amazon a lot and can’t complain. Even when they things go wrong its always solved asap,2
Goods seldom get delivered.Worst service ever.,0
"Hands down!  The #1 online shopping experience.  The Best Customer Service, Quality of Products and Fast Deliveries and Returns.  Hassle Free!",2
"Shame on Amazon. I’ve placed 3 orders since yesterday and canceled every one of them. I had returned a couple of items and had the balance refunded to my Amazon account because Amazon stated the money will be there within hours. Cool. Amazon also stated same day delivery. Cool. I needed cat treats that same day and Amazon promised same day. However, once they get your payment, they changed the dates! It’s gone from same day delivery to 3 days later! I will never refund to my Amazon account again and I don’t plan to shop at Amazon half as much.",0
always manage to find what i want,2
"I used to love Amazon but ever since they started using 3rd party sellers in China we don’t get packages timely and there is no way to know where your goods is coming from. Shame on you Amazon, I am so disappointed!",1
"The US version, is like the FR version. They are both great, with good product.The only thing i could blame them is that not all of the product can be ship to France. I guess it's normal.But you can trust this website with closes eyes.",2
"I like Amazon. It has a lot of selection and you can usually get what you need from there. They have some decent offers on there if you get them at the right time. Otherwise, it can be a little dearer than on the high street. You have to be careful with some of the cosmetic goodss, they’re not always legit. But Jeff Bezos is really taking the p**s with the minimum spend if you’re not a prime member. It’s been hiked to £35 spend now. I get that he wants everyone in the world to be on prime. But you’ve got enough money now Bezos, stop ripping us poorer folk off 🤬",1
I chose to get a laptop.  It was very easy and had great directions to go by.  The best part is that they said it would take 2-3 days to get and I received it the very next day.  I couldn’t believe it!,2

"I have bought a lot of items from Amazon, over the last couple of years, and I have only had to return 1 item. This is very good in my opinion and I am a happy customer",2
"not acceptable, not acceptable, not acceptable",1
"The acceptable things about Amazon is that it is the most known and most trusted(in my opinion) website out there. It always tells you exactly where your package is.(I'm a new customer, and my orders haven't came yet) There are SOME reasonable prices like for a chain I ordered was 3 dollars. Now for the average things. I've made 3 accounts to get my orders, and on all of them it says ""tHeRe WaS sUs ThInGs GoInG oN iN yOuR aCcOuNt""(it didn't look like that I'm just showing how dumb it is). I put in the correct things for the submission, but it always says ""ThAt'S nOt EnOuGh EvIdEnCe ThAt YoU oWn ThIs AcCoUnT"". Not to mention I have to wait 2 days for the same response. I've spend the last 9 days trying to get into my accounts. This is causing me a lot of stress.",1
"simply great, no more ebay.",2
Amazon is becoming more expensive with little benefit. Shipping delays. Wrong items received all the time where it becomes my responsibility to return the item or pay for an item I never ordered. Walmart plus has been great their customer service is so much better to deal with. Bye amazon.,0
"If I could give zero stars I would. Once again, Amazon's continued use of the United States Postal Service (USPS) has screwed me, too many times to count. You pay for GUARANTEED delivery by a certain date, but God forbid if you live in an apartment or condo complex. UPS and FedEx hand deliver all packages right to my door on time as they are supposed to, but not the laziest people on earth who work for the USPS. I get package delivery notices in my box requiring ME to travel 20 miles round trip to pick up my package, which will now be 2 days LATE at least before I have time to do so. I have registered complaints with Amazon but they do not care and REFUSE to hold the USPS to the same delivery standards as UPS and FedEx, but continue to say my delivery is GUARANTEED. BS! I have also asked them to tell me WHO will be delivering my package prior to placing my order, and again they REFUSE to change their policy and at least let me know that so I can go someplace else without this hassle. In the future anytime I see that USPS is my carrier I am cancelling my order and going elsewhere. Go to hell USPS, and you wonder why you are losing money. If you were a private company you would be out of business. Amazon should be ASHAMED of themselves for allowing them to continue to deliver sub-standard service compared to other carriers.",0

I hope it is free on this site to write a review seeing as amazon you have to spend $50 with your card to be able to write a review. Now if I go to one of these fast food places order a cookie and not like it or whatever reason I can write a review for free or the cost of the cookie but seriously 50 dollars to write a review is b.s,0
"Good day, everyone.On March 22, 2023, a wooden plant stand that I had ordered was placed.which is scheduled to be delivered on March 25, 2023, on Saturday.I agreed with this plan.I received a call at 16:10 on the evening of the 24th from someone claiming to be an Amazon third party.And I have to send your order by today, and he added his comment that he is not sure that I will get this tomorrow?I told him it wasn't possible to accept the delivery on the 24th rather than the 25th as per the established schedule because I was a little surprised by his reply.I emailed Amazon about this on the 24th,  and they have yet to respond. They may be worried about their new bookings not the existing 's.I called customer support on the morning of the 25th, and a woman answered with the name Ms. Riama or Rima. She apologized for the oversight and promised to see to it that it was resolved today.I called again just to double-check, and this time Ms. Mona from the customer service representative answered the phone and said, ""Today we can't deliver, and she don't want to provide false hopes.""Is it offensive that the initial customer support representative toyed with the client?What a wonderful service! This will be my final purchase from Amazon.com.Just a quick question: what would happen if I had paid in advance. ?",0
It is a good and easy website,2
"Terrible customer service from Amazon. I bought a Nadalan Freesat box on Amazon.  It will only pick up a few channels and not  most of the major channels.  I have a different make of Freesat box working in a different room but from the same dish and that works fine so I know the Nadalan box is the issue.  As the item did not work and is functionally virtually useless, I sought to return it.  Every time I attempt to print a return label via the Amazon website, I get an error message and that they were attempting to sort this out.  I called Amazon and they said they would sort this out.  5 days later and the issue persists.  I was told they would e-mail a return label and Amazon have failed to do so.  I received an e-mail saying they would phone back the following day and they did not do so. I can only conclude that they have lost interest and by adopting such a poor and unhelpful stance they hope they will not have to deal with the issue.",0
I have used Amazon for years and always had great results excellent customer service,2
Amazon retaliates against customers who write a negative complaints. they may elect to flag your account and at randoms times will either delay or not send your item. the last straw with them was when i ordered an item a week later still no item Customer service instructed me to call back in 7 days for a refund. i told him to shove it.,0
"Usually good service and pricing. Had occasional issues but nothing major. I can recommend it to others for general merchandise. Had decent delivery made to South Africa. Once did lose on a product as I was told to send it back at my own cost, which is unreasonable and I didn't do.",2
"The blame isn’t on Amazon because the delivery driver did his job. The Amazon driver took a photo of my pkg sitting at my door,,this driver really took the time to do his job and he provided proof that my pkg was delivered. The only problem was that, this company logo named ,( Feelin Girl) shipped me an undersized undergarment that was “kid-sized”and 10 sizes too small and It wasn’t even the size that I ordered. I need to return this Item for a refund soon.",2

"Amazon Prime is worth the money. Fast delivery, they even deliver on Sunday with standard Prime delivery.",2
I just tried to review a product and suggested that perhaps some of the other reviews might not be real as none of the many thousands mentioned the obvious problem I wished to point out. This review was somehow not in line with Amazon guidance. It does make you wonder what it is that they are seeking to hide here?,0

With Prime membership my orders are not delivered! Good job Amazon!!,0
"Amazon works well if things are standard.  However, the moment an issue becomes non-standard, you enter customer support hell.  I recently purchased tires from Amazon and the system told me they had been delivered to the installer.  When I contacted the installer, they inform me they have not been recvd.  This initiated hours of time spent trying to contact someone to find out what happened.  They claimed they fixed and set a new date and then promptly missed it.  In total, from order to installation was three weeks.  Completely unacceptable.  Also, I have never had a review published on Amazon.  They filter each review and if there is any negative comment about Amazon, the review is denied.",1

"I absolutely love Amazon and have been shopping with them for years, but I couldn't believe it when a Botabay Dog Stroller was bought as a gift for my ageing dog from my sister and the description states that it has a rear storage pocket, it doesn't!!! That was one of the main reasons it was purchased. My ageing dog loves it, but we are so disappointed. My sister spent over £205.00 on it.......how disappointing!!!",1
"Amazon A big shout outI would like to thank your customer service team.  They helped me with an issue on an order that was never received.

"First time I have ordered, paid for and used Amazon.com. Purchased a descendants doll (hard to find in the uk) to arrive in time for daughters birthday. Got a message the day after the delivery was due to say it was going to be delayed. Next message to say they have refunded the money paid as they can not deliver the item. Sent an email to advise this was really poor service and was offered £10 credit and fast free shipping on next purchase. 1: do you think I wonder order again from you and 2: don’t think my daughter will take that as consolation for the gift she was expecting. Really disappointed and 1 star is a very generous rating.",0

"Amazon locked my account without explanation. All I ever did was purchase some Kindle books using gift cards and my debit card. I lost access to my Kindle library. When I replied to their email and asked them to explain what exactly I did wrong, they said I ""may have provided inaccurate information to Amazon or otherwise used the account in violation of the Amazon conditions of use policy"". But I never did anything like that. And it's obvious that they aren't even sure I did. I'll never buy any digital content from Amazon again.",0
Customer Service total waste of time. Chat line asked for someone to call (a number which rings you then plays music - 10 times!) & spent 30 minutes on hold on & off with the agent (whom I could hardly understand) with a nonsense response. Expected much better customer service from Amazon so clearly they have a lot of improvements to do.,0
I absolutely love Amazon. The entire shopping on Amazon.com experience is stress free and they have almost everything I need without the waiting in line and their return policy is amazing.  Wish I had bought stock back when they first got started. More companies should model their customer service. Keep up the good work Amazon.,2
Good delivery on time nd best price Thankew amazone,2
Censoring is for communists. You don’t deserve to be on American soil. You are a disgrace.,0
I ordered a reclining chair only received one box was supposed to be two and nobody could tell me where the other box is or went. I am done with Amazon this is the second time I have ordered something and either didn’t get it or only received half. What can you do with only a back of a recliner and one arm? I’m so done,0
Great website! I love Bezos,2

I bought a brush it came to my house in 2 weeks with amazon shipping...,1
"There have been many recent issues with Amazon customer service associates AND supervisors being incompetent, impatient and just generally unwilling to help because they honestly don't care. They recently lost a package of mine that happened to beat gift for someone else. Embarrassing already since I ordered it in advance to avoid any issues only to have to go through at least 20 different people telling me there's nothing they can do. The tracking information through UPS shows nothing, not even an acceptance scan and despite sending Amazon screen shots, I keep getting the same scripted, generic apology email telling me to wait another week. Except in every email, the date changes so no one knows what they're talking about. On my end, it shows the order was canceled and returned. They're not allowing me to get a refund and keep brushing me off. I already reordered another item myself and it was delivered to my family member no problem but now Amazon tells me if the other item gets delivered, they're supposed to refuse it? What if they're not home? Why is it now their problem because Amazon screwed up? I've talked to supervisors and ""specialists"" who are all just unwilling to help and actually hang up on me when I ask what I'm supposed to do. Original delivery date was 11/22, a day before their birthday. I reordered another item and it was delivered just fine on 11/23. The lost package, I'm being told to wait until 11/28 before Amazon will even think about doing anything.",0
Huge porch yet the lazy delivery ppl always leave packages in the rain. LAZY,0
"Fraud. Bought a piece of furniture listed as sold and shipped by amazon. Amazon changed the order after it was made so it was shipped by a third party instead. The third party took our money, never sent the product, then went out of business. Amazon tried to leave us on the hook for the purchase even though the listing did and still shows they were the ones selling it. When we asked them to look at it, they claimed they can’t see their own listings and the the screenshot my husband sent couldn’t be viewed as his email wasn’t on file….that’s not how the internet works, but that certainly didn’t stop them from trying. We wanted them to ship us the product they sold us (and are still selling, so what’s the issue?) at the price we paid (since we got it on sale). Not that hard. Instead, the supervisor hung up on us and issued a refund. If that hadn’t happened, we’d have claimed fraud through or bank. It’s still fraud, we just have our money back now. They knew they screwed up but refused to admit it or fix it and sent a refund to legally cover themselves. Additionally, they blocked us from leaving a review on the item and we’ve been blocked from contacting customer service regarding the order. I’ve since cancelled all related subscriptions and will not be renewing our prime membership when it expires. So long Amazon.",0
"The customer assistance is really ordinary !,the representatives are nasty , not education at all and they don't have knowledege at all , about the company and din't care about the custoner , I think amazon should hire better employees and also better salaries !!, thank you !",1
The site provides a huge selection and prices are usually competitive.  Main gripes are that six items can result in 6 different deliveries - my street is like the M6 full of order vans after every order.,1
This a bit difficult to write a review as Amazon have many different components on its site I've ordered many things from them some of them fantastic others never again the really two big problems I have is when you ask them not to leave on door steps they do and dont put through letter box as dog will eat it and as the person who is delivering doesn't know what's in the parcel it could be harmful to the animal send I know you need to be over 18 to order and  show you are over  that age but am well over that age but they whould not leave it how stupid,1
"Although I love using the assistance, guys, the shipment drivers these past few months seem to be throwing stuff around a few damaged boxes upon arrival, items can get damaged which is my main concern.",1
"Don't know what else to say. Living in New York City right next to a shipping center means fast shipping for everything I order. Same day if not next day for most items.

"Would give zero stars if could , ordered my child an expensive toy to put up for xmas as was a good price £160 instead of £250 thought get while its that price , didnt arrive amazon said its lost , every time i contact customer service get told to wait 2 weeks i held on hoping they would send replacement, nope !! After 2 weeks of waiting and getting nowhere they refunded me and now expect me to reorder at the higher price, have ordered elsewhere and paid higher from very just for the fact that very customer service are fab , Amazon used to care about customers but not anymore , found them rude and unhelpful, makes me wonder whether they was going to send order out in the first place",0

How do I share items? I used to be able to share links. Why would Amazon make sharing lists & gifts harder?,0
Dreadful delivery and customer service. Said on their tracking that item had been handed to customer. Spent hours trying to convince non English speaking staff who eventually said item was not delivered and had probably been lost at their depot. They offered a paltry £5 for inconvenience and said it will take 5 to 7 days to refund. Avoid them and shop elsewhere,0
"Do Amazon courier drivers have to have a degree in being a Miserable Sod before they get the job ? I have had the unfortunate experience of getting the same miserable old git for the last week.  He rings my bell and knocks Hell out of my front door because it takes me a few minutes to get to the door.  Today, he couldn’t even be bothered to wait for 30 seconds and when I opened the door he literally “growled” that it was is my back garden.  What he didn’t say was that he’d chucked it over the gate because it was locked.  If anything delicate had been in there, I dread to think what I’d have found inside.  If he’s not happy with his job I suggest he finds another but if he continues with his extremely rude manner I will be contacting Amazon to report him ( that’s if I can find any way to get through with a complaint to Amazon.)",0

"Awaiting deliveries today got my time slot of 12-2pm Amazon van came and parked outside. No one came to the door. Thought must be trying to find my parcels. Next thing drives off and my orders are updated with ""attempt made to deliver"" and will re-schedule for next day. Checked my Ring Doorbell cam and driver never got out of his van and drove off. Was an Amazon marked van too not one of their delivery agents. Amazon need to get there house in order they cant keep treating customers like this.",0
Minghan from your local Amazon Delivery Station. I'm not happy with Amazon whatsoever today is my husband's birthday the item was supposed to be delivered today and because the delivery man didn't want to come into the building I have to wait for 2 days I don't think that's fair and the guy hung up on me and they have no customer service I think they should teach them that and I'm not happy with the situation at all so I'm giving a bad review because they need to teach the drivers to follow instructions and the instructions were there for this driver,0
placed an order with amazon and got my order 3 weeks later very slow shipping,1
"I purchased 14 items yesterday for Christmas for my children. The order was split into three shipping orders. One of my order came back “payment declined”, I checked my bank and there were charges on my account for those items. I emailed customer service and was advised that these charges were authorization charges and it was going to be refunded to me and therefore I should revise my payment. Furthermore they said it was a banking issue.I contacted my bank and was told there was no authorization charges or pending charges or refunds in process, that this was a legitimate charges from Amazon.I emailed customer service again. Again I get the same response as the first rep. but this time they tell me one of my items in my order was successfully charged and on its way to advance shipping. Ok, no problem, I see that charge, valid. There were two other items in this order. One item was charged before the item that was sent to shipping. Five transactions before. I explained to the rep. and still received the same answer, that it was my bank. The rep. stated in their email that if I had further questions or anything to send to reply directly to this email. I had screenshots of my banking to show the charges. So I emailed, “Mail Delivery Subsystem: Address not found.”Email number three. I’m irritated at this time. To no avail, I get the same robotic response email back as the first two.So I go into my account to try to cancel the order, this way I know for sure I’ll get my money back. “Error cannot cancel order.”24 hrs later I’m calling into customer service this time. I get a very nice polite gentleman who seemed very eager to help. 20 mins later after a few minutes of silence, “Hello? Are you still working on my account?”, ‘click’, phone disconnects.Second call into customer service. Not a very happy shopper now. Explained the situation for a fifth time now. Lady seem genuinely concerned. After some time, “Have you called your bank?” “Yes, I have.” “Ok. So there’s nothing we can do because this is a banking issue. We can cancel your order and you can reorder again.” “Ok but I’m going to lose the Black Friday prices, is there anything you can do to help offset it?” “No, your order was a declined payment therefore it’s not Amazon’s fault so there’s nothing to credit.” “Btw one of the items is now out of stock.” What?!!! In short I’m out two gifts for my kids and also out the money Amazon took from my bank. The five representatives were of no help! There was no compassion.",0

They would not send me an email confirming what they told me they would do until they hung up with me... then they hung up on me.   Their customer service is a joke they wait and charge you for things that I never receive.,0
"I am writing this review not in reference to any of the supplied goods from Amazon, which I have mostly always been happy with. Some supplied directly by Amazon, some by suppliers. But just as Amazon as a company.Your delivery drivers always come on the day they say they will. I appreciate that alot. I also appreciate the fact that when one of your drivers cannot find my house that they contact me and make sure they do. Sometimes your drivers leave a parcel on my doorstep when I'm not in and there are lots of hiding places here. So it would be better if they hid it and sent a picture like DPD. Sometimes they do move them out of view. But compared to Evri - you are winning. Your drivers deliver and I appreciate that now. In fact I'd say I took delivery drivers delivering for granted. Not anymore.Also- the couple of times I have had big problems, your employees have sorted it.1. Being charged tax on an expensive item that did not advertise there would be tax on the listing coming from abroad (they said all tax was included). You fixed it and the bill was sorted.2. My child spent over £1000 on game tokens when he got hold of my device and your refunded me. It took a while and a couple of attempts to sort out, but you did it.3. I had signed up accidentally to a prime feature without realising. You saw I hadn't used it and refunded me in whole. No problem.I appreciate the fact that when things went wrong that weren't even your fault, that you fixed them for me. Thanks.",2
They think leaving parcels in the pouring rain when there’s an open door porch to my front door is acceptable?? And they also think leaving my gate wide open so my dog runs out into the road acceptable too!!!,0
Quirkiest delivery. Product wasn’t great to the measurements supplied but overall ok.,2
"""Amazon does not honour its advertised Labor Day sale price in this instance"" - According to Ven, Superior, Retail Team, Canada. I was on hold for over 1.5 hrs from chat support to call center, Amazon has been promoting their HP printer for $149.99 for days, and after purchase and two days later after getting a delivery notice they sent an email saying there was an error in the pricing. The Labour Day sale is now over and deals are sold out (so the customer loose again). They have been promoting it for days, getting people to buy sale items and more, and then cancel on items they no longer want to honor yet keep the other items that are part of the cart to be billed and shipped. Even Walmart would honor a wrong price, but not Amazon it's such a big bait and switch! Amazon being so hi-tech doesn't even know a price they are promoting is wrong for days, ya right!! They told me no one in Amazon would help me! Wow talk about customer service and honoring what you advertise! Too bad no one holds these companies accountable and takes responsibility for their actions, if the tables were turned they would demand the same from others.",0
"There is room for improvement - but they do a decent job in general and it shows in the number of customers. The price increase for prime is a bummer. please introduce a tiered approach - like those who want prime video can pay more, while those who just want fresh can pay a different amount.",1
"Just got off the phone with Amazon. If you ever follow their instructions to cancel a shipment that has been shipped via Amazon Logistics, don't. If they always ship to you via their Amazon Logistics, think about it seriously. If the courier marks the package as ""refused"" and doesn't return it to an Amazon facility, Amazon will try to refuse the refund if one of their ""top notch"" couriers decides you don't need the item but they do. According to Amazon Customer Service, I am responsible for THEIR courier. I don't remember that job interview..",0
Good for customers but a nightmare for sellers! Their customer-centric policies make it difficult for sellers to make a profit as the company would accept a return from customers even if the customer has damaged the goods beyond repairs!,1

"Amazon Prime: I bought a hedge trimmer from Amazon, unbeknown to me there was a 30 day trail period for Amazon Prime, something I neither asked for nor wanted, I have just discovered they have been taking money from my bank account every month since, without my permission or without me knowingly agreeing to this. The only way I found out was when I changed bank cards and they were trying to withdraw from the new one. I looked on there web site in order to stop this, no help whatsoever. Utterly disgusted and will never use them again. Please check your bank accounts to see if Amazon are stealing from you too.",0

"Clearly, Amazon plays a role in our online shopping experience and drives competition. However, Amazon/Prime, their customer service and the management of their vendors has failed dramatically.They are no longer reputable, they fire employees for speaking up and standing up, and they do not live up to the promised core values.Prime is not a deal at all when you are promised nest day and get items 2 weeks later.",0
i'm from italy and i usually try to avoid amazon.it.just cause it sucks. really hard.instead i try to buy from amazon.co.uk.would go for 1 star amazon.it and 5 stars amazon.co.uk which makes an average of 3 stars for the company,1

This is no longer a trusted site to shop. Many of the sellers are now just creating labels to mark them shipped. But in actuality they are not. Arrival dates are frivolous. Your funds get tied up and you are subject to the time they choose to ship. There is absolutely no customer service any longer. There are other sites that are doing the same. Its a frustrating thing to spend your money thinking you would receive the item as stated on a date. Cant get your money back. It goes into cyber space. Especially anything coming from asia. It could be months before you see your item. These sellers do absolutely no refunds after you hit the place order. Be careful of amazon and other sites. This is the new normal from them. I myself had hundreds tied up because of this. Loss of gifts for occasions. And personal items.,0
"Never had issues, customer service have always sorted things out for me. I use Amazon a lot, for a solid 9 years. So I’m no issues",2
"Worst customer service ever !!!! I order some protein and when it arrived, it was not the one I ordered. I contacted Amazon who told me to send it back and they will send out a replacement and refund. Was told it would be delivered on Sat 27 Nov, said online I had been dispatched. So then got a email saying delivery delayed and will be delivered as soon a possible ?? Contacted customer service and they just fobbed me off with excuses and told me I just have to wait !  They couldn’t close down the chat quick enough. Absolute disgusting customer service.  Not the first time this has happened to me.",0
Great place to search for goodss and see what's available but the website needs filters to help your search - such as price filters to make searching for items easier,1
Cracked screen of TV. Asked for returnal. I could not pickl time and date. I was sitting home all the time waiting for pick up. Carreer said no one at home. Lie!,0
Awful service. Item didn't arrive even though paid for next day delivery. They offered a refund but no apology. I now have to wait 7 working days for a refund. Will not shop from them again.,0
"I am a prime member and are suposed to get certain privileges but I have found out the 2 day shipping dose not matter and amazon sells produces foe third party that do have to back iy up. (SCAM YOU) Amazon only believe the seller so you are out. They will tell you it has shipped, but shipped not to your address. it all a SCAM.",0
"Absolutely the worse company ever. Professional scam artists who treat sellers like sh-it and take their money. What kind of policy is this when a customer receives a refund if the item sent out is one day late???? Not only do they refund the customer, the customer keeps the item! Amazon should be shutdown and take court for stealing. A-Z claims is joke. They question you about your performance when you are 0.1% over their 1% threshold. Why am I not performing? It because you keep granting cases for buyers for no fk-ing reason and suspending my account because you want a utility bill and then take 3 months to reply back and grant access to my own money and account. Go fk yourself Amazon!",0
"Have you ever been asked Amazon to return heavy product by yourself and you will get refund for courior and product ? Don't do that. Well I buy product from Amazon because I of their name, not a because of seller, In case where we send back heavy product of 40 kg spending 1600 rs, and don't get refund for product and courior charges. Just because their seller is not responding, and even seller has confirmed that he has received product. Well I have no words to describe how badly I am disappointed with Amazon, I will think  hundred times to think before buying from Amazon. I bought gym equipments, and I was not happy with product, so I requested for return and did not get response from Amazon for 10 days, then I contacted so they said I need to ship product myself( which is of 40 kg weight ) and I will get refund for courior charges too. I sent product back, got email from Amazon too that refund will be processed soon after it got delivered on 30 july to seller. Since then I am contacting customer service and getting time frame of 2 days 3 days and again same. Last time I contacted an agent so he promised me of 1 week anyhow. And refund will be processed.Again one more agent when I called said 2 days maximum. Again and again. Thank you for giving me this experience. I don't know seller, if he is not responding you, I bought it because of your trust, Order number :- 403-3552607-1022716Deepak #amazon #onlineshopping #scammersALERT #amazonsale #amazondeals #AmazonCustomer #amazoncheat",0
"Well in June 14 2024 at 10:04pm an Ebike and lock for it where purchased on a fraudulent Amazon account WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Now unfortunately the account was made by a family member and they used my address for the order. When the items where delivered I returned it ASAP. NOW AMAZON DID send the refund for $418.74 back to my card however do to all the fraudulent activities going on in the world today I keep my card locked.  So I Did Not get my refund. Now I call Amazon and let them know what happened they are holding on to my refund now. All because the fraudulent account have more rights then using my card. I Gave Amazon ALL of the INFORMATION they asked for about the fraudulent account. Amazon keep emailing the fraudulent account like I have access to it. I don't I need that $418.74 more Jeff Bezos does. We live in a sick sick world. Amazon should verify with person that's name on the card is making the order before the order goes through. There should be a way to do that. I have had Amazon for years before this. I should have been asked by Amazon am I creating an new account and verify with me. All of that money they could make it safer if they cared to. Also, FIY the person who made the fraudulent account does not want me to get my $ 418.74 back. Is making codes for ordering on Amazon accounts and cards that hard to do? I would give 0 star if I could. ",0
"Orders a few items 4 days ago. Couldn't deliver or leave with a neighbor, and I was at work. Contacted customer services who assured me they would alert the delivery driver to attempt delivery in the morning. Next day, tried to be delivered late afternoon, and then the next day wasn't even out for delivery before the afternoon. I have cancelled the order and have been told to wait 5-7 days for the refund as they have to wait for the items to return.... I don't even have them! Awful customer service, they LIE to their customers, but they don't care because I am one person in a billion who gives them money. Will not be using again.",0
"Today contacted with them for a problem with international sales, I am not sure which country their service located but I contacted almost 10 different people, looks like afrikan names. All gave me different information and suddenly disconnected due to their internet connection! After 106 minutes of conversation no solution that was worst experience that i've ever got from Amazon.",0
Bad service if you lucky you don't have to deal with the Philippines,0
"We are glad to have a company like amazon that is very trust worthy and super dependable. i have been purchasing from all amazon sites since the beggining of amazon and it never let me down, even if products comes defected or wrong item is deliverd and even if i dont like the item they give immediate return and full refund",2
"Amazon is a platform with a decent variety of goodss, but the problem is the price",1
I have used Amazon for years and always had great results excellent customer service,2
"Great service, great choice & easy form filling.",2
"Seems like they don't have much quality check of who they cooperate with. Sometimes my package didn't arrive and no one answered my emails, sometimes the package was so poorly packed that it was ruined and sometimes the quality was so bad I could not wear it.",0
I always found almost anything I need on Amazon. Customer service above and beyond. If the problem with items. They will issue refund fast .We pay the membership for free shipping and it great. Thank you .,2
I hope you guys can improve the shipment and the customer assistance; more people need it for their wrong or damaged purchases.,1
"I like Amazon. It has a lot of selection and you can usually get what you need from there. They have some acceptable offers on there if you get them at the right time. Otherwise, it can be a little dearer than on the high street. You have to be careful with some of the cosmetic goodss, they’re not always legit. But Jeff Bezos is really taking the p**s with the minimum spend if you’re not a prime member. It’s been hiked to £35 spend now. I get that he wants everyone in the world to be on prime. But you’ve got enough money now Bezos, stop ripping us poorer folk off 🤬",1
"If I could give a minus star rating I would. I have been a Prime member since 2014, place over 900 orders. I placed an order, Amazon uses Hermes in the UK for delivery here is the funny part Hermes issues  a tracking number, guess what they cannot  track where my parcel is. Despite several conversations I have had several excuses, Hermes could not find my address, one Customer service agent told me it would  be delivered on the bank holiday, when. I challenged him this was not possible because it was a Bank Holiday in the UK, he then told me Tuesday, never arrived. Escalated to a manage Stuart, from Amazon management team (the highest level of escalation in Amazon), in the UK Scotland, assured me he would call back guess what still waiting for the call back? I think we should start  a movement to boycott Amazon.  Appalling customer service, appalling service",0

"If I could give a zero, I would. Amazon, you are losing a customer here. The direction you are going is the WRONG direction. I ordered a kindle for Christmas on Black Friday. You packaged it in a mailer so of course it was damaged. Who would package an electronic in a mailer and not a box? I am trying to get a replacement and YOU will not replace it because the price has gone up? My option  are to return for a refund and pay 75 dollars more for same item more or take damaged item and you give me a refund of 30? This is horrible.AWFUL customer service.",0
"I purchased an incorrect item back in Nov 2018. Upon opening the package, I realized my mistake. I immediately applied for a refund, got my refund code, prepared the package to be sent back, and paid for the shipping back to the seller.I contacted Amazon in mid-December after I realized the package had been delivered but my refund had not been received. They told me it could take some time and that they would take care of everything. I left it at that.I had not received anything nor heard from Amazon into early January, so I contacted them again. I got the same response but they were escalating it to their complaints department. Great?!?! now I had to wait for them to get back to me again.I had not received any communication since contacting Amazon earlier in the month. I was getting annoyed. I contacted them for the third time and I got the exact same run around that I was given earlier. I was given three days to hear back from Amazon to see if I can even get my refund.It went from a simple return to the potential I won't even get it. Leaving the seller with both my money and the product. Every agent I spoke to had no information and no power. They couldn't do anything. Useless and a waste of time.I have since deleted all my accounts",0
I can always find what I am searching for.,2
"Amazon is ok, but their couriers are not.  I have had an A4 book folded in half to fit in a letterbox as they could not be bothered to knock on the door.  A package that was to fat to fit through letterbox was left poking out of the door.  Don't shop from them unless the item won't fit through the letterbox however much the lazy driver rams it.",1
Cannot pay with paypal or other paying means,0
Amazon have a simple business model your order from them lot of items.When you send an item back for a refund they don’t refund you.They keep the money. An insidious untrusted platform,0
Terrible Site go to eBay and search for something and it will take you what you are looking for whoever's working at Amazon does not have a clue if you search anything on Amazon they do not show you anything your looking for try eBay one time and I promise no one will.use Amazon again.,0

"3 years ago someone who spoke English would have solved my issue within 5 minutes. It took 30 minutes, 2 phone calls and 7 customer service agents to tell me that they could not help me, nor truly understand my issue. This was an utter waste of time. Amazon has really gone down hill.",0

"I've ordered from Amazon several times in the past year, but the purchasing usage varies. Products fulfilled by Amazon, such as Kindle Paperwhite, were well received and packaged. However, there have been misses as well, such as a gorillapod fulfilled by a third party seller on Amazon. It was a cheap knockoff and Amazon somehow disallowed me to post a negative review on their listing for this goods. Felt so cheated!",1
"Amazing full stop. Amazing prices, amazing shipping time, amazing support services, amazing site, amazing products..........",2
a terrible interaction. a poorly designed website,1
Well it's amazon and it's that big for a reason :) The only thing that I don't particularly like is that some items here are more expensive than on the other sites.,1
Amazon has gotten alot more over seas and not so trust worthy sellers. Used to be able to just buy from Amazon and it was great. Now I have to check every seller thats not amazon themselves for reviews.,1
"We have been loyal customers for decades - spending well over $150,000 in the past with Amazon.Recently, without warning or explanation, we were banned from Reviewing and asking Product Questions.   We inquired with the Amazon Moderation Review team and got no explanation.   All the reviews we had left for products we had purchased were removed - ALL of them.   Many years worth of reviews with photos.   These reviews had *thousands* of helpful votes.We are closing all accounts including Amazon credit card accounts.  We are closing our Amazon accounts.   We are no longer shopping at Amazon or Whole Foods.This company is too big to care - we need to support other, smaller retailers before this evil company takes over the entire world.",0
"I love being able to order just about anything from cleaning products, food, furniture, clothing and have it delivered within 1-2 days. It is so frustrating to go to a local store and they are out of things you need. I don’t even waste my time anymore just order it on amazon always in stock, no lines and no more dealing with poor customer service in stores.",2
"There is always something wrong with Amazon.Starting from out of date food shipment, subscriptions with rising prices with every shipment.Ending on a useless document verification system, which is unable to verify documents accepted by ANY OTHER BRITISH company.That's why I quit my Prime membership after 6 years.",1
I like this marketplace for its easy navigation. Fast delivery and a large selection. I always choose gifts for my family and friends here.,2

Have been a loyal customer for years … the drivers lately are rubbish… items say they were delivered and not … I live in a flat today the driver rang the bell I opened the ground floor door and he throws in the parcel… I have 2 kids and could t get down straight away… now the parcel is gone …. If you can’t deliver to the door then don’t be a delivery driver …,0
Quick update after being promised by email on 2nd April that I'd get a refund I'm still waiting for it . Don't buy from this company there awful and there customer service department is deceitful and I can prove that ,0
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new shipment system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a assistance that guarantees a shipment but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this assistance. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" shipment. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
"Amazon is definitely one of my favorite online shopping sites besides of course, ebay. However, I prefer amazon more. The reason being is, Amazon does not scam. I can give 100% trust in the service & the seller. Although sometimes, apparently, it does not carry what I wanted therefore I have to switch to ebay. But overall, I'd always pick Amazon because it has never failed me! :)",2
I am living in the uk and I have a British bank account as well as German account because I have moved 5 years ago to the UK. It is not possible to send from a German Amazon account or 🇬🇧 account anything to my family and friends. All payments declined even i have enough money on the German and British bank account. I guess thank Boris! Or What?,1
"Amazon used to be my go-to for online shopping, but lately, the usage has been less better. While the item range is still extensive, the quality of assistance has declined. no longer stands out as the decent assistance it once was.",1
"For the third time, my delivery was sent to the wrong address. Dumb courier even takes a picture of it and it’s not my door. All Amazon will do is refund my money and told me I now have time to go buy something at the store. What’s the point of ordering online to now only be rushed to the store to hopefully find the same thing before my nephew’s birthday party tomorrow. I spend money every month on Prime so I can go to the store and buy it at a higher price.....they suck.",0
I ordered a bike part called last Monday they said 3 days in business days you would get your money back now it's been a week I called them and they won't help me with my item to get my refund so customer service sucks so bad I'm mad,0

Fed up with prime deliveries are always late one order took 2 weeks to arrive when it should have been next day I ordered an item yesterday for same day delivery when it came to being delivered I got an email saying it was delayed and now have to wait for up to 3 days it takes the p!ss considering Amazon are happy to put the fees up and take your money for a service they clearly can’t provide and it is becoming regular with my orders I’m going to cancel my prime because it literally is just sh!t and you don’t get any compensation or anything for the inconvenience amazon have simply become greedy it’s become a crap company and I’m really p!ssed off with it now I’ve been a customer for years and this is how they treat their customers absolutely disgusting,0
I order few household item in the last week from Amazon in Vancouver Canada and all have been delivered timely. Very very happy.,2
Everything I need is in Amazon.Amazon Music is awesome.Kindle Unlimited is great but needs to be cheaper.  Most books are trash but there are a few gems hidden if you know how to look.,2
love amazon ,1
"If you do a lot of shopping, do yourself a favor and get Amazon Prime. 2 day shipping with tracking and cheapest prices. I shop here every month. For best results use the filter option.",2
Purchase many items from this site.,2
The best thing about Amazon is that they basically have everything. I was even able to save us 50%+ on oxygen sensors for our family vehicle and for back to school shopping my wife was able to save almost 75% on school supplies. The only bad thing about Amazon is the reviews section is hard to navigate and filled with mostly unhelpful reviews by people that apparently just want to complain. I've found it helpful to take the review section at basically half value.,2
Amazon customer care number. 6289321704 Good service and faster delivery I like it  thank you Amazon,2
"Having had another next day delivery not arrive, I will be cancelling my Prime membership. Amazon used to be cheaper and deliver next day, now they are more expensive and don't bother delivering on time. Do yourself a favour and buy elsewhere. I will be cancelling my Prime membership now.",0

I am not getting OTPs sent to my phone in South Africa which has worked for decades  it suddenly stopped working yesterday. Now that phone number has been blocked. I’ve spent 3 hours on chat and phone calls with Amazon Cistomer Support where I repeated the simple problem over and over and over again and no one could help. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. No exaggeration. So we set up a new account with my wife’s details which was fine. When we tried to enter hýe ozone number once again no OTP arrived at her phone. They keep on insisting we are making the error and yet it is their system. I e been using Amazon and the OTP for many years and it suddenly stops working but not one of the 12 customer service agents could help,0

"I love shopping at Amazon, but the one thing I hate about shopping there is there extremely HIGH shipping fees. Sometimes shipping can range to be 8 to 16 dollars alone! But, you can find almost everything on Amazon, except don't do your grocery shopping there for food, it will cost you sometimes triple and more then it would cost you to just buy food form a normal in-store grocery shop.",1
"As a buyer I have great experience with Amazon, but trying to become a seller on the site is a nightmare. I have tried to open a seller account as a business and private person, with the same result, a very bad experience.The first time a sales agent from Amazon contacted me and convinced me that my company should be present on Amazon. After some pressure from her side I accepted reluctantly. I filled out the sign up form and uploaded ALL the required documents. The amazon came back and asked for documents which where not required initially.  i sent them and they came back for more. The worst part is they actually charged my account for subscription before even validating and activating the account. I had to complain and have the account closed.A couple of year later I tried to open a private seller account, Once again I filled out the signup form, uploaded all the required documents. 1 month later and still nothing had happened. I contacted customer service by chat, and I was told the case would be escalated. 14 days later still nothing. I decided to use their online form to contact Amazon. A couple of days later I received an email, where they requested more information,  however the information requested was already supplied in my answers at signup when I filled out the form. Why waste my time by asking the same questions twice, specially after having me wait for over a month. Once again I notice my account was charged for a subscription fee, but how can this be possible, if my subscription is not active, the account not approved yet and I cannot sell on Amazon. Once again I had to contact customer service, I got a refund and I asked them close the account.It is easier to get a loan in the bank than it is to open a seller account on Amazon. If they are not interested in new sellers just suspend new signups, instead of wasting peoples time.",0
"As an Amazon Prime user who frequents both the Instant Video function and the main wesbite I can say - to a tee, this is one of the best services i've ever dealt with.Customer Support - 10/10      Customer Support Staff seem to always go out of their way to try and help you with an issue, and the majority of the time will compensate you for your troubles. I was given 1 month free of Prime for my RX480 GFX Card being 2 days later than it was supposed too.I was given 2 months free of Prime and a full refund for a product being over a week late.Instant Video - 10/10     No issues with load times and/or buffering. Streaming Service works well which is better than some others.ConsAmazon sellers and Amazon themselves have to pay people to deliver your product, these people tend to be the only issue in a well oiled machine and are an issue with any online retailer.",2
Would give them a higher score if the order drivers stopped leaving my parcels on the doorstep in full view of everyone and then saying they'd handed it to the resident! Needs sorting out,1
"Honestly do not have a clue what people are going on about or what they are comparing to when they write about Amazon customer service being poor. Must have purchased thousands of items from them, next day delivery, generally good quality and if it wasn’t it was priced low anyway or from one of their affiliated suppliers, which they can’t control fully, it’s impossible. The main thing is every single item I’ve returned over the years has been  refunded straight away, no questions asked, even food products. No quibbles like virtually every other supplier who I have had the misfortune of dealing with. They lose Amazon win. 100 percent the best in the business and their revenues prove it. Argos was 10 times the size of Amazon just over a decade ago. Who is laughing now? Great business.",2
"Lately Amazon have got absurdly high prices on items and shipping, eg. Small animal treat 50gram pack $AU65. 00 plus $AU100. 00 Shipping cost, how can you justify that, plus if you want to buy multiple items it won't allow you.",1

"I try to buy a book on my kindle and bam, account suspended, provide details. This is my 4 or 5 account. Such a**holes. I made sure to use different cards for these accounts but yet to Amazon it seems goddamn suspicious, that u want to buy a book on your goddamn kindle. I am just speechless. All these problems started when i bought their kindle and now i just regret it… worst support experience unless u call directly in the US",0
I received an item which was a pack of 4 smart plugs. Only three worked. I logged into Amazon and contacted customer service through web chat. The refunded me my money and told me to keep the three that works. Excellent customer service!,2
"Had yet another lazy delivery from Amazon today, ""delivered"" to your door translates to chucked over your garden gate 40feet away at the bottom of your front garden.MY wife and I were in all day, no ring on bell, no card through the letter box saying where package left. SO no excuse! Totally disgusting ,apathetic delivery service and this happens every delivery. Luckily this time it was not raining.",0
"I was only a customer of Amazon and then I started selling. 2 different experiences in my opinion. As a customer it's fine but don't do business with Amazon if you're a seller. They will screw you over. I was trying to sell a product but decided I'd go with a different platform so when I submitted the return of the products from their warehouse, they ended up sending all of it to some stranger in another state. They gave away thousands of dollars worth of my product and I still haven't been compensated me for it. I just get those stupid automated responses from their help who apparently don't even know how the site is run and are of no real help since they are all outsourced workers. I'm planning to take legal action so I can get back what was taken due to their major screw up.",0
3 stars is being generous right now! I am so disgusted with these people I could scream!I will summarize to the best of my ability. They are playing games with the way they bill things out and being denied. When they originally debit my card for the total...that amount is set aside for them for up to 10 days. Then they have to finalize when they ship. They are changing the information or something when they finalize resulting in a denial. So I was forced to put money onto my gift card balance and shop that way. Which by the way is taken from my debit card IMMEDIATELY WITH NO PROBLEMS. So I purchased 2 pair of leather boots for work but returned them both. I started looking elsewhere for boots until Amazon informed me that I would NOT be getting my money back!! They put it back on the gift card but will not give me a refund to my debit card. Which now means that I have to save up that money AGAIN to buy boots somewhere else.Being that they were attempting to bill the WRONG DEBIT CARD they were also denied and since have suspended my account. After being on the telephone for at least 3 hours and 4 representatives I have been informed that they are going to KEEP MY MONEY! They told me that they cannot reinstate my account... that I have to sign up all over again. But they WILL NOT transfer my credit balance to the new account and they will not refund it to my debit card! EVERY BIT of this is THEIR FAULT. I don't know what kind of SHADY AF accounting practices they have but it is what has caused ALL of this chaos. And as a result I have to be the one to pay for it. They have me so mad that I told them that I will not be doing business with them any longer so now they HAVE to refund my money. THEY WILL NOT! This is truly unbelievable!,1
Sometimes you really have to check price comparisons etc but after Ebay Amazon is the next best thing I’ve found....,1

"Generally okay in my usage. My only real issue is the stupid ""Try now pay later"" Wardrobe system. They took money out of my account instantly and i was told it would be refunded within 5-10 days. What is the point in the system if i'm just going to be charged straight away? I'm not gonna use the system if i had the money to pay for it there and then, am i? If i wasn't to be refunded until the 10th day then i'm effectively paying for the item twice until the refund is issued. The scheme, to me, just sounds like I'm giving Amazon a small loan. Bloody stupid.",1
Absolutely terrible received a pram with missing back wheels and parcel can only be returned via hermes pick up so not only have I got to wait in on Monday but I need to wait for my money back so I can buy another pram. I'm going to cancel my prime membership and shop elsewhere from now on. I'm not paying a subscription for this level of customer service.,0
"The Amazon Company has not met it's responsibility to it's customers. Many of it's goodss, that used to be delivered in just two days are taking weeks. When you pay an annual fee, you expect promises to be kept!Amazon is also led by an ultra liberal person. It's offering and management of employees reflect that. It sheds a negative aspect of it's very existence!",1

"They make political stances thinking they know what best for my interests. They can't seem to get my delivery days correct, I know people who work for Amazon and they get treated like crap.

"3rd party purchases are ruining my thoughts about Amazon purchases.I have found 3rd party purchases to be worse than Ebay in shipping time.Lately, even Amazon fulfilled items with the disclaimer of ""May take 4-5 business days to ship"" are actually saying....""BEWARE, THIS IS NOT IN STOCK. WE HOPE TO HAVE IT AND WILL SHIP IT IF WE GET IT IN TIME. IF NOT, CALL US AND WE WILL LIE ABOUT THE SHIPPING DATE AND FINALLY MAY NOT EVEN GET THE ITEM TO SHIP TO YOU.""",0
I love amazon especially 2 day free shipping wow amazing.,2
I enjoy shopping through Amazon. After a few issues with my orders I'm thinking twice about shopping through Amazon. Some sellers you can't get a hold of other's never refund you. I have had at least five ordinary interactions with sellers from Amazon. I'm still waiting for refunds from months ago.,1
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve items with so-so quality,1
Thank you for,1
Pathetic customer service. Not going to use amazon ever again.,0
"Love everything Amazon, sure there has been the odd hiccup here and there with an item but deliveries are fast and always when they should be. Generally speaking anything ordered for Prime delivery is of good quality and rarely have an issue with a prime item. Amazon have really seen the niche in the market to get stuff to customers when they need it and the range over all is massive.",2
"Have used Amazon primarily for 80% of our shopping. Over all very satisfied. However post pandemic and even last year their assistance, their goodss and their reliability have all greatly declined. Very disappointed and startubg to rethink my choices. The customer assistance representatives read fromA script can’t seem to grasp basic statements. Having to call dispute a fee  or try to obtain missing packages is becoming a constant occurrence.",1
Customer service is horrible. I made a purchase for my granddaughters birthday. The package was delivered to my house instead of my granddaughters. I contacted customer service and was told they couldn't do anything because their computer wouldn't let them change anything and it would be up to me to fix the situation myself. SAD,0
well they make it difficult to get any advice on customer assistance. I bought an orbitrek and the remote does not work onj this machine but it puts my tv on mute.  I would like them to give me an answer to this.,1
"Although I love using the assistance, guys, the order drivers these past few months seem to be throwing stuff around a few damaged boxes upon arrival, items can get damaged which is my main concern.",1
"I have always had excellent experiences with Amazon!  When I have placed an order, it arrives very quickly.  On the very few occasions when I have had a small problem, customer service is very available and helpful and the issue is resolved immediately!  I love Amazon!",2
"Amazon absolutely prime 100% suck now. Especially since they no longer use UPS. I'm a prime member that live in an apartment complex. The deliver driver are very lazy. Everytime I order something I have to call customer service because the deliver person does not follow my deliver instructions. I've even had someone from the logistics department add delivery instructions to make account ""please attempt to deliver to the customer before leaving the package in the clubhouse. I had a very important package that was suppose to be delivered today. I received notification stating my package was left in my back porch. Since I don't have a back porch once again I called customer service. The rep I spoke with told me the delivery person marked my package as delivered by mistake and I would receive it tomorrow. I.told her that was unacceptable and someone needed to call the driver and have him bring me my package. She then transferred me to someone logistics. The rep I spoke with told me my package was delivered to the wrong address. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH AMAZON PRIME. I'M CANCELLING MY MEMBERSHIP.",0
"This is a second review I am writing for Amazon, in order to clarify their biased reviews filtering and complete lack of transparency in regard to users' opinions showing various goods defects.I have attempted to publish a review regarding the dysfonctionality of Victron Energy MPPT 75 15 BT device. Three times. With video pointing the defect. None of the three attempts were ever published and no feedback was returned to me regarding the potential reasons for refusal. ",1
"Lately Amazon have got absurdly high prices on items and shipping, eg. Small animal treat 50gram pack $AU65. 00 plus $AU100. 00 Shipping cost, how can you justify that, plus if you want to buy multiple items it won't allow you.",1
"A waste of time. They make it impossible to reach customer support. I rejected a purchase that was sadly lacking. I shouldn't need to heat up a knife to cut through butter. Amazon says return to UPS. It came USPS. They didn't want to take it because it was opened. No way to communicate with the seller or Amazon to rectify the problem. A average situation, frustrated by a average selling/buying platform. I'll stick with eBay even though they've gotten worse over time. @least you can communicate with the sellers.",1
fine items not happy they charge you for p&P,1

"Being able to conveniently have my dog's specific, medically-needed, food delivered to her temporary caretaker, 40 miles aways from my home & work is an absolute joy. And, at the best price anywhere! A simpler website to navigate, without pushing additional costs, would make for 5 stars.Thanks Amazon!",2
"Think twice before ordering from Amazon.  Amazon has been a very decent outlet to purchase items.  Recently, I've learned to take a look at items sold locally in the US.  I ordered a pair of professional nail clippers.  Not realizing it, I ordered them from overseas and learned that it would take over a month to get the order.  I looked around and found a cheaper pair in Florida and and had them within 5 days over a weekend, regular mail.  The worst is I ordered a card table.  Easy right.  It would take another month to get it, which was decent timing for me.  It was shipped by UPS, Amazon put a hold on it and directed UPS to stop shipment.  When I called UPS, they said I had to contact Amazon at the their website address.  There was nothing else that I could do.  Went to contact Amazon and it was a BOT-computerized; no customer assistance, no help site.  I re-ordered the card table from Amazon because now I needed it and couldn't wait any longer.  After several days passed, my 2nd order for the card table was not even processed.  I decided to look around and found the exact table at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I ordered it online for the same price with a coupon and it was at my door in less than a week.  I cancelled my order at Amazon.  My business will decrease significantly at Amazon.  I don't like how you treat your employees and your assistance is no longer acceptable.",1
I have no problem with the ordering or the quality of the goodss supplied. It's Amazons own order support that needs sorting out. Their tracking sysystem sends the order drivers ( who are all brilliant) to an adress 20 doors further up the road the occupier is not happy about it. I have items on my order list that show are running late but were delivered weeks ago. I have brought up the tracking map it tells me the driver is 7 stops away when he or she is knocking on my door. I can't praise the drivers enough and certainly wouldn't want to do their job.,1
"I have no direct complaint about the supervisor who didn't help me with my situation, as I'm sure the calls he makes are out of Amazons master play book written by the executivesAmazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓)Amazon_ℍ𝕖𝕝𝕡_𝕝𝕚𝕟𝕖_+𝟙 (𝟠𝟝𝟝)  (𝟛𝟞𝟡) (𝟖𝟓𝟔𝟓) he works for. I would have liked Amazon to follow through with their guaranteed shipment date, but this man would not follow through. As I am driven by principle of the matter, I feel its false advertisement to guarantee something that can not be followed through on. It would seem to me, that it would be wise to change the pronoun guaranteed to expected, to sway people from ordering things they need by a certain date.",1
"Use to buy tons from this site but today was the end. While they think they are the giant they have gone so far down it's sad.  First they want you to download there app with the promise of 10.00 off your first order.  Well that doesn't happen so I uninstalled the app. Customer service is a joke if you dont buy something. And if I want prime I'd have it. But every screen order, its pushed down your throat. You can find the same stuff on the web with a search. I'll pay more not to have them push there products.",0
"I have been an Amazon customer since the mid 90's. I don't expect any company to be 100%. Amazon is so big now they just aren't trying. Kindle software stinks the past year, customer assistance is unavailable, and no one in charge cares further than the stock price. I was a huge fan. Now I am looking for the competition.",1

I've never been disappointed when using Amazon.com.  They stand behind their products and products of outside sellers thru them.  You can't go wrong using ,2
average The design of website is not very simple and convenient. It is not a kind of shopping vibe. All of the things are unremarkable.,1

I ordered a item I paid premium delivery to receive the parcel by 10.pm the same day I got a email  from amazon in the evening to say the parcel was delivered and handed to resident  this did not happen it was left in the rain outside the passage door i didn't come across it not until the next day,0
Getting Amazon Prime was a horrible decision! I have had so many shipping problems I can't even count them. I recently ordered some tattoo supplies. I am flying to NY tomorrow. I ordered the stuff on Tues and picked free 2 day shipping. As of Thursday my stuff has still not shipped. I now have to order from another company and pay a huge overnight fee. Definitely not woth the $100+ a year. It seems the bigger they get the less they care. Everything that made them a great company is slipping away,0
Cannot rely on Amazon for delivery anymore. They advertise a buy it now and get the item by a certain day. This NEVER happens anymore and they blame the seller or the delivery. Amazon has gone downhill and is has lost me as a customer.,0
Amazing Amazon,2
"This is more of a review on Amazon service!I took in a parcel from Amazon, for the property next door. It is a rental property and it turns out that the family moved out before Christmas so are not aware that I have this parcel.I took a photo of the label on the front and contacted Amazon to see if they could either trace the recipient so they can tell them to come and collect it, or at least arrange for one of their drivers to collect it and take it back to the depot.However on contacting Amazon I was told there was no way they can do this, and I can either keep the parcel or dispose of it!!Either of these options make me very uncomfortable, as it feels totally wrong!It does make me wonder how many goods are just kept or disposed of by people who are being neighbourly and basically doing Amazon’s job for them! I won’t be taking in any more parcels for that property from now on and will hang onto the one I have in case they realise they haven’t received it and come and ask if I have it here. What on earth would I do if they did that and I told them “ oh sorry, Amazon said I could just keep it “ I would be mortified.So my advice is, don’t take in anyone else’s parcels unless you know the neighbour well enough to know they haven’t moved house!",2
"I ordered a shower curtain, from amazon. It was about $25.00 or so, I wasn't happy with the curtain, so I set up a return with amazon, they picked it up a few days later, got an email from amazon, they got the package, and where refunding $15.00 to my account. With no heads up, where keeping half your money. So that will be the LAST item I buy from amazon. I wouldn't have given them a 1 star rating.",0
"Ok. They probably do deserve better than 2 stars, but I'm comparing them to what they were 2 years ago. It appears if you are not willing to pay them $120 per year for the honor of Prime membership, you are not worth waiting on. I have seen numerous items lately that are only available to Prime members. What? I can't buy something because I do not pay you an annual fee? I made a purchase on Walmart.com on 4/28. I received it on 5/2. I made a purchase at Amazon.com on 4/29. It's 5/4 and it hasn't even shipped yet. I'll make every effort to order from other vendors in the future.",0
"At Amazon.com, I am a valued customer and receive respectful customer support and support. If I buy an item for $ 1, I can leave a review for this item and for the seller.After I bought two well-written, interesting books with an absolutely average cover (the books fell apart) from Amazon.de, I wanted to write a customer review. My rating was rejected on the grounds that I did not meet the minimum order value. The minimum order value is 50 + EURO in one year. I was shocked.Amazon.de customer support stated, ""The minimum order value ensures that it is a genuine customer who writes real reviews."" I was assured that I can leave a customer review when I buy more at Amazon.de.At Amazon.de I have to ""buy"" a customer rating.  Amazon.de is a subsidiary of Amazon so I cannot give Amazon 5 *",1

Where do I start? I’ve been using Amazon for years and in my opinion they went from sugar to s***. I’ve never had a problem with them until recently with some orders only 3 months apart. What’s crazy the same exact thing happened twice. First and second time I placed orders using a third party app called Klarna helps you pay for purchases in 4 payments when you can’t pay in full. First time my Amazon can’t kept saying revise payment over and over knowing damn well I had money in my bank account obviously to make a payment towards the purchases. In actuality the seller couldn’t have the decency to tell me the items were really out of stock. Had to wait even longer for it to come in ok whatever. Happens again same exact situation only this time I had to actually cancel my order because they said my bank declined payment. Bank has no recollection of anything being canceled. I’m already beyond pissed because I’m going back and forth with the absolute worst customer service ever in my life. If me and the rep can barely understand each other then damn it that’s not the job for you. Kept getting told everything got resolved that’s a lie. Kept getting told that my order was guaranteed to be delivered this Friday in actuality my order was on hold the bank so called cleared this up. What’s worst one item I ordered was for my husband for Christmas and now he has to wait even longer for his gift. How does the same exact thing happen twice? Amazon y’all really have got to do better seriously!!! Never had a problem until now y’all are absolutely ridiculous and y’all’s customer service is a damn joke do better!!!,0
Another delivery on time and at a good price - very happy,2
I love Amazon and the related items are always relevant and tempting. Just a shame there's no store in Australia and I have to either pay a lot for postage or have things delivered to friends and then sent out.,1
"In the past 2 days, I have tried to get a decent answer for my issue with Amazon customer support, via email and via Phone (Jammie, Victoria, Melinda)On June 9 I emailed Amazon Customer service regards to a shipping fee concern. I was told by 2 different Amazon agents that I will be reimbursed for the shipping fees. Yet, now when asking for the refund, I was told It will not happen as the agents made a mistake.This is not my fault that your agent made a mistake in the answer they gave me, I’m expecting Amazon to take responsibility for its agent mistakes. If I knew you wouldn't stand behind your promise, I wouldn’t continue placing those orders (Shipping fee value $172) Such a bad experience with Amazon over this case Such a disappointment from Amazon, for not taking responsibility for their agent's mistakes.",0
"I have ordered titan watch of rs 5000 from amazon but that was too loose so I went to titan shop in season mall in pune I asked that person to remove 1 clip so he told me that this watch is not original titan not make this kind of model. It's a fake watch. I was very shocked that how come it is possible coz it's come with name and logo so I talked to my sister iwho is working with one Amazon dealer in mumbai and when i heard this from her mouth that time was speechless i wanted to share with u she told me that where she is working that dealer buy earphone in rs 20 from China packed with brand name and logo and they sell here of rs 1500 with brand name like JBL, Motorola, Sony and it's works almost 6 months and  no one can find it's fake. if when someone find that it's not working or some problem in their earphone that time can't replace it coz replacing time already gone.   It's very bad I will never ordered from Amazon. Amazon u just came before some years back and really means people can't go out and buy product whatever they want. even i.

"Amazon is amazing when it comes to customer service.  I had to return a damaged video card and they refunded my money before I even sent the card back, no questions asked.  Now I didn't use amazon again this time, but ordered from NEWEGG and I am having a horrible experience.  NewEgg is lying about my order process, been hung up on 3 times, been lied to twice, my new GPU has been in the ""packing"" stage for 5 days now.  This kind of behavior is unacceptable and this kind of behavior is not what Amazon does.  Amazon is the best!  Screw NewEgg!",2
Use Amazon every week.,2
Best site to shop,2
Not only shopping but resturns are also easy,2

1 star because i can't buy prime with giftcard1 star because (friday-saturday) less work here so it arrived day after one and didn't get anything from this problem.i paid for the shipping and got exact date when it suppose arrived. i dont hate amazon but should make it accurate.i would gave them 2 but i dont hate amazon (why? they dont have api for customers only for sellers),1
My most recent experience purchase no issue delivery on time. Discription size did not match on delivery posted message to seller no response left it a while WILL NOW CONTACT AMAZON SOON AS I GET CHANCE. I have left me with a sour experience as when orders are from Amazon directly there are no issues but 3rd party not so much will still shop with Amazon with a view to avoid 3rd party if possible.,2

"While not perfect and with a design that is looking a bit out of date, Amazon is still my preferred source for online shopping.

I've spent hours chasing them.  Paying Prime for next day delivery and lucky to get the parcels at all.  Needless to say I have now cancelled my subscription.  If you have an alternative company, use them.  Amazon is simply awful now!  Was told to raise a formal complaint, of which they didn't respond to.",0
Horrible experience I purchased a water jug and two 4lbs bags of mango candy’s typed in my debit card info and I was never charged for it and they emailed me hey you need to pay or we won’t ship it well it’s your fault because you never charged me for it I’m sticking with eBay and I’m forever shipping with ups,0
I have had far too many packages not arrive that say that they are delivered to a neighbour. They always seem to be the expensive items...need to get your ship in order and spend some of your profits on delivering what you promise!,0
Amazon has been around since my college days. That’s when only students could use prime. I have a love hate relationship with them. Yes I know they f’ up but they also fix the issue too. I have no complaints specifically that I can even think of.,1

"Generally a decent website and i love they fact they have almost everything i could ever want.  The Marketplace facility is also a great thing.  Generally shipment is very, very quick (i have received some things within 24 hours of ordering with normal shipment), but have had some problems trying to get things sorted when things have gone wrong. My big problem at the moment is my Kindle which failed.  It is a covered under warranty, but because i bought it at Atlanta airport while i was transiting, it has to be replaced in America.  As i don't live there, or have family/friends who do, it has meant having the replacement sent to a friend of a friend who will then send it to me.  Not exactly ideal, and i will still need to pay the costs to have it shipped from the US to Europe.  I also have to pay those costs to have the old one sent back (although i'm assuming these will be reimbursed).  This to me is a ridiculous system for an international company the size of Amazon.  They could easily have sorted it out to be sent to Europe, or be sent from a European warehouse, or even taken up my offer of paying any difference in price between the European model and the US one.  It's all a bit of a farce.",1

Always uses USPS even after reporting that we were having issues with them. Packages always lost cos they leave them a block away from our house.,1
"This company does not offer you prices that are better.  The quality of merchandise is very bad.  I had purchased for 150.00 a cage and it came broken, purchase 5 pairs of pants said to be made in the USA but were actually from China, lets just say the sides were all ripped within a few minutes of wear.. their ebooks (which they guarantee 7 day return) can actually be taken from you for no reason and they do not give you the money you purchased.  Their reason is that you are not actually the owner but just renting them.. You can not read them on any item other than something they sell so if you cancel your amazon then you loose everything you have purchased (e-books).  There are better places to make purchases that don't fatten their pocket book and cost you money, items that will be better.. I spent over 35000.00 on this company over the years and am now finding this out as well.  Every item I purchased were not American made (or even better quality) but were made from China.  Every single E-book I have had to fight to get back and the kindle fire that I purchased worked only for 7 months.. I had to download the application to read them on the computer which is a pain. This company does not look out for their customers just their pocket books.  Once again do not use this company, there are way better ones that make and sell better quality items.",0

I have had at least five average interactions with sellers from Amazon. I'm still waiting for refunds from months ago.,1
1. I singed up as a seller2. Amazon withdraw $49.99 from my CC3. I Can't list my items4. I contact Amazon and ask why. They say that Amazon no longer approve new sellers in my categoryWhy not let SELLERS know that BEFORE they sign up.Now they offer me a check as refund. They refuse to refund to CC. It would cost me over $15 to cash that check since i'm located outside of US.They are scammers!,0
"I'd give no stars if that was possible. When you get ripped off by one of their sellers, they don't stand by you. They give you the run around with their claim filing that never amounts to anything. They admit they owe you the money but never credit you. They keep trying to give me a lousy $5 credit to purchase something from their own company. All that means is you now need to spend more money instead of getting your full refund after returning the item.",0
I order all the time off Amazon. Sometimes they get my address correctly. Sometimes they don't. I'm fed up with it. It's happening most weeks now. And I've put a special instruction where my address is. Grrrrrrr 😣,1

with anything i have bought from Amazon or their partners....,2
I called for a missing order on an item and the customer service rep Marie found my problem got me a refund and authorized it in under 5 mins all while keeping a friendly attitude and keeping me updated. Made a stubbed toe feel like a massage :),2
"My usage is purely based on the website and processes, but overall amazon with get a 3/5.Purely because a lot of items are the site can 3rd party and made with cheap material while sellers sell items at a high price.However amazon do plenty of offers on normal everyday items and I've not had much issue when contacting them if I have problems.My only gripe would be that sometimes some items are sent out via other couriers such as Evri, DPD, Royal Mail etc, and I wish they would state on the order on the website that this chosen courier is delivering my parcel instead of an amazon courier.",1
"I've been a loyal amazon customer and I'm a little upset that the return policy is difficult. I ordered a large corset and it wouldn't even rap around my waist . I bought a size smaller so I could lose weight to get  into it but i can't because it will take me like 3-4 month to lose enough weight to squeeze my body i the small corset !!I feel like the packaging could b a little more friendly . Maybe some candy or a business card , but of course it's not up to Amazon.",1
I use aws services of Amazon. Its really outstanding.,2
"I cannot count how many times they've offered next day order and every time I've ordered within the time frame and with a purchase amount to meet the ""requirements"" and not once has any of it been delivered next day. Not once. Do not fall for it. And it appears some of their drivers are either illiterate or just lazy or both. I order all the time from Amazon because it is convenient but Temu offers much better deals and even though the shipping takes longer, they don't lie about that and you get a credit if it's late.",1
I am a vivd purchaser on Amazon books and other hardware. The best price and shipping dont always seem to be in par with reality. Great selection but quality is not what I expect.,1
"Where to begin.... shall we start with trespassing, going straight to the back door through a double latched gate without even attempting a front door delivery is unacceptable, oh and what about failed deliveries on time, I was paying for a service and next day was apart of it (yes there are some exceptions) within a 2 week period I have had 3 deliveries failed, 1 was 2 days late, another was ""accidentally sent to wrong distribution centre"" and then disappeared resulting in having to claim a refund 2 days later, latest is an item ordered and at checkout the usual order within next (xx time) for garenteed delivery xx date (next day) only to not even out for delivery let alone dispatched the next day, contacted (the joke they call customer service) to be told item is out of stock so I request cancellation,  two hours later checking order details notice cancellation request not actioned so do it myself only to receive email to say cancellation cannot be actioned as order is in processing. Absolutely ridiculous, Amazon was once a good company with high standards, now I would put more faith in a politician not telling a lie.....",0
"There’s a reason Bezos is loaded.So convenient. Amazon Prime Now is actually scary for my bank balance.Wish they’d provide a more intuitive and dependable refund support, though. Have been ripped off twice by independent stores.",1
I find Amazon amazing.Their deliveries are pretty close to being on timeI got my mypillow in one day. Forget to buy a gift. Order one and it'll be there tomorrow. Even if you ask them to gift wrap it,2
"Original order was soaked with activa a clorox product..all items soaked. Resent expired toothpaste twice. Opened a amazon account original order. Said no charge. Amazon charged my card for bad products. Transfered 4 times said synchrony(Amazon card) was phishing....they wanted a payment. Amazon charged me on that card after being told no you won't be charged.  THE PAYMENT WAS PAST DUE I WASNT AWARE.  NOW MY CREDIT CARD (amazon) turned my late payment into the credit bureau I have no faith in Amazon. I'm canceling the Amazon card. Never using them again. This is a bad place to buy from. I have no faith in Amazon and will NEVER again....Will also tell the 6,000 people I work with. DONT GET A AMAZON CARD.",0
I love Amazon!! Incredibly reliable and will always sort out any mishaps that may occur. I buy everything off Amazon.One of the best online shopping websites I have ever used.,2
The customer service is always AMAZING!!! So helpful and friendly and resolves any situation. I shop a lot with Amazon and this is the reason why. Makes a huge difference and the experience much more pleasurable than other companies.,2
"NOT HAPPY! I placed a big order that cost 455$, i was not only charged 455 twice, but amazon is giving the hardest time about getting that payment back. i provided amazon with the upmost proof to show i was charged  twice. not only have i been dealing with dispute since 3/04/2020 now i am being ignore via email. when i call the agents are confused to what i am talking about. at this point i am canceling my account and will be doing business else where. i will say this is the first time it has happen since i been a customer since 2015. thanks Quilla",0
Always works for me,2
Censoring is for communists. You don’t deserve to be on American soil. You are a disgrace.,0
"What's Not too love! Order, delivered to the hedge... So some of the drivers are impatient! But over all excellent service within 24hours on most things, some items are a bit s h I t e and break but again no fuss returns as long as it didn't come from a third party seller. Mainly fabulous could do better.",2
"I bought a product from amazon and the parameters do not correspond. The problem is that I cannot even write a review, saying the profile is not eligible, even though I bought the product, and tried it, and it doesn't work... I cannot inform other people about the issue and other people will buy too this garbage product. The excuse is that I have to spend more than usd 50 in order to write a review.This is the product I bought and it is counterfeit, it doesn't work. Even though it says the same name, it is not the original: ACS108-6SN from Paialu on Amazon. I do not recomend it.",0
My wife bought an item at a low price  during cyber mon .nov 26.on the item was supposed tobe here on dec 8 got a message it had changed to dec 21.the item had never been shipped. After several calls come  to fi d find out they never had it in stock.never any feed ba k fro. Amozon.  She orderd shoes around the same time got a notification  they were running  late and was eligible for a  refund.  When she called about the refund she was treated very badly and basically  the guy called her a liar. Several phone calls later nothing was resolved.  We  have been cust for lo g time but no more.,0
There shipment is limited. They Should ship all items to singapore I suggest,1
"I believe giving them 3 stars is a fair rating. My usages with Amazon is similar to a love hate relationship. At times, the items I ordered gets delivered on time and in perfect condition which I am very grateful of. But other times, my items are either slightly damaged or late. I had to return them and it will take ages for the item to be sent back before a replacement arrives. Dilemma indeed!",1
customer service sucks ass! i've been requesting a refund for over a month on a delivered not here and to this date im still asking for almost $250 in a refund and been waiting business days till im sick. THEN THE REP HAD THE ADUACITY TO SAY HE'S TRANSFERRING ME AND CUT OFF THE CHAT. ALEX is the name and a supervisor named UMESH didnt even spend long on the chat just sent a form and ended it so fast i didnt even get to blink.,0
Love the offers on prime day sale. Fast shipping and customer reviews for products help get the right product. Specially the video reviews on the website are very helpful.,2
My favorite company. My challenge is that they are holding my over $200 of gift card. They said the card is invalid. How can a card I bought be invalid after using some part of it?,1
I have had many items from amazon. Like they products and delivery very good to excellent.,2
Ordered and it came - perfect,2
"Mostly acceptable - many counterfeit items are being found more recently though, which is a shame. Other than that, it's alright.",1
"I ordered a box of malteaser truffles from amazon and i just want to say it was great! Fast delivery, good price and the product was perfect and delicous",2
what can I say .. good,2
"on order time. When I order sometime for one day order I need it the next day. After ordering, they always switch up the time and say it will come in 2-3 days. If I wanted to wait that long,",1
"Makes finding unusual gifts a breeze, everything you need from sheet music to bongos.",2
"Legit, it is what it seems.",2
Sweets in the City fantastic service best of all sweets were amazing 👍,2
I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.,2
"Has it's decents and has its averages... Not sure what outweighs what.Having Prime means next day order - more and more frequently order is being delayed. When you are able to speak to an agent, they offer compensation however this is never actually applied to your account. The last adviser I spoke to Hazel was very rude. I attempted to report her however was unable to do so.",1
"OK - not sure about their human rights ethics, but delivered my orders ok in my time of need",1

Very slow still waiting for a package to be delivered from usa to berlin!!,1
Great company to deal with!,2
This company is the worst company I've ever dealt with the delivery drivers are absolutely horrible they opened Mt front door and threw a parcel into my living room when I managed to get intouch with customer chat they kept ending the chat on me on purpose about 3 times they say that orders had been delivered when they hadn't they have left parcels in my bin when I've asked them not to they are a disgrace and want closing down,0
Prices suck sometimes and shipping is awful unless you have prime.,1
"Ordered an item from Amazon, says it's been delivered, but it hasn't, absolutely fuming, I am cancelling all my Amazon subscriptionsEdit: to add insult to injury, they told me to go and knock on doors to try and find my parcel, No, it should of been delivered to my address",0
Consistent as always. no issues.,2
"Ordered a package that said it was fulfilled by Amazon and eligible for prime shipping.... then it gave me some stupid 2 week away window..... They shipped through this absolute joke of a company called landmark global (if you search for them you find nothing but poor reviews on this scumbag cancerous operation).... they shipped within 2 days to New York (I am in Alberta Canada) then it sat there for 2 weeks! suffice to say they blew right through their ""window"" I called Amazon to see what the hell was going on as I needed the goods ordered.... both agents were less than useful and hard to understand, they told me to wait another week!, finally after 4 days it updated that it has shipped to ontario and god knows how much longer it will be.... I order a lot of stuff through amazon so this disaster of an experience is making me second guess that decision, not impressed at all. what a joke.",0
"Order arrived soon the expected, thank you",2
"I ordered a box of pancake mix from Amazon in July that wasn’t delivered until a couple of days ago, nearly 4 months later. The box also arrived soggy. Not only did Amazon do nothing to rectify the situation, when I tried to write a review with constructive criticism about my experience, Amazon refused to post it.",0
"Everyone goes to the store to search for what they want and when it comes to online shopping it is very convenient. Amazon is a very well-known and great place to go online and shop for certain products. Although, Amazon is literally taking over the world and making businesses and companies out of business it is still the best online shopping place, because service can be extremely fast, there are lots of discounts on products, and the products are just very useful.My family has amazon prime and we can buy products and get them in two days. You even get discounts too, there was a product that my parents were gonna buy for $60, but with amazon prime the price went down to $20. Can you believe it? Although, many businesses and companies are going out of business, Amazon has everything you need at a good price and good shipping. Amazon is a very great place to shop and their products are always in good condition,  hopefully they never run out of business.",2

"Over priced items are cheaper on eBay, order was not on time and was done through Prime trial. Products are not free order because special order is 'then added at checkout' which makes it dubious to reconcile. 😒",1
"Amazon is a very good sites in online shopping and there is almost everything you need and displays the items in a good way, but the problem is the delay in shipping and price if solved this problem to become Amazon one of the best shopping sites in the world.Thank you...",2
Customer support was unable to make a trade in for the newest Kendal fire. I bought in July of 2018.  They offered me 20.00 dollars for a just out of warranty goods. Because their was no option listed to trade it in on their website. This is horrible. Be aware of their policies before ever buying any electronics of any kind,1
"I’ve never had this big of a problem with Amazon before and have been a happy Prime customer for years. Ordered something for next day delivery which was due today, I’d received the expected time and had the ‘8 stops away notification’, I could see that the driver was only a few streets away. I’d been waiting all afternoon for it to turn up and was sitting in the living room with full view of the street and whoever comes to my front door.I then noticed I had the ‘delivered successfully, handed to resident’ notification. This was obviously a flat out lie or mistake as a delivery driver hadn’t even been on my street, let alone delivered it to me by hand. Tried to speak to Amazon straight away but they have the cheek to advise ‘ask all of your neighbours, look around the outside of your house and wait 24 hours before you contact us’. This may be right in some cases but not when a driver has blatantly lied. I spoke to an associate, the first one wasn’t very helpful at all and said that the delivery could still be delivered up to next tuesday even though it was literally out for delivery and apparently handed to me. I find it ridiculous that they claim to have no way of contacting the driver that had the parcel to ask them what’s gone wrong. I have no idea what’s happened to my parcel, has it been delivered to a completely different person on another street? Still in the van and driver just lied about delivering it? Gotten mysteriously lost? To be fair, the second associate was helpful in that she gave me a full refund straight away but I was gutted as I really wanted the item and had bought it on special offer which has now ended.Amazon need to introduce a feature where they take photos upon delivering because I would love to know what’s happened here. I don’t think I’ll be ordering anything off there any time soon or if at all after this.",0
Amazon makes shopping so convenient and affordable. They have a huge selection and their prices are almost always the lowest anywhere. Free two-day shipping is an incredible deal and I highly recommend you join Amazon Prime.,2
"I mean it's really not that average. Although I usually just get a free trial, and order something once a year. But when I do the goods is decent. ",1
"cant fault them. good prices, next day delivery, saves money",2
They do not care at all about their buyers or sellers. They just want your money.,0
always found what i had been looking for,2

The app has been super buggy and frankly impossible to add my address to. It just says uh oh something went wrong. Their website isn't much better and they still owe me 150 usd and 30 usd for shipping on an item I ordered two years ago that I never heard a word about after nor received anything. Except lies and excuses. They said it was in transit they said that 7 times after months and months of waiting. They said they would refund me. They never did.  Their prices have also skyrocketed but today's npc society are really damn stupid and much like they will pay any price for the garbage apple throws at them the same is applicable with Amazon prices now that it's become so ubiquitous as a company. Avoid them if possible.,0
you cant get through to customer services it cuts you off the minute you call they send labels you cant use if you cant use a computer you are stuck amazon wont help you l asked for a straight forward label to take to my evri shop across the road they sent me one you have to print..l dont know how to use a computer .. customer service are arrogant and unhelpful l dont recommend either amazon or ebay,0
Awful service. Item didn't arrive even though paid for next day delivery. They offered a refund but no apology. I now have to wait 7 working days for a refund. Will not shop from them again.,0

Amazon!!  The drivers are horrible it's as if they cannot read. They don't even bother to ring the doorbell to let you know you have a package at 10 o'clock at night!  And then it's not even my package it belongs to my neighbor! Then when I call  It takes a 1/2 an hour to get to a human being and then they say to return the package I received then they will send my item ... So now they want me to return my neighbor's product back to them and then they'll replace mine--which means my neighbor will not get their package because the delivery drivers either can't read or they don't care. I'm not sure who's running Amazon deliveries but they don't have a clue what their drivers are doing.,0
It’s amazing what we as a nation are ok with. Amazon the fact you have two women kissing in a commercial yet no one else in the commercial is. Stop trying to force things upon everyone. I do not force my beliefs on other people don’t force what you believe and support on me. Do what you do and that is sell things.,0
The site is a mess but the customer service is usually efficient and the returns are easy!,2
"Bought quite a few gadgets from Amazon. Cameras, Satnav, Kindle etc. Good price, quick delivery. Thats what I like...",2
Always happy with their customer service. I just wish that they have a better quality control/check on the products sold as sometimes the quality is not so good.,2
I have made several purchases from Amazon and never been disapointed. Would reccomend this company to anyone.,2
"Seeing Amazon grow over the years has been great to see the expansion in available items and its great to go to one place for many different types of decents. The problem with Amazon is that when you have faulty decents or problems they arent always very helpful. I had a hardware fault which was an inherent manufacturer defect but Amazon said i had no rights to claim a repair or replacement from them (They say the Sale of decents act is a load of rubbish) i had to go through the courts in the end to get them to deal with my faulty decents. Also ordinary if you have to return damaged decents, its at your own expense and in most cases they dont even pay back the cost of your postage charges of recorded shipment so the item is traceable in the mail.Not a decent way for a company to work.",1
Great way to do business quick and easy,2
"As an Amazon Prime user who frequents both the Instant Video function and the main wesbite I can say - to a tee, this is one of the best services i've ever dealt with.Customer Support - 10/10      Customer Support Staff seem to always go out of their way to try and help you with an issue, and the majority of the time will compensate you for your troubles. I was given 1 month free of Prime for my RX480 GFX Card being 2 days later than it was supposed too.I was given 2 months free of Prime and a full refund for a product being over a week late.Instant Video - 10/10     No issues with load times and/or buffering. Streaming Service works well which is better than some others.ConsAmazon sellers and Amazon themselves have to pay people to deliver your product, these people tend to be the only issue in a well oiled machine and are an issue with any online retailer.",2
"Usually 5 as a prime customer but not very happy recently. Made me wait nearly 2 months for face masks I have been wearing them since beginning of March with disposable gloves and goggles when going out as they are helpful to helping prevent not entirely the risk of infection when going out. I understand things are difficult but these are priority items and should not be delayed. Luckily since Lockdown started I am not going out much only for food shopping as food shopping online is impossible. Usually very acceptable having purchased face masks, a digital thermometer for my mother which came with a dead battery ( I had to change it) but it works fine for her now. And for a number of law books for me which they have normally been very acceptable at order and the Flash Speed mop which I tried to get in stores but gave up and got it in Amazon. I do like Amazon but on one occasion items have been delivered to next door instead of our address and it's a acceptable job they are honest neighbours. Good but could be better as my items are unnecessarily being delayed by up to a month now as a Prime customer with essential items they should not be delayed.",1
"HORRIBLE service! Never got two of the items I had ordered on 4/5 that was supposed to be here by the next day 4/6. By 4/12 I had contacted them TWICE asking what's going on after I had gotten a notice that the delivery had been CANCELED as I did NOT cancel the order. The 1st time I contacted them and asked them why the order had been canceled they claimed the order was NOT canceled and that I should get it soon (LMAO YEAH RIGHT). even though my tracking link said otherwise that my order was being sent back to amazon as they had canceled it. 5 DAYS LATER STILL NO DELIVERY. Such a waste of time and they are such CROOKS! Just want your money and think you will forget about it! TOTAL SCAM! I don't see how Amazon is allowed to stay in business with such SHADY business practices. They finally gave me a refund after telling me the order WAS CANCELED like I had told them it was originally, so I could reorder, and they had also told me they would refund me a month's payment of PRIME for my trouble and all the TIME I wasted since the product did NOT come in a timely manner as it did not even come at ALL! Now I am STILL waiting for my refund for THAT. I'm sure I will have to contact them AGAIN about that to get my refund for my membership. Will be canceling membership ASAP as they have gone downhill and cannot support such a crappy business who does NOT EVEN HONOR THEIR OWN PROMISES AND DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. JUST GROSS!  Customers should NOT have to keep at a company over and over again to ensure that the company does WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL. DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON. IT IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE. Would give ZERO stars if I could!! :/",0
Brilliant service from amazon everything we get from them are top quality and can't fault them qith being a prime member get everything next day always deliver,2
Pain in the ass on every ways with paying extra too.,0
"It has become very obvious that Amazon intentionally delays their free shipping, probably so people upgrade shipping methods and pay more.  I just recently ordered something they have in stock sold from amazon, and was told it would ship from amazon a week(7days) later. What is up with that? Two days later I cancelled my amazon order, ordered from somewhere else(shipped same day), and still got my package delivered 3 days before amazon was to even ship it! You can read all about this on amazons own forum, hundreds of people wondering WHY amazon has become so slow past couple years.  All i can say is im not going to wait if better assistance is out there for basically same price, people will catch on, and go somewhere else, naturally.",1

I shouldn’t take 3 days to prepare a order to ship I’ve never seen such a slow an a business that don’t care about there customers time to step up a few levels Amazon an customer service.,0
Hi have just ordered  my grocery  from Morrisons delivered by Amazon on Friday to be delivered  between 4..0pm to 6.0pm did not arrive did not have the transport  to deliver so decided  to reorder for the Saturday  ordered in the morning  to be delivered  between 6.0pm and 8.0pm received  a message  from Amazon approx 7.30pm to be told we are having trouble finding transport to deliver your goods could you wait until 10.30pm before  you or we cancel the order so this one was cancelled  as the first order.  This service  is a shambles ,0

"I'm thrilled with my recent Amazon clothing purchase! I ordered the CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts and it has exceeded my expectations in every way.The fit is absolutely perfect, and I appreciate the accurate sizing chart provided by the seller. The fabric is soft, comfortable, and of high quality, making it a pleasure to wear all day. Plus, it's even better in person than in the pictures - the color is vibrant and hasn't faded after multiple washes.What truly impressed me was the attention to detail in the design. The stitching is impeccable, and I haven't encountered any loose threads or issues with the seams. This piece not only looks fantastic but feels well-made.The delivery was prompt, and the packaging was eco-friendly, which I appreciate.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The CATHY womens casual short sleeve T-Shirts is now a staple in my wardrobe, and I've received numerous compliments whenever I wear it. I'll definitely be exploring more clothing options from this brand in the future. Highly recommend![Hafsat Abdulkadir]",2
bad shop i dont like,0
"i feel amazon is a good website,I bought many things from Amazon downloads and E books as well.Everything I've bought has come very quickly and many of them have been free p&p.",2
"Honestly, I had purchased on Amazon before and I never had problems with any of my orders. But recently, I decided to purchase shoes on Amazon and I had the most stressful experience. When I ordered my shoes, I kept tracking it and everything was going well and I liked how Amazon always tells you when your shipment will arrive. On the day my shipment was suppose to arrive, i checked my tracking information and it said it was being sent back to seller with no explanation. When I reached out to the seller he explained to me he didn't know why either and that id receive a refud. I was very annoyed and confused but I gave amazon another chance because like I said before, I have had good experiences with Amazon. So I decided to just purchase the same shoes from another seller on Amazon and when I did everything was going well until on the day the shipment was suppose to arrive AGAIN. On this day, I logged on to check my tracking info and it said UPS was unable to deliver my package. I contacted an Amazon Agent and they told me that my address was incomplete and I needed to contact UPS to complete it. Mind you my product was delivered and at a UPS near me. When I contacted UPS to complete my address they told me that it was a huge change of address if I completed it,So UPS told me to contact Amazon to complete the address. when I spoke to another Amazon Agent they said they couldn't complete my address either because the carrier had the product. At this point I'm calling UPS and Amazon back and forth to complete my address and no one can do it. Finally UPS told me I could pick it up at the UPS ware house but I needed an ID. And I couldn't pick it up because I always use a Nickname online shopping. If Amazon could have told me my address was incomplete as soon as I purchased my product, I would not have gone through all of this. That was the most stressful online experience I've ever had at that point I just canceled my order.",0
I love the fact that I can buy anything on Amazon!  They have helped me when a company sent me an inferior product that I bought through them and have allowed me to sell my own products.,2
The item was way smaller than described/expected.,1
They charge 2.99 for overnight delivery or faster delivery and 9 times out of 10 you order will say delivered but it’s not there. It usually shows up but that’s not what I payed extra for. They should take the charge off if they are late on delivery.,0
Amazon is really starting to drop the ball on every level. My PRIME shipping is constantly late and their prices is steadily going up. I have contacted customer service about the shipments not arriving on time and the rep talks about nothing they can do! I have been told they will refund the product because it has not met the shipping date and then been charged for it months later! I will definitely be dropping my Prime membership especially many other companies starting to offer free shipping and quicker shipping. A once great company thats become a sham!,0
"I've been an Amazon customer since 2004. However, I will no longer be using Amazon due to the handling of Parler and will not be renewing my subscription. I've run my entire house and filled my family's every need with Amazon service. I'm always happy to see a business become successful and I understand Amazon doesn't have to do business with Parler. But how Amazon shut down this new business and has blacklisted them from getting help from other service providers is shameful. Amazon obviously forgot what it's like being the little guy, so my family and I want to remind them. Not having my business will not hurt them in the least. As a matter of fact, it will hurt my family more. But they've lost the respect of this family...if they ever cared what their customers thought.",0
Every time I order from Amazon I always get my packages in a timely manner and I always get what I pay for. ,2
"Amazon is another great American business ethics failure. Placed several items in my cart with a promised delivery date of 12/18-12/22 for all the items, then I ordered the items and paid. Guess what, as soon as they got my money they changed the delivery dates to 12/22-12-28 and 1/2-1/8. Needed items for Christmas, so of course I was a bit furious. Will never buy from them again. Amazon should be broken up by the gov't.",0

"Returned a gtv formula box item had already been open the batteries out the packaging other packaging opened and  they got there it’s back within 3 days and held my refund for another 4 days after I had to call to get them to process the refund then they tell me it’s gonna be another 7 to 10 days for me to get it probably sometime in {xxxxx} July. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had do not shop at Amazon . They ain’t nothing but a bunch of crooks selling a bunch of generic stuff and then when you complain about them selling you stuff that’s been open they don’t want to take the stuff back or take their time about giving your money, we need to go back to shopping stores and leave Amazon Amazon right where it is the Customer Service can’t even understand they barely can speak English ",0
"Always a great service, I’m amazed how they manage to provide the deliveries on time day after day. Customer service has been excellent over the phone always helpful for any minor hiccups.",2
I am a vivd purchaser on Amazon books and other hardware. The best price and shipping dont always seem to be in par with reality. Great selection but quality is not what I expect.,1
"I ordered a shower curtain, from amazon. It was about $25.00 or so, I wasn't happy with the curtain, so I set up a return with amazon, they picked it up a few days later, got an email from amazon, they got the package, and where refunding $15.00 to my account. With no heads up, where keeping half your money. So that will be the LAST item I buy from amazon. I wouldn't have given them a 1 star rating.",0
"I really love the goods range at Amazon.com However, the saddest part is:1. It doesnt ship most of the articles to India2. Even if they ship, the shipping cost is awkwardly high (for example, I was ordering few articles totalling to 50 USD and the shipping charge on them was 180 USD) If I really need something from Amazon, I need to give an US address and then ask someone to carry it to India for me. Had the shipping been regular to India, I, as well as many I know, would have definitely used a lot of assistance from Amazon.",1
Tremendous range of products with no delivery charge on many.,2
Allways get 1st class service.,2
"Ordered PlayStation Portal cost £199. Parcel arrived with a totally different item, informed Amazon straight away and returned incorrect item. Had an illegal transaction from Amazon weeks later they took another £199 from my account for the PS Portal that was NEVER RECEIVED! They are refusing to refund the money so I am now going to take legal action against them. DON'T USE THIS COMPANY!",0
"Wonderful platform, Brilliant support provider.  I’m a Fan and it’s worth every penny! Always receive items the next day. Very efficient! This is the only shipment support that I can count on as have been let down by others this Always.",1
Review text not found,1
They are acceptable about some things but there are some thing on the site that when you buy the will not get back to you. They will take you money and not return it or get back to you on where it’s at.,1
Products are overall pretty acceptable. But shipment is horrible. So many things have not been delivered on time. UPS delivered way better than Uber or prime shipment trucks. Very frustrating.,1
"I've used 20£ gift voucher code and Amazon has blocked my account asking to provide a purchase receipt for the gift card, spoke to the customer service twice, explained it was a gift, so no receipt is avalable, provided with a screenshot of social media where the code from my friend was received, no result, they keep sending me the same request and wont unblock my account until receipt is received, also emailed the customer relationship team, total ignorance. Thought Amazon was a decent company, can see now how I was wrong, disgusting how they treat their customers. What is more they keep charging me for Amazon Prime despite they don't let me use my account. Unbelievable!!!",0
"Amazon has always been my go to. Especially with having prime... unfortunately, it’s not often I have problems with my items when I receive them. My biggest issue is with the shipment. The drivers tend to constantly leave my parcels in stupid places (like right on the doorstep for the whole road to see?) so I’ve had quite a few disappoint situations with not receiving my items after recieving confirmation it’s been left in a “safe place”. Delivery guys tend to knock and just walk off also. Which confirms that if I wasn’t in. They would have just left it.",1
It took longer than expected and the customer assistance was not the best ,1
Amazon is great Quite pleased to say that my deliveries have improved recently due to multiple complaints I had. So far I'm very happy and have used this company on a regular basis recently. I hope my deliveries will keep improving and that couriers will read the instructions that they are given.,1
"The best place to shop, always get my products like i want it",2
"I've been ordering from Amazon Prime for about 3 or more yrs. Now with the usual mis delivered items but In the last year it has been getting worse.Now they have this new thing when they deliver your package they send you a picture of your back porch. Trouble is, it's not always your porch. I have pointed this out several times but they'd rather shine you On with an obligatory sorry and a couple of bucks. Not to mention you pay an additional $119. for Prime -  1 to 2 day shipping . This week I ordered And promised my 5 yr. Old granddaughter a Dodger hat, glove, and 2 balls by Wednesday. Wrong. Wrong porch. Told them and said send driver lbackout to get and redilever. Nope, too easy, will resend. Another two days. Hat came in mail, thank decentness. Promised my granddaughter a Dodger hat n ball to help make up for it. Supposed to get Friday. Wrong again. Same porch, not mine. Sent text as soon as I got the picture and quite aggravated now with a crying granddaughter i immediately send a text to send driver back out now and pick up my items and deliver to me. That didn't happen. Next day I find the obligatory sorry again. Was quite upset by now and have to take nitroglycerin tabs for the chest pains they created and let them know it too. So needless to say, no reply, no baseball no bat and no resolution. Could that driver live there or know someone there?? Does that person need glasses??? I'm my opinion Amazon condones the theft of packages not belonging to addresses not to mention opening other people's mail. Found out open someone's mail from your mailbox. It's a federal pffense. You give it back. I guess when you get that big you can treat common people however you want. They should remember when they weren't so big and who helped them get there. I'm a big Dodger can having been born in NYC. First game I went to and only games were Brooklyn Dodgers. Now we carry the torch for LA Dodgers. This is so disappointing how they treat people. Thank you Trustpilot, for listening.  And here it is Monday and you guessed it. No bat, no ball no response,no consideration for the consumer. Why would you think I ordered that. To see someone else get it. So much for 20 + years in the military. My husband fought in Korean war and two tours in Vietnam and he can't even get our 5/6 year old granddaughter some Dodger stuff. Guess that's a thank you for your assistance we'll not soon forget. But don't waste any time collecting that $119. Prime membership. Soery, yes, we're quite upset.",1
"The company is so big and offers so many different supports in so many locations that it is quite difficult to give it one general grade.The most frequent problem I had was with the couriers, who often are unable to follow the order instructions or do not even attempt to deliver the item.However, the customer support is always helpful. They always throw a few pounds sweetener or a free month of Prime membership. Occasionally I get to keep the wrong item I received - they refund it but ask me to NOT send it back. When their pick up courier was consistently failing to arrive, they offered a full refund for sending the parcel myself via whatever courier I want.",1
"Nice, not more",1
I returned 3 items posted from ireland to UK. I did not print  their return label as no access to printer but I wrote it out and posted at postofficr that's over 2 months ago Thought I've been in contact with customer service several times they refuse to refund me even thought I sent snapshot of receipt as proof of sending they say it doesn't have tracking number .I would have had to send by registered mail to recive this and cost more so I sent by ordinary mail did not think I'd have an issue.they have refused to refund me saying the receipt is invalid not true.they said because label written not printed no refund.but fact remains I returned items improvised the details order numbers etc and posed back they will not help me at all.ive purchased hundreds of euro worth of goods over the years with amazon and now being so shabbily treated never again,0
"AMAZON is FOR BUYERS not SELLERS! they rip you off and charge you an arm and leg for selling stuff. I literally sold over $800 dollars worth of books and ended up with $350 due to the fees and I had the seller option which was 80 bucks a month if you have tons of listings. I thought it would help me, but either way they get you. Plus their are so many TROLLS that buy your new books and return the same book but used! They get away with it too! I had that happen, had proof of the fraud, and they still took the money out of my account! I am done selling with them. I would rather sell elsewhere!",1
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve goodss with so-so quality,1
"We order all books, download TV shows & Movies, dog toys, hair care, gluten free food, ect. Every time I walk into a electronic store I double check to see if Amazon has a better price and they usually do. I even bought a $2 mouse pad from Amazon the other day. Free Shipping & No Tax, straight to my door in 2 days. Can't get easier and cheaper then that!",2
"I sell on line and have for 13 years, all positive feed backs. I decided to use Amazon check-out. Big mistake when my client used it they held the money, it sold on July 2nd and I have yet to receive payment. The buyer has the item. They informed me that if I wanted payment quicker that I needed join some organization and get some kind of number for a fee of $229.00 to verify I am a legit seller . Truth be told Amazon most likely has stock in this company. There is nothing on Amazon about this, until you sell something of course. They only want big shoebox businesses not small merchants.I have tried to cancel my account and have no where to do it. I was able to delete my credit card info. Now I continually get messages to update my credit card info, FAT CHANCE. Avoid this merchant processing engine. Check out Ripoff site.Amazon has resolved the issue! It has changed my opinion.",2
"Sent me the wrong order, then wanted me to return it before issuing a refund or replacement. The item didn't arrive for my sons birthday on time due to this. This is Amazons mistake not mine. Ordered the new item of ebay.",0
"this is the first place i visit for DVDs and books, i've got so many bargains from this store and they were all new purchases!",2
"Someone ordered on my account, 28 water balloons and 11 floor scrubbers and had them sent to my address, but I declined the delivery as I did NOT order these items. I had to cancel my credit card due to this! It had to be an Amazon employee, as no one else had access to my information. Maybe someone thought it would be funny, it was not!",0
Jersa mae Thanks for your support. Amazon is a best website to use it and get the items very fast.Good customer service amazing staff. Mr Jersa mae wonderful person handling customer solutions and very polite. Am soo thankful amazon for delivering the product fast and wonderful staff handling the customer kind. Once again thanks Mr jersa mae,2
Amazon have a simple business model your order from them lot of items.When you send an item back for a refund they don’t refund you.They keep the money. An insidious untrusted platform,0
"Great products, Delivered on time ",2
"Over the years I've watched amazon continue onto a decline. They lost my package, and trying to contact their support team was an absolute nightmare. At the end of it all I just sucked it up and moved along. Still, I do love the fast shipping and easy returns",1
"World's apart, the difference between ordering on .co.uk and .com Amazon sites. Damaged goods, customer service extremely unhelpful, down a few hundred dollars from shoddy sellers and CS unable / unwilling to intervene! Shame, because the .co.uk site seems to run so much better.",0
"Like many people I have used Amazon quite often over the years and although the assistance is generally quite decent, shipment does tend to let them down during both peak and off peak periods.  I cannot fault however the downloads, especially the ebooks. Fast, efficient, simple!",1
"Their customer support has declined severely in the last few years. They only solve my problem about 30% of the time now with some struggle when before it was always one and done with very positive usage. Now, not so much...",1
Terrible customer service. Do not order to Thailand. Ordered 3 months ago and still waiting. Asked for refund. Still waiting.,0
"Just got off the phone with Amazon. If you ever follow their instructions to cancel a shipment that has been shipped via Amazon Logistics, don't. If they always ship to you via their Amazon Logistics, think about it seriously. If the courier marks the package as ""refused"" and doesn't return it to an Amazon facility, Amazon will try to refuse the refund if one of their ""top notch"" couriers decides you don't need the item but they do. According to Amazon Customer Service, I am responsible for THEIR courier. I don't remember that job interview..",0
"Usually 5 as a prime customer but not very happy recently. Made me wait nearly 2 months for face masks I have been wearing them since beginning of March with disposable gloves and goggles when going out as they are helpful to helping prevent not entirely the risk of infection when going out. I understand things are difficult but these are priority items and should not be delayed. Luckily since Lockdown started I am not going out much only for food shopping as food shopping online is impossible. Usually very decent having purchased face masks, a digital thermometer for my mother which came with a dead battery ( I had to change it) but it works fine for her now. And for a number of law books for me which they have normally been very decent at shipment and the Flash Speed mop which I tried to get in stores but gave up and got it in Amazon. I do like Amazon but on one occasion items have been delivered to next door instead of our address and it's a decent job they are honest neighbours. Good but could be better as my items are unnecessarily being delayed by up to a month now as a Prime customer with essential items they should not be delayed.",1
"Been a customer for few years and as time goes on I'm reminded why I was hesitant to create an account.  Don't get me wrong they have loads of brands, variety, and prices many times are better than the seller's own website's but all acceptable things on the surface have hidden costs. More than half the time shipment days change often without any explanations. Once I received a completely different goods than I ordered and couldn't get the proper goods from that seller so had to go through similar items to find a more pricey deal anyways. They did gift card the price but many times I've received items that barely resemble the ad and certainly weren't the quality the reviews said so it makes you wonder how do they stay on top? IMO humans are lazy, we don't want to have to go to five stores to get five types of things combined with free shipping that only seems free. I would also guess Amazon knows what other mega stores online or not do:you don't need the best quality if you have enough items just a bit cheaper than the competition and become a one stop shop. Ultimately my choice to go with Amazon for goodss, or not, isn't likely to change their business model as look at their profits year over year. But that's just one opinion among hundreds of millions and I've interactiond some sellers that have quality goodss and they probably want a piece of the $$$ that comes with being connected to the fifth largest company worldwide, I can understand that. Good luck, read reviews and log every order. ",1
I have to say amazon did a fine job in retuning an items.I can see are not perfect..but this time they did well. Fruugo in the other hand never did.,1
Been great customer service has been helpful when there's been an issue which in my experience is few and far between. Love giveaways in the couple years I've been doing them I've won a few time and it's kinda fun seeing the variety of products that are posted there.,2
Not really accessible to people outside of USA - but other than that the assistance is okay.,1
Got stuff from amazon but arrived in multiple deliveries. I would have preferred a single shipment.,1
"I've used Amazon on numerous occasions, ordering cd's, dvd's, photographic equipment, books, gift vouchers etc. and have always had great service. My items have all been received on time and have been exactly as described. I always use the Super Saver offer where applicable and this has saved me a substantial amount in postal fees.",2
"I just wanted to join free trial for 7 days for prime. I added my credit card and this TRASH company charged me endless times.. first for 12.99, then for 1,74 x 4 times.. So I ended paying too much for free trial. Last time i am going to this site... for sure. STAY AWAY GUYS",0
Amazon is the best...  At least in the USA  I never had an issues with them.  If something happens  I always got my money back with the a-z claim. Compared to any other site Amazon is the best for sure,2
nice ppl kakakkakakakk,2
Try Book Depository as prices are frequentky cheaper and you get free shipping.  Amazon seems to have a larger range though.,1
"A mixed bag. Orders are great when they work, returns are a hassle and customer support are whatever they could find the cheapest.",1
Amazons 3rd party sellers are horrible. I ordered wheels from one seller and tires from another. The wheels are lost somewhere in transit and the tires where delivered  missing 2 out of 5 tires.Amazon needs better rules and guidelines to be a 3rd party seller.,0
"Absolute poo, poo costumer service, poo products, poo delivery. They lie constantly. When they dont feel like sending you a refund directly in account they tell you they tried and bank rejected. THE BANK WILL NEVER REJECT A REFUND, not only that but they dont even have the capability of rejecting any refunds. They ignore me on why they lie and tell me to wait for a call so they can give me a gift card…basically to make sure they keep the money.",0
"The last person i spoke with was very rude, and was basically telling me that it's my fault that my order was delivered messed up. I ordered the shorts needing them for an event tomorrow, but they were delivered today ripped. So, now not only do i have to go out spend more money to buy more, and even told her i didn't want or need the refund that i still want the shorts only to be told that a replacement was unavailable and that i need to send in the shorts and wait for them to be received processed before i can be refunded, so i simply asked are you kidding me then she wants to get an attitude saying no she isn't kidding and that it can take 30 days or more to get them processed for a refund i still even asked if there was any way possible for me to get my refund into my Ammazon gift card balance so that i could order another pair to which she was again rude as hell saying no i had to not only wait the 30 plus days for the refund to be issued but i have to wait another 10 days for it to go back to my card. So, satisfied sadly after this refund is processed i will no longer bee ordering anything from Amazon again, and i took screen shots of the conversation and how rude this person was and i will be on every platform i can find leaving reviews about this. So, not only did Amazon lose me as a customer today but they also lost everyone of my family members and friends that use Amazon. We will be ordering from TikTok shop and ebay from now on. TikTok shop usually has better prices and neither one of them have ever been rude like this to me before and never have i ever had something delivered to me ripped up and i get blamed basically for it and get told I'm basically screwed on getting my money back for a month and a half. I have only had one package come messed up from another place and i contacted customer support and they gave me a choice of getting refunded or i could have the same thing i ordered mailed out that day, to wait on my money for a month and a half is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable especially when it's either Amazon's fault or the delivery company THEY USED to have my order delivered. I guess you guys at Amazon forget that us customers are the ones that keep you employed and for you to treat your customers that spend alot of money with you the way you treated me is beyond crazy. But hey losing around 10-15 prime customers in one day is no sweat for y'all even though one single person is the one that made these 10-15 prime customers leave. So, congrats Amazon keep it up and I'm sure you'll be losing alot more. Hope you enjoy this terrible review on every platform i find showing everyone how you treat people.",0
AMAZON DELIVERY IS TRULY APPALLING. mY ACCOUNT IS NOT CLOSED AND i WILL HAVE NO FURTHER DEALINGS WITH AMAZON LOGISTICS EITHER,0

"Used to absolutely love Amazon prime due to quick and cheaper deliveries and to be able to watch shows and films however lately Amazon prime has started doing advertising on the movies/shows at the beginning and during so I no longer think it’s great  , still acceptable for deliveries but Amazon prime TV is not worth it, you have to pay or subscribe for most of it now and on anything else you now need to watch adverts got a feeling there will be a lot of people like me that will end up cancelling their membership",1
"I'm 50-50 on Amazon. There are sales happening all the time whether it being a small one or a big one. I bought an item from them and it came perfectly well. No blemishes, no defects, works as advertised and great. But the shipment wasn't. Firstly, I was promised 2 day shipment. 2 days later, I checked the status only to realize that it will be delayed till the end of the week. And this isn't the first time too. Amazon really need to work on their shipment consistency.",1
"I like shopping through Amazon but this last interaction might make different choices. Nothing wrong with the purchase process but the shipment really infuriated me. I have 3 doors, front, side and back. Only 2 are used and you can tell side door is never used because sidewalk then street. They had to walk(or drive) by front of house to get house #. Instead of putting it on front porch they placed it on the ground in front of side door, where anyone walking by or driving by would see. Tried to complain at Amazon but there is no where to do it. Amazon needs to hire companies who have better standards for shipment people. Oh the only way that I knew the package was there, shipment person took photo and sent to Amazon, who then emailed me. Package still sat there in plain view for about half an hour. Maybe I should put sign on door - no deliveries at this door please!",1
"whenever i order anything from Amazon, i got that product on time with original guarantee",2
"My account has been hacked!I am a long time user of Amazon. Today someone changed my email address.  I did receive an email about the change from Amazon, 6:18am this morning.  I replied stating I did not authorize any changes.  It is now 3:37pm and I am still awaiting a response.(I also tried to call but the wait is over 1 hour!)  I also sent a message through the website, but also no response.I had to cancel my credit card along with having to update automatic payments. What a mess!",0
"Had a mixed bag of experiences until this year and now nothing goes right. An item you select for that day or next day delivery doesn't turn up or does but it's damaged or missing a whole load of stuff. Amazon, a company that is supposed to make your life that bit easier, has caused me nothing but stress and amped up my anxiety on the past 3 deliveries especially, even missing most of the first day of my first holiday in 8 years. The mental health and mobility awareness is nonexistent. Never using again.",0
"I previously reviewed Amazon for an order that I didn't receive,and was been told that I wouldn't receive a refund or my package. This is what happened. After submitting my review of disappointment in Amazon, I received emails explaining what company of Amazon will honor in my behalf. I received a very nice apology for my loss and did receive my money back. After all of this, Amazon did exhibit a assistance that it was beyond my expectations. For that, I am thankful. However don't take my word for it check it out for yourselves.",1
Amazon manipulates IT'S OWN PRODUCTS reviews!!! But otherwise nice and convenient.,1
"Amazon in Spain uses the worst delivery services in Spain: SEUR. They don't even bother to show up at your door and then pretend that you were absent. Recently, they even pretended that one of my package had been delivered despite having received nothing. A scam.",0
For me 3 stars because I bought the item with acceptable price but I got too much problems with the assistance.,1
"Generally I like to use Amazon to buy online necessities, their customer service however is difficult to navigate when things go wrong with a purchase and sometimes it’s annoyingly unclear whether I’m purchasing from Amazon themselves or a 3rd party outlet but having Amazon Prime is certainly a plus in knowing that generally a purchase is given a clear and free delivery ",2
I believe they are doing so well when it comes to confidentiality. And In most cases I always get exactly what I ordered. Amazon 👏,2
"Anything you needs is basically on Amazon! If you did not receive your item, Amazon will replace or refund you no questions ask! If you need to return a product, you are refunded right away as soon as the item is confirmed in UPS possession! I subscribe to Amazon prime,  and Amazon Unlimited where I listen to the majority of my music. Only thing is the customer service could be better and know more about a company they work for. This is the reason for my 4 star rating! Other than that, Amazon rates a 5 on keeping the products offered affordable.",2
Shocking customer services rude and no understanding whatsoever of my concerns. A real let down after so many years of being a member. They just take your money the service ends there.,0
"I enjoy shopping at Amazon. Have shopped there for years. I recently have purchased a lot of items to replace what was lost in a flood and have been asked to review the items. I am assuming one seller did not like my review because after I wrote it, Amazon has deleted all of my reviews since day 1 and won’t allow me to review anymore. I’ve written them at least 6 times asking them to provide me with the reason why this happened. I’ve gotten no response. It’s been two months. They still want me to rate there order drivers though which I refuse to do now. I’ve spent at least 30 grand in less than 4 months. And they chose to do this over a 20$ item that was horrible.  It’s not as if Amazon is cheaper. It’s a convenient assistance. But if they don’t want real reviews they need to not take any reviews or pay for false reviews imho. This makes me think Amazon is not as up and up as they say they are.",1

"Amazon is always misplacing my packages and their only solution to something I actually needed is to refund my money or replace the item!! What are they even doing to the order people or order assistance?! Recently, USPS, the worst package order assistance in this country was tasked to deliver my air conditioner. Why is beyond me, because even the USPS rep was surprised by this. Amazon customer assistance provided no empathy or solution. I called USPS and they themselves had no idea where the package 📦 was which was both bewildering and upsetting!!! Amazon customer assistance no longer seems to follow-up, so I figure, order people are ripping them off because they know Amazon will just simply replace the item and that somehow everything is supposed to be right in my world?! I'm a pretty honest person, and that just doesn't sit well with me. Especially when it's hot as all get out in my apartment and I expected to have what I ordered on the date that it was shown to delivered. What made matters even worse; all of the accessories arrived on time!!!! ",1

"The local Royal Mail sorting office would be half empty if it wasn't for Amazon's business. But no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list: there is a razor sharp focus in the search engine, but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent.  Sorry guys, but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset, if we ever had a title or author to start with.",1
Amazon is easy to use. I love the convenience. Their app runs smoothly. I can find what I need.,2
"I just reviewed Microsoft, BUT in fairness, I am now going to rate Amazon. Reason: in thinking of the experience, it could be Microsoft that is the issue, or it could be Amazon @ fault. I shop online & use Amazon quite often. When it is time to submit order, make payment selection & where to deliver order to, there are Microsoft discounts offered. BUT to date none of the offered discounts have worked to be applied for a savings. So, it is one of 2 @ fault: Microsoft can be the culprit, or Amazon being the culprit, where discounts can NOT be applied & therefore consumer does NOT get any savings whatsoever! HMMMM makes one wonder: ""False Advertising""? Isn't that against the law?",0
Great as always thank you,2

Excellent. The prime fee is well worth payingFree next day order on many things Free films although I've one one niggle. Not all are free on prime I looked for a film over 20 years old And although I pay for membership they want £5.49 extraI found it elsewhere on DVD for £1.99Ordered it. Now it's mine to keep foreverI never pay their silly prices for film assistance I already pay for,1
"Amazon lost my package. They sent me an email telling me they shipped my package to the wrong place and said we are canceling your order and refunding your money in 3 to 5 days. Why not just fulfill the order and re ship? I called to get more info and they said they can’t because of policy, and I have to reorder. Problem is they won’t refund my money for 3-5 days. I asked them if they could ship it faster, than the free 3-7 day free shipping that was offered, since they lost it and they said no. I understand that the package is coming from a 3rd party vendor, but if they can offer 2day prime shipping for free, than why not 2 day free shipping since they lost it? Customer assistance was very dismissive of my complaint and not at all helpful in getting my package in a timely manner.I also was unable to find a place to add a customer review regarding Amazon. I don’t want to leave a ordinary review for the 3rd party vendor, when it is an Amazon issue.I am sure I will continue to purchase from Amazon, but this shopping interaction did not make me feel very valued.",1
I haven't used this website for shopping for a long time. I often bought things on it when I was in school.,1
The best thing about Amazon is that they basically have everything. I was even able to save us 50%+ on oxygen sensors for our family vehicle and for back to school shopping my wife was able to save almost 75% on school supplies. The only bad thing about Amazon is the reviews section is hard to navigate and filled with mostly unhelpful reviews by people that apparently just want to complain. I've found it helpful to take the review section at basically half value.,2
Been through this place plenty of times and every time I have always gotten my products on time and at a decent price. Love this place!,2
great service and great store i like their sales where you can find anything.,2
Constantly requested reorder of my item and my request was ignored time and time again. My mop arrived 6 days later than planned. Once it came I was very happy with it though so worth the wait.,1
"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Amazon Prime has gone completely ""Woke"". What a shame that my family and I try to watch a good wholesome movie on Amazon Prime and we have to be exposed to ads displaying drag queens. Our triune God says ""vengeance is mine"". Hell is a real place. Repent",0
Amazon you have been amazing throughout this pandemic. Especially throughout this Christmas season. You're agents have been super polite and helpful. Thank you.,2
Consistently exceeds expectations! I order almost everything from Amazon now.. can't recommend highly enough.,2

"I've never been disappointed with a shopping experience on Amazon.  I've ordered, books, music, and clothes seamlessly with fast delivery.",2
"I like the fact Amazon exists, however, I have not had the best of usages with them.  It never ceases to amaze me the number of times I am told that they can not ship to me, even for items previously ordered and delivered.  The pricing structure never makes any sense...it can be competitive one day, outrageous the next day.  I rarely can find how to contact them when I encounter a problem...get tired of going through page after page until they finally 'allow' you access to them.  The only acceptable thing I like about them is that I can use my gift cards from the various survey sites I use.",1
"This book, published in 2019 is a bijou, an incomparable absolute must",2
Always had a fabulous service and refunded if my orders are not available any longer.,2
Prime service is one of the most beautiful things in life,2
"I used to rely on Amazon so much to deliver so fast to me, not I have to order more days ahead, they need to fix their order assistances.",1
Loved the service delivered for my goods!,2
"Amazon use to sell good products now it's full of Chinese company's selling crap,   just like AliExpress except a third of the price",0

"One of the best online shopping company.Its true sometimes there is some delay or misunderstanding. Ex.: Due the wrong delivery they didn't refund amount back on time, but because of inconvenience I got my amount back + compensation (AMAZON COUPON)Good luck!",2
SMALL BUSINESSES BEWARE!!Amazon is not the right place to sell your products unless you get them for free or near and if you can wait a lifetime for your hard earned cash!!!Pay for a decent website and marketing that's the best advice we can give.,0
"Shopping on Amazon has been a mixed bag. The prices are generally good, but the quality of products can be hit or miss. Delivery times are average, and customer service is responsive but sometimes slow. Not bad, but not perfect either.",2
Sweets in the City fantastic service best of all sweets were amazing 👍,2
"I paid for delivery at my address and now i have to pick-up the package at the post location. I try to contact Amazom customer service, but it is impossible. I found no options to reach them. I cant recommend to buy with amazon.com. ",0

Driver didn't bother delivering. Told customer rep who said to give to 10pm and if hadn't arrived would get a full refund. Got message saying attempted delivery. Lies! I have a ring on full settings that's fully working. Driver went home as couldn't be bothered. 4 more reps later and asked to wait longer for £5 as an apology. Said would escalate which I asked them not to as Driver had my address on parcels. No anonymity guarantee and then they were unable to gift the voucher. Said wanted refunded in full. Can't do that either and I'd have to cancel my end. Over an hour with them to give up and go cancel myself. Unable to cancel myself. Insanity! Am so mad at amazon all round. No longer a company to trust. Buyer beware.,0
What is not to like about amazon.  Prices clearly posted. Easy no arguing returns and credit.  Stores old purchases and searches.,2
Very quick speedy delivery service and problems dealt with extremely quickly,2
Awesome👏 ecommerce Platform for all types of products.,2
Great service - any problems they accept no worries,2
"Most of goodss are in fine condition, but a few goodss are fake.Be careful.",1
"In the 2 months I have been an Amazon Prime customer, I have made 11 purchases.  I have had a great interaction with the ordering process.  The issue I have with returns, is trying to make the customer assistance rep understand what I'm telling them.  They repeat back something completely different from what you tell them.  The other issue I have with customer assistance, is that if you ask a question about a goods because the details are a bit confusing, they give you completely incorrect information. It's a shame Amazon doesn't hire competant customer assistance reps, so that their customers don't have such major frustration every time they speak to one.",1
"its a great place to buy, just be carefull choosing the seller.",2
"Used Amazon for more than 10 years. Most of the time, when goodss are sent, things go more or less as planned (often later than forecast order times).But... When something goes wrong, it is challenging to get hold of a human. When we finally reach someone, they do not have time and give you the runaround. Basically, whenever you need real support, there is none.For example (latest to date): ordered 10 automation devices. 2 were delivered. The last 8 to expect on 10-Aug. It is now 27-Aug and still no update. Finally reached someone and after lots of chatting, the staff stated ""It is stuck"" (no more explanation). ""You will get an e-mail when it is released..."" Unable to cancel the order either. So if I order again, I might end up with double the quantity one day.There are more examples. In each case, it took months to resolve.",1
Amazon is quick and easy shopping with a lot of items for sale except liquor and smokes.,2
i use them all the time and have had no problems with any of the items bought and all have arrived on time if not early,2
"As a prime member, I have been using Amazon services in India and overseas for a long time. But the recent incident made me rethink regarding availing the services again. Recently, during my vacation in Noida India, I requested a refund for my order. Consequently, there was a pick up of the delivered product, but the pick man was very rude and acted like a local goon. He came 2 times for pickup. On the first visit, he misguided me and told me that the product he had come to pick up was of a different color by showing one of the different color product pictures. The second time, when I asked him why he misguided me, he became quite rude and started abusing me in front of my house and was not ready to leave the property despite repeated instructions by me to leave the property. I have CCTV footage regarding the incident. I hope Amazon will take steps accordingly as the only automated reply I got from their customer service and the head team is that 'you are our precious customer and they will take strong action against the pickup agent', but until now there has been no action and when I asked them about the status they told me that it is an internal matter which shows how serious they are regarding the incident and don't care about the customer. I am planning to go legal and also posting the CCTV footage on the internet to aware the other customers regarding this rowdy pick up agent.",0
"I correct the review not for the object but for the seriousness of the seller, given the return problems (stuck in customs also due to Amazon's poor information even after insistent requests on how to proceed with the return) for the contents of the batteries, the Even if the seller didn't receive the item back, he still refunded me.______________________________________Brickhouse Security Camscura doesn't work with win 10 or with win xp you can't change the settings in particular the date.I started the return but there were problems due to the dangerous content of the batteries and it is therefore stopped in customs, I asked the amazon assistance service several times about the return methods but they were not able to provide me with correct information, the amazon assistance service has always provided different indications at first also not to return the item which would have been refunded anyway, so I find myself without the item I spent money to return it and I am not refunded due to incompetence on the part of amazon customer service they were wrong with the various and different misdirections and now i have to pay. If the amazon managers are able to see this review, I invite you to verify the skills of your operators.",2
Amazon is not what it used to be.. it’s a chore to use them and a stressful experience!,0
"For years I've used them and It's really easy for consumers and sellers/scammers to use and often they don't issue refunds, hint's how the owner became richest person so proceed with caution.",1
Dont get me wrong I like Amazon. Sometimes there is great deals on there and I love the one click payment option. But there are times that you search for something and it is presented in such a confusing way you are never actually sure how much your paying for someting and the search function is a bit weak at points.,1
I can’t take this company seriously. Bezos has nearly one trillion dollars and can’t find it in himself to meet the very reasonable demands of striking workers.I cancelled my subscription recently and will not be giving a single penny to this hoarder until I know for a fact that it will end up in the pockets of the workers.,0
Never had any issues amazon prime fine for.next day order not really using amazon as much as i used to as i feel there prices are getting quite expensive used to use them for my tropical fish filter sponge and stones but its an add on item now meaning i have to spend something like £20 to get something at £3 meaning i now have to travel 25 miles to our nearest wilko for them. The pantry also a rip off order dearer than actual items.,1
Really requires patience to wait for the item to arrive at your doorstep!,1
"I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer assistance numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer assistance saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a decent way to treat their loyal customers.",1
Horrible experience I purchased a water jug and two 4lbs bags of mango candy’s typed in my debit card info and I was never charged for it and they emailed me hey you need to pay or we won’t ship it well it’s your fault because you never charged me for it I’m sticking with eBay and I’m forever shipping with ups,0
"Amazon as a whole is an ok company. Each time I deal with a customer representative I am satisfied with the results however, this new order system they have is faulty. I order and pay money to have a support that guarantees a order but because they hire self employed lazy drivers I dont get my stuff as promised. I dont mind waiting, if that's what the item I am buying states but if it says it will be here on a Tuesday then I expect it to be here on a Tuesday. I pay 100+ a year to have this support. 4 stops and 5 miles away from my home the driver decides to mark the package with ""attempted"" order. I called Amazon and filed a report and they could see the driver was no where near my residence at time of ""attempted"" scan. If you take on a job, do it, or you shouldn't get paid. This kind of misuse of Amazon's time and customer complaints will eventually end up in the consumer pocket since Amazon will lose money hiring lazy drivers.",1
A decent site but have had my card details hacked into twice!,1
I have to say amazon did a acceptable job in retuning an items.I can see are not perfect..but this time they did well. Fruugo in the other hand never did.,1
"I only discovered Amazon last year, and I certainly feel like I've been missing out! Since, I order from Amazon almost every week.The best prices on the web, great support and extremely fast shipping options makes for a brilliant user experience. Would highly recommend!",2
"Sadly, Amazon Prime is no longer Prime! My last 4 orders have not been delivered on time. It seems the Phonex facility doesn't care about On Time Deliveries. Plus they have a average habit of losing packages. I know that Phonex is only 1.5 hours from Tucson and I know they make several stops along the way, but, if it takes a driver over 12 hours to make his trip, you need new drivers!",1
Amazon Europe is slow with incredibly long waiting times.,1
Excellent. The prime fee is well worth payingFree next day order on many things Free films although I've one one niggle. Not all are free on prime I looked for a film over 20 years old And although I pay for membership they want £5.49 extraI found it elsewhere on DVD for £1.99Ordered it. Now it's mine to keep foreverI never pay their silly prices for film assistance I already pay for,1
"There is always something wrong with Amazon.Starting from out of date food shipment, subscriptions with rising prices with every shipment.Ending on a useless document verification system, which is unable to verify documents accepted by ANY OTHER BRITISH company.That's why I quit my Prime membership after 6 years.",1

"I'm from Iran and as all the world know there is bad story between IR and US (course governments not people)So i tried to buy some original clothes or shoes etc.tried to find a way for this.found too many IR websites which sell Amazon Gift Cards.this is not same with fake gift cards or something like that.cards are all legal and Amazon took its money for them.so i earned 3X50$ gift cards.and redeemed them for my account.worked without problem.and for deliver problem i asked my friend to use his address in Croatia and take delivery my things and send to me.before buying i talked to amazon's operators at chat and explained all story about cards and address and asked them inform me if there is any problem or not.i'll take my order or not?and they said yes sure.there is nothing bad with your country and your friend's address.go order anything u like no worries.I did.bought a Nike sneakers and my shopping confirmed by Amazon.but next day they sent an email and said your order canceled due some regional problems.i got disappointed but after opening my acc i just got amazed.order was canceled ok but where is my Gift cards that u confirmed them?its 2 years that i ask them bring my cards back and they dont.the worst un-respecting act is where that they dont say we wont bring them.they say u are right but nothing happens.each time i talk the help operator says OMG this is not good.dont worry ill fix this.u should take your cards back we are really sorry for this.promise u get them tomorrow.But seems its still today there cuz i never seen their tomorrow after 2 years.and each time ask again i have to explain all story again and im getting exactly same lies: OMG dont worry it gonna fix until tomorrow!!!I paid for those Gift Cards.150$ was my salary for 2 months. 1$ was 50000 Rials that time and now 1$=150,000 Rials.whats my fault?i im a simple guy who wanted buy a pair of shoes.why u dont give my money back?i worked hard for thatAny other name for this? whats this if its not robbing or stealing or lying?",0

"Good pricing, acceptable items, but when they mess up, they mess up average with little to no compensation.I’ve bought from Amazon many times.  When their customer assistance agents say someone will get back to you, know that they will never get back to you.  Have heard that at least a dozen separate times and never once has anyone got back to me.They can usually correct things pretty quick, but the problems thst get them there are usually pretty average and they do nothing or very little to mitigate the issue.Overall I still buy from them because of the pricing but I am starting to slow down on purchases because their poor resolution on multiple problems has had me spend way too much time on the phone with them correcting their mistakes while I am actually paying to correct them for them, by being a customer.I have also caught them in their own policy lies and have it recorded where the agent refuses to put in writing what he says on the phone, even though he will put other things in writing.  I asked him directly; why will you say it on the phone to me and not put it in writing, he said because he isn’t obligated to do that.  Unbelievable.I think this company is dealing with the massive influx of sales during the pandemic and though I have little sympathy for the trillions in profit... overall they do pretty acceptable job... when they mess up it can be pretty average... but usually they don’t mess up and usually things will sort out.  I wish I could more easily support Canadian retailers though.",1

"Since Amazon has gone to its own shipping, the shipping has become unreliable. I recently ordered three cases of copy paper at the same time, same order--one came one day, a second came the next, and the third never came and Amazon told me it had been returned. How can three packages, ordered at one time, each find a different path (or not) to the purchaser? With other order, packages have been dropped off at neighbor's houses and then shown on the Amazon website as being 'delivered'. Clearly Amazon should not be in the shipping business. And for the privilege of this Amazon ""assistance"" the company has increased its membership fees substantially. I am frankly looking at alternate suppliers.",1
"First they messed up my gift card (simply disappeared from my account) - customer service unimaginably bad. They didn't even understand the problem, when they realise they can't help a new person tries to assist me and I have to explain everything again and again and again without anything going forward. Finally, when someone saw that I didn't spend but received the amount, and admits that it disappeared, compensation is still not an option :D. They don't have the authority I suppose.Then few weeks later I can't even log in :D. I don't get the security notification to my phone, whereas my number is correct (confirmed with customer service). Customer service then tries to authenticate me on phone, which is unsuccessful, because I don't remember the last 3 books I bought (I don't even remember buying anything from amazon, I have this account for ~10 years and I barely use it for shopping).So now I can't log in to audible either, which I have a subscription for. And this was again many hours of my life instead of them just implementing other ways to authenticate (email, secondary phone number, push notification, I don't know man, something, it is the 21st century!)Overall, I am shocked that customer complaints worth nothing for them, there is no interface to escalate problems and that they have been able to build a disfunctioning bureaucracy in capitalism and they are not yet falling apart.",0
I hope you guys can improve the order and the customer support; more people need it for their wrong or damaged purchases.,1

Amazon employ thiefs to deliver their items! I have no choice but to stop using their services now as most of the parcels these days never arrive!

Dispicable! Reported several times to them but nothing ever changes.,0
"I have been a loyal Amazon customer for years. It used to be great and I loved it, I still do but there are more and more disappointments with almost every other order, it is going down the hill: it is already a norm for the packages to get lost, not to arrive on time, customer support is usually useless and not professional. I used to do most of my shopping through Amazon but I am trying to avoid ordering on Amazon now, I hope they will get it under control.",1

I use amazon like most however don't display same day shipment if order by such a time if when ordered in that time you have no intention too than add 2 or 3 days for shipment.  Boxes still take the Michael waste of space half the time small items in huge boxes.,1
Terrible customer service. Do not order to Thailand. Ordered 3 months ago and still waiting. Asked for refund. Still waiting.,0
"Overall acceptable site. Delivers when they say. The only issue I have is my card was replaced while in a trial of prime that was 1.99. When I went to update it, they didn't even let me finish my week of prime (I was only 3 days in) and they charged me 14.99 right away. So I paid 16.99 for a month in reality and customer support said because I used it. (Um like people do with a PAID trial) I was just basically out of that money. So I'll order again but never will I ever use prime again.",1

Amazon has been good to me so far. I have heard a few things here and there from other people but those were mostly with people dealing with actually selling on Amazon. So far so good. If their stock goes up more I will reward them with 5 stars. LoL ;) Come on Amazon.com! YOU GOT THIS,2
Cannot rely on Amazon for delivery anymore. They advertise a buy it now and get the item by a certain day. This NEVER happens anymore and they blame the seller or the delivery. Amazon has gone downhill and is has lost me as a customer.,0

"Amazon Prime is away ahead of the game as a media and commodity provider and in the latter very fine at sourcing unusual or hard to come by items that you may need from time to time! And their customer support on Prime items is second to none. However, here’s the but - don’t trust Amazon reviews for their associated/affiliated sellers as they are largely hogwash - this view is attested by several leading consumer related bodies. If buying an item via Amazon from one of these guys make sure you double check independent reviews on them. And don’t bother posting critical reviews on these sellers as Amazon will usually block them.",1
Been a prime user for about 3 years. Use to be really acceptable. Even use to get same day shipment. Now shipment’s are 2-4 days,1
"Overall amazon is a very solid company and selling online market. It’s not flawless and the are clear and obvious flaws. However take away those flaws and you get a very solid and reasonable company. Lots of availability. Great goodss but sometimes lets me down with the shipment.

It’s a great company with great resources that provide fast, efficient online shopping usage.",1
"It started out as a once in awhile issue but now it's every time I order from them and now I'm just done ordering from them. Screw me over every chance they got. Right now the thing I am most angry about is the $700 I paid for my HP360 laptop.  If you don't know what a 360 is   It's one of the laptops that folds all the way backward and can become a tablet. I bought it last August. When UPS delivered it, the box was partially opened and it loomed beat up. I wasn't even home to use it for about 3 months and I've used it a grand total of about 6 times!  It's gotten worse and worse every time I've gone to use it and this morning I try to use it - and NOTHING!  Nothing at all. Not a dam thing! It won't even load. I can't open a single ap and im freaking out. So I guess I'm going to call Amazon, tho I don't know why.  Whoever answers the phone will barely speak English I won't be able to understand them and vice versa. Then they'll tell me what I already know because I just looked it up on my phone and I tried to post a bad review on Amazon -  They're not even selling that computer anymore they won't allow me to post a review at all when I try to it brings me to my other orders instead and it says it's past the return and customer help date.  So something tells me I bought a lemon and THEY KNOW IT! I need this computer.  And I was so happy when I got it. It's red, my favorite color. It's just what I wanted...we work hard for our money just for them to steal it from us. I don't hate a lot but I really hate Amazon.",0

These kinds of things are happening far too often. Packages going missing, running extremely late, and/or arriving empty. It's getting old.

Prices are getting higher compared to a few years ago.Shipping seems to have gotten faster though,1
The only shopping service i use... always the best option,2
"It used to be that if I purchase more than $35, it usually was Free Shipping.  Last few times I tried, it's a struggle to get to checkout and find that if I select the Free Shipping option, it automatically signs me up for Prime membership, even though I did not select that option earlier in checkout. I know it's able to be cancelled. But everything selectable towards Checkout doesn't inform me that the Trial Membership WILL be added, just that my purchase will qualify if I exceed $35.  I've never had to deal with that in the past and now never know what might have changed from order to order and need to proceed with caution.  So my complaint to Amazon is why do you make simple things so complicated?  So I find myself shopping for the same items at Walmart.com.  Update: I went to Walmart.com after this review and found the item. Originally, I had several things in Amazon Cart to exceed $35.  The one item I originally was looking for was only only $7 on Walmart and still got a speedy FREE SHIPPING checkout process.  HAPPY AGAIN.And now as I look back at the shipping details, it seems now the $35 is $58 to qualify, but most all the things I was shopping for still tout $35 to qualify. Too complicated.",1

Great company. It is really easy to purchase products on Amazon and never had an issue with returns. Prices are decent (though not necessarily the cheapest). I can think of two cons: I think if I would shop around I would find cheaper prices on some items  on Walmart or Target and I also hate the recent price hikes on Prime. Other than that I am happy the general service.,2
Cant fault them. When you got a problem with a company. Amazon sort it out without any problems. ,2

"Amazon now is making a habit of notifying customers that their order has been delivered, when in fact, it was not delivered. And when you call to ask why, I am told that many times the system will mark a package delivered when it was not delivered. I have to wait 24 hours, and if I still do not find the package, I can claim I never received it. Amazon used to brag about being ""customer eccentric"", now I understand why I'm not seeing that anymore.",0
Beware Canadian I’ve been customer for almost 10 years now. Had an incident where I ordered 3 same items I received 2 the right item the third had the label on one side of the item I ordered but the upper had different item which contains something that I didn’t even ordered. Called customer service explained the issue and they told me I need to return the item request a refund and ordered again which I did. Now I received an email from Amazon that I haven’t returned the correct item and they will charge me for it. Really this is becoming theft by corporation on consumers. Ontario issued consumer beware list on Amazon.caIt’s time to drop Amazon and go back to our old habits of shopping. on my end I cancelled Prime membership and requested a delete of my account. The trust went from 100 to zero.I also will be placing a complaint to Quebec consumer protection bureau as this is unacceptable for any business.,0
"I purchased a dive watch from Amazon on 8/29/23. The item came on time. However, it was defective. So, rather than get a refund, I ordered a replacement on 9/2/23. The package was supposed to arrive in two to three days. I am still waiting for the item. It is now almost 9/18. I am a Prime customer, and have spent quite a lot of money with them over the years. I've called their customer support numerous times. I keep getting the same scripted answers. Sounds like a run-around to me. The item is in transit, they keep repeating. When I checked the USPS tracking history, the last date is 14 days ago, on 9/4/23, stating awaiting receipt of item. In other words, the Post Office hasn't even received the package. Even Amazon's own website says the package may be lost, and to request a refund or replacement. I was told to call back on 9/20 for them to investigate further. That's 18 days since I ordered the item. What a joke. I barely can understand these reps over the phone. Sound familiar? This is the last time I will ever order a big-ticket item from them. Before, Amazon promptly refunded me or sent out a replacement right away. This is how you lose loyal customers!Post Script (9/26/23): I was finally issued a refund,18 days after I purchased the watch. The item never arrived, nor did the USPS ever receive my package. I got an email from their customer support saying that the package was deemed 'not deliverable' and sent back to an Amazon facility. Just what I was telling them all along. As a Prime customer, I should not have to wait nearly three weeks. Amazon could have sent me a replacement. Again, this is not a acceptable way to treat their loyal customers.",1
"Whilst Amazon are good for a quick delivery,  I found that some of the delivery drivers couldn't care if you get your package or not. My last order was left outside for anyone to come along and take it. They didn't even ring my doorbell.",0

"I was shocked! You aren’t able to write a negative review on purchases.  I had trouble with a purchase and titled my review...”buy at your own risk”.  I said that “I ordered an item the 1st part of July and after 3 weeks I contacted the seller to say it hadn’t been received and was told it was shipped, but never got any other communication  from the seller after that.”  Amazon said I couldn’t post a review like that.  I thought that’s what the review was for.  Ultimately I did receive the item after another couple of weeks. Don’t trust all the reviews, because amazon isn’t letting the negative ones be posted.",1
"I placed an order, Amazon provided the wrong tracking number, or the seller provided the wrong tracking number to them. It was delivered to another state, and I know it was not my item because it was described by USPS as a small packet item delivered to mailbox, my item was a treadmill which would not be a small packet that could be delivered in a mailbox.I tried contacting the seller and with no success. I looked for a way to contact Amazon to tell them that contrary to showing the item was delivered, it was not delivered and that I was getting no satisfaction from the seller, I looked everywhere on Amazon, there is NO customer service to contact for such issues - nothing at all. I finally had to contact the bank to dispute the charge because there was no way for me to get any assistance from Amazon.",0
"At first, I really loved using Amazon.  Their two-day order was spot on, and I could order anything and trust the goods.  Now, it feels like I’m always trying to check with myself as to why I’m paying this membership!  Two-day order is bs.  I’ve had several two-day order packages be delayed.  One was a birthday present for my 6 year old nephew.  We postponed leaving until the next morning because Amazon said the order would be there in two days.  Right at the 9pm end of day order mark, Amazon sends a shipment delay note saying it may not be for another 5 days.  The tracking showed it was in my city.  Why would that take 5 days?!  Im beginning to wonder what I pay this membership for.  The two day shipping has gone to the wayside, and I’m beginning to not believe in Amazon’s promise any more...or the quality of the goodss sold.  Don’t say you can do something if you can’t.  False advertising, Amazon.  Maybe I should take my membership to Walmart, Amazon.  What do you think about that?  I’m not a fan, but they seem to be getting themselves squared away to be completion.",1

"Many people to talk to, but no one who can really help your issue. They all just tell you the same thing. My personal card was charged on my company's business account for Prime. So I called in and the rep told me he would refund my card and give me prime for free for the next year. Sounds nice, right? Next thing I know, the prime membership on the company is canceled! I call in and they say the rep promised me something they can't fulfill (she will send a message to his manager to make sure he knows this for the future.. gee thanks) and he also canceled my membership, but ""no worries"" you can just sign up again on the sign up page. So about the promise, I argued with the rep saying a company such as Amazon should stand behind what their reps, even if the rep made a mistake. We had it out for a few minutes until she said she can offer me a partial promotional credit to my account for compensation. It was almost the full amount so I consented. About the continued membership, ""no worries, just sign up from your end because we can't do it from our end."" Oh, but when I go to the sign up page, the price for business prime is now $179 and we were paying $119! Even after emailing and complaining that I got into this mess from a rep that made a average mistake, it's not my fault that my membership was cancelled and if it hadn't been I would be still paying the lower rate, every rep who emails me just tells me the same thing: Our terms changed and we ""offer Business Prime Memberships for Business Account where the customers can simply make purchases and avail two-day free shipping. This completely for a free shipping purpose and the other benefits of prime will not be given."" Sounds like it should be cheaper, right? $60 more than standard prime for personal accounts. Not getting anywhere with Amazon and very frustrated with ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company.""**After calling back and asking to speak with a manager, I was able to sign up again for the business prime and he will refund me for the difference of $60 this one time. He said as of next year standard prime will no longer be available for business accounts so then I will have to make my decision but for now, he gave me the lower rate for Business prime. Now we're talking sense. Thank God for managers",1
being a prime customer doesn't work 80% of the times! paying the prime membership for nothing...i gave up on buying certain items from amazon because they never come on time.,1
"We were expecting a package to be delivered today an while we were sitting in our living room we get a text saying they could not leave our package because they could not access our front door. AN ABSOLUTE LIE! When we contacted Amazon they put us in contact with the vendor who said they didn't have sufficient delivery information (same delivery address all our packages arrive with...our home address) ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER LIE! When we asked what time they might be back today they said they weren't delivering it today. We spoke to several individuals at Amazon, including supervisors and not one of those individuals would give us the time of day. We used Amazon for several orders and this is the first time we felt we were being lied to and brushed off. I have no interest in ordering from them ever again. I HAVE NO INTEREST IN DEALING WITH A COMPANY WHOS EMPLOYEES ARE TAUGHT TO LIE TO THE CONSUMER",0

"I used your website for years and literally spent over $10,000. I can no longer support a website that doesn't value freedom, and quite literally inserts itself to make a political statement against a difference of opinion. I cancelled my Prime, and will shop else where. I'm not American but if this is allowed to stand it means more censorship going forward that you have no right to control. You are a online seller not a political party, or a party who gets to dictate free speech. I hope it was worth losing customers over.",0
My favorite company. My challenge is that they are holding my over $200 of gift card. They said the card is invalid. How can a card I bought be invalid after using some part of it?,1

"Amazon is going downhill.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to ""dump Amazon Prime"" like others suggest.  I'm simply going to deal with them cautiously.My first complaint is their search algorithm.  Last night, I was looking for watches.  Amazon's initial search returned over 10,000 results.  I didn't want to wade through 10,000 result so I decided to change the sort from [Default] to [Price Low to High].  I didn't narrow the search in ANY way.  The new results dropped to 100.  I literally lost over 9,900 purchase options.  I was forced to go back to the previous search results and wade through a ton of crap that was of no interest to me.  It literally too me a half hour to find a Timex watch that should have shown up on the low end of prices when I changed the sort order but it was eliminated in those results.  What the hell is that???My next complaint is that they've changed their ""Two Day Shipping"" policy.  I understand that this change occurred some time ago but the point is that you have to pay attention to WHEN the item ships.  Two days is no longer calculated from the date of order but from the date of ship.  In some cases, shipping won't occur for a couple of weeks!My third complaint is that their customer assistance used to be automatic.  They would take responsibility when things went wrong and they'd offer a resolution without even being asked.  Today, getting Amazon to take responsibility for broken promises is like pulling teeth.  I used to give them 5 stars for customer assistance but today, I'd be hard pressed to give them anything more than 2.5.Bottom line.  Amazon is no longer the go-to for me and I shop around before placing ANY orders there.  Besides finding better pricing in other places, there are many browser add-ons and apps that offer me additional savings or money back on my purchases with other retailers.  I would have given them 2 stars but I do get some use out of the included streaming benefit.",1

"If you are EBT you get 50% off Amazon Prime. If you have updated your debit card or bank card from when you first signed up you'll be in trouble if you need a refund like me. I had to update my debit card and needed a refund from Amazon. Guess what? They sent the refund to the original card when you signed up.  That was three bank cards ago. I explained I have an updated bank card and they didn't want to help. I spoke to a supervisor who said ""contact the bank and ask where the refund is.""  I said to Amazon, which bank card last 4 digits did the refund go to so I can tell the bank to check my older bank cards. Amazon did not want to disclose that information. I had to call 4 times, the first 3 times I got put on hold and they hung up on me after 10-15 minutes. The Virtual Chat was better help than talking with a live person.  Poor customer service!",0
"I'm a little 50/50 with Amazon, items are great, you can find great prices in the marketplaces. But when I deal with items directly from Amazon, I find their supports lacking. I've saved something in my basket for a week now, waiting to purchase it. Today I noticed that it had double in price, but was still 49% off RRP? I don't understand that.",1
"I am a professional shopper. I shop for people as, well as for my family.  Since I am a Prime Member, I get free 2-day shipping, as well as Sunday deliveries!!

I always have to sift through and find real pictures of the item that ends up looking like it's from Alibaba or some knock off company. Those are low standards to follow!",1

"Amazon has a vast selection of products at great prices and is very easy to navigate. The one click option is great.  My only reservation is the seller rating system as one seller offered me money to remove a critical review, which left me doubting the overall validity of the rating system. I informed Amazon by email but had no reply.",2
"I love the convenience of ordering online, however the order system for this company fails in many ways by having ""lazy"" order individuals deliver the items. I have had items wet, muddy, run over, and simply lost in a place not visible to retrieve them. This is an ongoing problem with Amazon. They need their own trucks and driver to eliminate this problem.",1
"They make political stances thinking they know what best for my interests. They can't seem to get my delivery days correct, I know people who work for Amazon and they get treated like crap. They treat their deliver service providers like crap. I know a few. I don't think they realize that they are customers as well. But they wouldn't care anyways. When you have an issue, there's nobody who cares to help you.",0
"I have only admiration for them, as with Google, I'd never heard of Amazon until 13 years ago! I can see why they have done well. I have had no issue ordering from them. There service is spot on, quick, the packaging is good. Some prices could be cheaper, but that is splitting hairs!",2

They were not nice at all and after 5' of conversation did not seem to care. We had to send photos and we are awaiting their answer within 3 days. This is theft. It can only have taken place in their warehouse or while it was delivered but...someone somewhere must have known what was in the package - which means access to Personal Data! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING EXPENSIVE.NEW SCAM - DO NOT ORDER iPHONE or anything expensive - Warehouse or delivery THEFT!",0

I asked about this but courier person told me that I’ll get it from another courier representative.At evening second courier person came to give me my shoe but he denied to give it without replacement shoe, which I was already given to another Amazon courier person at afternoon.From 21st Nov., I had called 11 times to Amazon customer care about my issue and asked about my replacement product but, not got any answer from Amazon customer service.I have provided pick up tracking also but it is not working.

"Please stop collaborating with Airmee in Sweden. They never deliver on time, and whenever I ordered a item from Amazon, I end up with local order with Airmee without my consent.

"Usually my amazon deliveries are great, but only when I deliver to my mother's home as they always put my parcel behind the wheelie bin if no one is home or just in general preferred space even if I'm home and they take a photo to let me know. However, when ordering, make sure to check what area you live in cause some areas are prone to either stealing your parcels if its small. I ordered 2 mascaras recently and it was suppose to come Thursday and suddenly I get a notification it's delivered today and left in the letterbox when it was not there at all, so disappointed, I'm never going to order to my apartament as my parcels are always never delivered, only if they're large parcels then they arrive as I'm shown tracking, and it arrives to me as I wait downstairs, also depends who delivers it, but when it comes to small packages it's always a problem, I'm awaiting a refund and re delivered same item to new address. Plus I didn't get a tracking map this time for this one  the order just flew out of nowhere, it kept saying delivering tomorrow then today and just switching up.",1
Good for the most part but customer assistance can be completely hopeless to absolutely wonderfulJust hope you get the right end of the stick if the rare occasion arises you have a problem with an amazon item or 3rd party seller,1
"In the last 30 days i have ordered 15 items from amazon. 1 arrived on time. We pay for prime. Everything i order is sold and shipped by amazon, i dont deal with secondary sellers. So when theu tell me...3-8hr delivery, next day, 2 day, etc...i expect that they should meet that deadline. I am in a huge city and we have 3 amazon warehouses near me. When they advertise a time for something to be delivered youd expect that its for items in their local reach. We have multiple drivers (many) go through our neighborhood all day long. Amazon lies. Charge me 150 for prime and for what? Im done with them. At least Walmart gets me my items in 2 days and i dont have to pay for a membership. Amazon has become a joke.",0

Hello my name is mike green I am contacting you because I have been dealing with multiple issues at my amazon facility in am currently a level 1 employee at las 1 henderson nv.I am a very motivated associate who is eager to learn and grow in this company.I have spoken to many floor managers that I would like to be enrolled into any and all trainings/classes that would help me advance my career. My managers tell me they submit my tickets I check in with learning and nothing ever seems to exsist on my behalf. I am one of the most efficent and hard working employees in las 1 dock receive. I always take the initiative to do what needs to be done without being told I drop whatever im doing  instantly when a manager needs me to do something. And yet employees that do not work near as hard as I do get enrolled in classes and receive promotions to pg or pa. I was told hard workers in this company have many chances and ways to advance but I have not been given any opportunity.I have discussed all of this with multiple ops managers floor managers pg's and pa's yet nothing is ever done.I have worked so well in one days I recieved a total of 13 raffles for my work performance and yet I still do not get recognized for any of my additional trainings I have even helped a training ambassadors train a class and employees but cant get my self trained or certified i would really love to be trained and certified in every department here at las 1 if possible.Patrice was one of my trainers and senior managers that motivated me with her story of her story and  advancements in the company when I heard her speak in knew I wanted to follow in her footsteps but my management team is not helping with these cituations at all some of these managers tell me thank you mike your making our job easier or they say mike can you slow down your making some of us look average or work a little harder.Just recently I helped my team hit record on out shift that we have never ever hit before. So please if there is anything you could do it would be highly appreciated.,1
"Excellent selection of items from clothing to houshold goods. Fast delivery; some items come from overseas, but most items can arrive with a same day or overnite delivery.

"I have been a Prime member since 2016. In the years, the service has increased in price. Something else I noticed since lockdown: I can find most items I buy on Amazon cheaper elsewhere even when I include shipping. The only advantage Prime has is the speed of delivery (most of the time I can get it next day) pretty soon, it won’t be worth it: Disappointed. ",0
"I have purchased many large and small items from Amazon including a 37"" HD TV and an excellent one too especially the price. Good reliable company, I have never had a problem at all.",2
"Let's get to the point, Amazon have some issues. Firstly there is a lot of low quality third party sellers on the site. It's getting very difficult to find quality and avoid the trash. So much so that it's not a place to make a lot of big purchases when you can go to more selective companies that don't just rack and stack.Second, their delivery guys will do anything to record a completed delivery. Leaving boxes over the fence, in the rain and when it's a fragile item. Not a good idea. The bad is easily outweighed by the good though. Returns are a breeze, delivery is nearly always on time, even around the holiday season.  On the few occasions I have had to contact a real person they have been quick to respond and very good at solving the problem. I think Amazon have shown that they super successful by being slightly better than the competition, most who set a very low bar. So a long way from perfect but still an easy recommend",2

"I purchased a pair of heels and what I received was nothing like I ordered. When I tried to return them, the seller said ""I hope that I like my order and to write a review."" I sent them a picture of what I was shipped and what I ordered so they could see the egregious mistake. They said they do not offer returns. I made a complaint to Amazon and they said I had to pay for shipping. The shipping cost more than the shoes did and while I received the shoes from Bakersfield, CA I had to ship them back to China to some random warehouse. NEVER AGAIN!",0

I'm out nearly £50 still as they ask for a receipt of return. You have the tracking and the image of it delivered at their warehouse. Edit, it took nearly a month, but got a refund in the end.Has really not encouraged me to use them again.",0
Ordered something on prime for delivery yesterday. Said it would delivered by 10pm and was on the phone to customer service who might I add are very rude and spoke to me like I was stupid.

No problem I can apply it to a shirt.So I posted my review for it and Amazon messaged me saying they couldn't post my review... I posted that it was a Decal not a shirt.

Not allowed to leave bad reviews they get removed ALL of them even if they date back 8 years! Apperently ur not allowed to leave bad reviewd its biased haha yeah nice one! Customer service are morons and seem to all be slow speaking mongs that dont know anything. All the stuff on amazon is cheap and nasty anyway. The daily deals are so bad all junk and unpronouncable stupid moody chinese makes. Go on the todays deals and find a make u can say let alone heard of! Amazon is a disaster.

Everything i bought from amazin dies after a few months anyway,0
"Really good value for money, not just free next day delivery but all the prime features. ",2
Driver didn't bother delivering. Told customer rep who said to give to 10pm and if hadn't arrived would get a full refund. Got message saying attempted delivery. Lies! I have a ring on full settings that's fully working. Driver went home as couldn't be bothered. 4 more reps later and asked to wait longer for £5 as an apology. Said would escalate which I asked them not to as Driver had my address on parcels. No anonymity guarantee and then they were unable to gift the voucher. Said wanted refunded in full. Can't do that either and I'd have to cancel my end. Over an hour with them to give up and go cancel myself. Unable to cancel myself. Insanity! Am so mad at amazon all round. No longer a company to trust. Buyer beware.,0
"Amazon’s persistent push for Prime, even with free postage from the seller, adds an extra layer of scrutiny to the checkout process. To enhance my review, Amazon could improve by toning down the relentless Prime prompts.  As for the included movies included with prime, these are usually low budget productions not even worth watching.",0
"Amazon is truly amazing. I am a long time customer and recently I ordered a down alternative comforter and it was delivered, However I made a mistake or someone in the house did and I could not locate the package.  I called Amazon and I told them that I did not receive my package. They issued a refund . I subsequently found my package and I called Amazon back and asked them to cancel the refund . They told me they had no way of canceling the refund, and I did not have to return the item, and I could keep my comforter as a happy holiday gift from Amazon. Now, that's what I call EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE! TY AMAZON!",2
Placed my orders and had them delivered the next day with a free trial of Prime. Regular user and no complaints so far.,2
Very fast shipping!,2
Always buy everything on Amazon.,2
"What can I say?  Amazon does everything as perfectly as humanly possible.  Prime is great, and if you do a lot of online shopping you should definitely sign up.  To be able to get almost anything within 2 days with free shipping is amazing.  I hate going to stores (I am male after all), and the cheap prices aside for most things waiting 2 days is just as good as getting it right now.  And the extra benefits of free Prime videos and shows, music, etc. make it a no brainer.I have never had something go wrong that, as long as I contacted them reasonably close to the purchase date they have not gone out of their way to make right.Most of the third party sellers are reputable.  I have had some disappointments with shoddy products that did not show up for some time with them.  But those have been rare.Amazon is definitely, to me, the gold standard for online retail.  Given their success I am sure I am not alone.Also, I have their FireTV which makes any cable box look like a piece of garbage.   I would definitely recommend it as well.  It goes great with Prime videos, Netflix and any online streaming that you would watch on your TV itself (which is how I want to watch my content).",2
I guess I like their variety of options. But sometimes I tend to recieve goodss with so-so quality,1
"The amazon is a good app to buy the products through on-line. I recently buy a mobile charger (oppo) and I got the delivery after the 5 days. it's quite ok. And the main surprise for me is i got the Samsung charger. i put it on replacement the amazon was taken more then two weeks to change my charger. it is the main problem faced by me, not only me there are many people who are facing with different issues like wrong delivers, address, product etc.",2
I think it's very convenient. I think it has the largest number of product listings in the world. The only thing that would make it better is if the shipping costs were lower.,2
very disappointed with service that is so bad.,0
I love to buy amazon because they have the fastest shipping. Free amazon prime for students I use to ship all my stuff. I recently needed to get a lacrosse ball for practice and I got it so fast. Thank you amazon,2
Amazon customer service agent threatened to murder my family. Refused to give me a refund and called me a liar.,0

"Start your free trial, they say.  Then you click the button and you immediately pay $7.49/month.  So misleading.  Such a disaster of a company; for employees, for the earth, for small honest reasonable businesses.",0
Good one... Products are acceptable,1
"Great choice, delivery as expected .... happy as!",2
Amazon double charges customers!!!! They are a bunch of thieves.,0
Can't fault Amazon too much normally pretty fine but they really do need to sort out their third party order  drivers leaving people's parcels outside for all to see and saying handed to resident when they don't even knock the door cheers for soaking  my son's Christmas!!,1
