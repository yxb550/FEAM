it was worth the wait .,2
its great if you spent the day there and did n ' t want to drive to eat .,2

my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger .,0
"my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler . . . a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray ' s fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .",2

the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu .,1
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint .,0
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for .,2
the pancakes should be larger ( at least 8 ' ' ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .,0

the sushi here is delicious !,2
"the sushi is as fresh as it comes ? you ' d think ocean was in their backyard , no joke !",2
the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick .,2
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded .,0
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa .,2
"the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse , the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice , good at their jobs and cultured .",2
the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy .,2
their apps are all delicious .,2
their crab eggs benedict is addicting .,2
"their specialty rolls are impressive , though i ca n ' t remember what we had .",2
there have been several occasions when we ' ve just not gotten some side dishes we ' ve ordered .,0
"there is only one place on the east coast that has it all , plus a lot more .",2
"there was a really nice vibe about the place . . . good music , atmosphere and happy looking people .",2
"they are n ' t the most talkative , but everytime i ' ve been there they have been very busy , which probably accounts for the lack of conversation .",1
they are not greasy or anything .,2
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting ; very light and not - too - sweet .,2
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from ; atlantic or pacific .,2
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it .,2
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls .,2
"they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .",0
"this establishment really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions ` ` diners , drive - ins , and dives ' ' hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .",0
this is a great place to get a delicious meal .,2
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned .,2
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat .,0
this is the case at this gem .,2
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer .,2
this place is charming and relaxing .,2
this place rocks ! !,2
"though , one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak .",0
"to be honest , i ' ve had better frozen pizza .",0
"to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange juice will cost you $ 3 .",0
"to start things off , our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order .",2
to the owners of open sesame . . . bravo . . . i ca n ' t wait to come back to dine at your restaurant !,2
to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .,0
"took forever to get our order taken , water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention .",0
try the chef ' s choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty .,2
try the pizza ensalata !,2
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner . . . they were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table .,0
two thumbs up !,2
um so now what are appetizers for ? ? ?,0
unbeatable sushi !,2
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i would n ' t recommend going here .,2
"untill this happens , my advice is to stay away .",0
very disappointed .,0
very disappointing,0

very poor customer service .,0
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd .,1
way over - rated ! ! ! !,0
we ' re ca n ' t say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza ’ s !,2
we ' re going back . : d,2
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant .,2
"we are locals , and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one - time customer tourists .",0
"we did have the same waiter the second time , so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good .",2
we easily spent more than $ 40 per person ( not including alcohol ) and were still hungry .,0
we had a very hard time getting the waitress ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .,0
"we have since returned and also had a great experience , sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer ( cold and good ) .",2
we left without ever getting service .,0
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes .,2
"we ordered a selection of the small plates , and the shoe string onions , goat cheese pizza , grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good .",2
"we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers , the food did n ' t arrive until 45 minutes later . . . with our main course .",0
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it ' d be a 30 minute wait .,0
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu .,2
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us .,0
we waited for an hour to be seated .,0
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 1 / 2 hours for our food .,0
"we went back to the restaurant and low and behold , we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago ! !",0
we were only in seattle for one night and i ' m so glad we picked rays for dinner !,2
"we were seated right away , the table was private and nice .",2
we were then charged for their most expensive sake ( $ 20 + per serving ) when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price .,0
well i guess it ' s hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff .,0
well worth it,2
what a find !,2
"what a tastly , flaky treat !",2
what else can you say nice people amazing food wow,2
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners of this establishment .,0
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy & the service was horrible !,2
"when i walked in , i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor .",2
"when the bill came , he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks .",0
"when we finally were able to flag someone down , it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food , who was also not the same person who had taken our order .",0
"while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us , our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one .",2
"while this diner had reasonably good food , the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence , and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service .",2
will definitely be back .,2
worst service i ever had,2
worth the wait,2
