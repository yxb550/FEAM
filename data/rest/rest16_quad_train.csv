the price very reasonable .,2
the prices are wonderfully low .,2
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .,2
"the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .",2
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service .,0
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews .,0
"the rest of the dim sum , though pricey by chinatown standards , is worth it .",2
"the restaurant has a family feel , not least with regard to the portions which are enormous ; the veal alone could have single - handedly solved third world famine .",2
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal,2
the restaurant is cute but not upscale .,1
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty .,2

"then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend ' s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .",0
"there ' s another girl who i ca n ' t describe , she is about 5 ' 6 ' ' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you ' re * really * talking about .",0
